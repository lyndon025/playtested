---

**Death Stranding 2** picks up the thread of its predecessor, expanding upon the contemplative, atmospheric journey that divided opinion when the first game released back in 2019 but still stands out for its unique vision, even more so now that the sequel has released. It takes everything that worked and refines it, delivering a game that is as much about emotional connection and storytelling as it is about traversal and survival.

## Pros
- 🎵 An epic and haunting soundtrack that deeply enhances the emotional impact  
- 🗺️ Vast and meticulously crafted open world that rewards exploration and patience  
- 🚶 A bold design choice to minimize fast travel, emphasizing the journey itself  
- 🕹️ Polished traversal and vehicle mechanics that add depth and variety  
- 🎭 Rich narrative with a star-studded cast and complex character development  

## Cons
- ⚖️ Gameplay difficulty reduced from the first, less challenging for veterans  
- 🔄 Frequent vehicle use sometimes diminishes the challenge of terrain traversal

The world of Death Stranding 2 is a stunning, somber landscape that invites you to slow down and take it all in. While most open-world games treat traversal as a chore to be skipped with fast travel, Death Stranding 2 once again makes the journey its central pillar. The challenge, the reward, and the true gameplay loop are not found at the destination cities, but out in the vast, unforgiving wilderness. The game is about the meticulous planning of your route, the management of your cargo's weight, and the struggle against the elements.
</div>

The core mechanic of Death Stranding 2 is about moving across varied and often treacherous but immensely cathartically beautiful terrain, using a range of vehicles and tools to navigate mountains, rivers, and obstacles. The idea that this game is a "Walking Simulator" is a complete and total misnomer that stems from a misunderstanding of its gameplay. While traversal is the main focus, that's precisely what sets this game apart from everything else. It's truly an experience you have to play to believe.

The traversal mechanics have seen significant improvements from the first game. Not all of them I liked, but I think its for the better. Players have a variety of vehicles and methodsat their disposal — a tri-cruise, a four wheel truck, a surfboard, and many more that you will discover when playing — allowing more dynamic movement across varied terrain. Yet, the game retains the challenge of negotiating difficult landscapes on foot, requiring thoughtful navigation, balance, and resource management. 

I love the feeling of traveling in this game. Unlike other titles where I would just follow a waypoint and beeline from point A to B without thinking, here the journey itself is the fun. The process is methodical and tactical: constantly scanning the terrain to find the safest path, checking the map for elevation changes, and carefully managing the weight of your cargo along with the equipment you need. It’s all part of a delivering a satisfying gameplay loop.

Even the simple act of moving is a deep mechanic. The constant micromanagement of steadying your stance on uneven ground, and scanning every square foot of terrain for dangers, while also managing cargo weight and stamina, which creates a realistic sense of effort and vulnerability. Planning routes to avoid hazards, conserve resources, or to know which tool to bring becomes a strategic puzzle, rewarding patience and foresight. 
</div>
This philosophy is reinforced by a host of brilliantly weird mechanics that are tailored specifically to this experience. The "Strand System," for example, is a unique form of asymmetric social multiplayer. What other game lets you send "Likes" to another player's perfectly placed ladder that helped you, which in turn makes more of their helpful structures appear in your game? This creates a compelling social loop where you are also motivated to build something useful in a clever spot just to earn Likes from others. These mechanics blend seamlessly with the environmental storytelling, making every journey feel personal and reflective.

The narrative remains a major selling point and only bolsters the strong quality offering of the game in literally all fronts. Boasting a star-studded cast that brings gravitas and nuance to an already complex script. Sprinkled with that trademark Hideo Kojima weirdness going on that only he can pull off. The story explores themes of connection, isolation, and the human condition in a fragmented world, continuing Kojima’s tradition of cinematic storytelling filled with mystery and emotional depth.

Although some players, especially first game veterans, might find the gameplay easier this time around - which could lessen the sense of accomplishment. However the trade off is the gains in accessibility, the game is now easier and the pacing is better, you get a vehicle pretty early in the story, making it more inviting to newcomers.

However, vehicle reliance, while expanding and making the traversal options easier, can at times trivialize parts of the exploration, reducing the tactile thrill of on-foot travel. There is a big disconnect between the screenshots or photomade shared on the internet (which are mostly on foot) and the actual gameplay, in which you will be probably using a vehicle or a fast form of travel for the majority of your traversal. I just wish they made more areas inaccessible or harder to drive on that you'd prefer moving on foot, but it's almost never the case for 95% of my experience.

Another thing that has significantly improved over the first game is the combat, as combat is now more frequent and intense, relying on a combination of a plethora of firearms, tools, and gadgets. When confronted by hostile entities or supernatural threats, players could rely on stealth, or use brute force firepower. Kinda some ways, it feels similar to MGSV with regards to the combat system, gunplay included. The delivery system is directly tied to the progression system and you get access to more equipment by delivering more cargo.

The overall immersion created by the music, story, and visuals is breathtaking. While playing, I constantly interrupted myself just to enter photo mode, admire the view, and take scenic shots. In fact, I basically paused every few minutes to take pictures, even during the cutscenes. The detailed world design and subtle cues scattered across the map reward curiosity and reflection, inviting players to engage deeply with its themes. The game is that beautiful and its probably the most good looking game I've played this year, excelling on every level with its technical photorealism, stunning visual quality, and masterful artistic direction. Let's me be clear: **Death Stranding 2** is a masterpiece of visual design and technical fidelity. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most stunning games ever created, setting a new benchmark for what is possible in real-time graphics. Not to mention that it is incredible optimized, as it is able to run at 1440p60fps on the base PS5 despite looking as good as it is, while also delivering blazing fast 1-2 second loading times from main menu to gameplay.

The game is a feast not just for the eyes, but for the ears as well as the music is absolutely fire. A big part of its unique atmosphere comes from its use of licensed, real-world music rather than a traditional orchestral score composed specifically for the game. This approach grounds the experience in a tangible reality, creating moments of startling beauty and reflection. In my opinion, I think more games and developers should explore using licensed tracks, even if licensing is difficult, as it can forge a powerful and distinct emotional connection that a conventional soundtrack sometimes can't.

### Conclusion
Death Stranding 2 is a bold artistic achievement that pushes the boundaries of what games can be. It succeeds by doubling down on the core design philosophy that made the original so unique: the entire game is built around the journey, not the destination. When you combine that philosophy with stunning visuals, perfectly curated soundtrack, an addicting gameplay loop, masterful storytelling, and stellar performances from its star-studded cast, the result is a game experience that is a true masterpiece and one of the most essential titles of the year.
