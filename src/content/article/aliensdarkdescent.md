 The gameplay of Aliens Dark Descent is built around commanding a squad of Colonial Marines through claustrophobic, hostile environments where every decision can mean the difference between life and death. The game immediately throws you into claustrophobic, hostile environments where every move matters, which is what Aliens is all about. 

 The core gameplay loop revolves around turn-based combat that demands careful planning and strategic use of each squad member‚Äôs abilities and equipment like Sentries, Hacking Tools, Medpacks, or Extra Ammunition. Positioning is critical, as Marines have varying weapon ranges, movement capabilities, and special skills. You‚Äôll find yourself constantly weighing the risks of advancing too quickly versus holding back to cover choke points or secure advantageous positions. Go too slow though and the enemy density increases, requiring you to pull back and come back another day. 
 
Go too slow, however, and the enemy density increases, requiring you to pull back and try again another day. You can retreat from missions at any time and come back later. There's an XCOM-like squad management system where you can research, upgrade, and heal teammates with a day-to-day progression system. Just as with the missions, if you take too many days, the overall density and aggressiveness of the enemies increase. Take even longer, and the campaign might just fail.
 Resource management plays a significant role, with limited ammo and medkits forcing players to prioritize targets and conserve supplies. The tension created by scarce resources complements the game‚Äôs horror tone, making each firefight feel urgent and dangerous. 

The level layouts often force you on long detours around broken bridges, locked doors, or barricaded hallways, some of which are very ridiculous because it would just be a minor thing to get past through, which can be predictable but also frustrating when objectives are just within sight. This design choice adds tension but occasionally feels like padding.

The enemy designs are excellent, with gruesome alien creatures and fearsome demons that look and feel threatening. The gore effects add to the grim sci-fi atmosphere, immersing you in the horror of the environment.

However, the difficulty balance can feel off. Sometimes, even large squads struggle to quickly dispatch enemies, especially human foes who soak damage, while other times the game feels easier. Certain bugs, such as enemies shooting through walls, break immersion and occasionally cause mission frustration.

Combat mechanics are a blend of old-school tactical shooters and modern turn-based strategy games. Its like a pausable real-time tactic game and unlike anything I have played before. Each action feels weighty, with careful consideration needed for movement, cover, and attack choice. While the interface and controls are mostly intuitive, occasional quirks in the UI hamper smooth gameplay flow especially if you're using controllers.

Overall, I had fun with the campaign and it was a nice tense experience all throughout. It satisfied my xeno-purging urges and my need for a tactical satisfaction. I played the game via gamepass but the game regularly goes on sale so definitely a mustplay on a sale if you like the premise of the gameplay.

### Conclusion

Aliens: Dark Descent is a solid tactical squad game that captures the dark sci-fi horror of the franchise with intense combat and a gripping atmosphere. Though hampered by level design frustrations and some technical issues, it provides a challenging and rewarding tactical experience for fans willing to overlook its flaws.
