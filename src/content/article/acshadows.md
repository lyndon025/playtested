**Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows** is an impressive entry in the Assassin‚Äôs Creed series that strips back the heavier RPG elements introduced in recent titles.

**Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows** is a beautiful game. Already from the get go, I was blown away by the graphics and the environments. The developers clearly poured immense care into crafting expansive, richly detailed locales that are not just visually stunning but feel alive. Whether it‚Äôs wandering through dense forests shrouded in morning winter mist, exploring rain-soaked cobblestone streets, or scaling sunlit towers against sprawling vistas, the game delivers a vivid sense of place and it clearly showcases the seasonal beauty of Feudal Japan like no other.

One of my favorite features is the dynamic weather system. Shifting fog, pouring rain, thick snow, and golden sunsets all dynamically impact the atmosphere, dramatically enhancing immersion. During one play session, a sudden storm rolled in while I was navigating through a remote village, the sound of rain pattering on rooftops and thunder rumbling in the distance truly pulled me deeper into the experience and took my breath away. It‚Äôs these moments where the game transcends typical open-world visuals and becomes an amazing experience.

The streamlined RPG mechanics make it much easier to jump in and enjoy the core gameplay without getting bogged down by complicated menus or inventory management. Not to mention they actually added controller navigation instead of that god awful mouse-like cursor-based navigation in the last few games. 

As for the equipment, the game has all the tools you will need. Various weapons are available for both Naoe and Yasuke, and they are all compelling to play with. The ability to upgrade all weapons and tailor your playstyle without constant gear switching is neat. You won't be forced to switch to a new ugly weapon with bad effects just because it is newer and has a higher level, because you can upgrade any weapons to keep up its level. There is no worry of looting a cool weapon too early rendering it unusuable in late game, unlike in other games.

Stealth is a joy here ‚Äî the AI responds believably (especially if you up the difficulty), and the variety of gadgets and tactics available means no two approaches have to feel the same. Whether creeping through shadows or launching surprise attacks from rooftops, the game empowers you with multiple ways to solve challenges. This allows for a more fluid stealth experience, where you can silently dispatch guards, distract enemies, and use environmental kills in creative ways. It's not just stealth that is done well here, but the traditional combat as well.

While Naoe is more of the traditional ninja or shinobe style, Yasuke is the unstoppable brute force of the game. His playstyle is the total opposite, there is significantly less emphasis on stealth and climbing, and more emphasis on breaking down stuff, engaging multiple opponents outloud, and throwing them around the place. Both characters have their own contrasts playstyles and you can switch between the two for the majority of the missions.

The story is solid and engaging, presenting well-developed antagonists with motivations that feel grounded and believable. The intro of the mysterious villains in particular was a very powerful scene that kept me hook and gave me a motivation to play from the start. It gave this western film vibes and is probably the best villain group introduction out of all the AC games so far. This narrative depth gives weight to your missions and makes your progression through the world feel meaningful.

Despite these strengths, the combat sometimes suffers from a lack of variety, feeling a bit repetitive over time, especially with the combat animations. Some encounters don‚Äôt demand much tactical thinking, which may disappoint players looking for more challenge. AI behaviors can occasionally feel inconsistent, with enemies missing obvious cues or acting unpredictably.

Minor technical issues like frame drops or clipping glitches don‚Äôt significantly mar the experience but are noticeable in a game otherwise so polished. Overall, the game is well optimized on both PC and consoles as I played on both PC and Xbox Series X via my Ubi+ subscription.

### Conclusion
**Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows** is a strong, focused entry that balances streamlined gameplay with some of the most gorgeous and immersive worlds in the series. Its breathtaking environments,  dynamic weather effects alone, and impressive, optimized graphics make it worth playing, while the refined stealth, brutal combat, and accessible mechanics make it enjoyable for both newcomers and veterans. Despite some combat repetition and minor technical hiccups, it‚Äôs a satisfying return to form for the franchise.
