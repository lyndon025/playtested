Pre-register

Starstride, an upcoming MMORPG blending elements of high fantasy and sci-fi, continues its journey with a new beta test, yet again inviting players to further explore its expansive universe, quickly following a previous test phase that started last January. The new beta runs from February 7 to February 20, 2024, and I was able to revisit and try out the game again.

Unlike previous tests, this time players will receive a substantial amount of in-game currency and item support, empowering them to customize their characters and gear to their liking.

⏫Notable Improvements
I was able to test this new beta version and immediately I noticed the more subtly refined combat system, featuring smoother animations, as well as improved combat flow between attacks. Players can anticipate a more seamless and engaging combat experience as they unleash devastating attacks and master their chosen combat styles.

Additionally, the progression system has been revamped, offering a more engaging first-time experience to guide players through the mechanics of the game. Overall, the performance of the game has seen a marked improvement across various aspects. I’m also seeing a lot more players now in the City Hub just running around making the world livelier than previous tests.

However, the removal of the auto-run feature, while it did have its share of bugs, has left a void in terms of convenient traversal between map objectives. Additionally, I've personally encountered issues with the minimap and quest markers, requiring a little bit of guesswork to locate objectives.

📖Story and Premise
The premise of Starstride revolves around future humans settling on a super earth alien planet, in there two allied factions, Neoterrans and Wokens, locked in a fierce conflict against a formidable alien civilization. As one of the few remaining powerful warriors, players must choose a faction and embark on a journey to become the ultimate Star Warrior. The game features a fusion of high fantasy and science fiction, featuring high-tech futuristic elements as well as mythological like-creatures such as Dragons and Gigantic Animals.

🎨Visuals and Art
The graphics are decent, and in some shots can look like AAA, but it’s inconsistent and needs more polish. The open world of the game features diverse environments from lush forests to futuristic cityscapes. The character designs visually striking and anime-like in its exaggerated armor designs and proportions, completing the game’s over-the-top action nature.

🎮Gameplay
Starstride offers a diverse range of gameplay mechanics, including exploration, questing, combat, and social interaction. Players can explore vast open-world environments, complete quests, engage in dynamic combat encounters, and interact with other players in the bustling City Hub. The game features a seamless blend of PvE and PvP content, providing players with a variety of opportunities for adventure and excitement.

⚔️Combat
Combat in Starstride is fast-paced and action-packed, with fluid animations and responsive controls. Weapons come in many shapes and sizes; Sword, Dual Blades, Shield, Spear, Hammer, and even a Whip. These weapons can be changed and equipped at any point in the game, and players have the flexibility to progress and upgrade them concurrently.

There is a dodge/roll mechanic that gives players a free slo-mo whenever you execute a perfect dodge, as well as “QTE” special attacks unique to each weapon, to finish enemies in style. Overall, combat in Starstride is less clunky than before, but its still clunky overall and needs more work to be actually good, but so far the work they’ve done and are doing is promising.

⏫Progression and eventual Monetization
The characters’ power armor and energy cores are the main centerfolds of the progression and character power. Upgrading them is the best way to get stronger. You have the freedom to create your own character (up to five on the same account), customize their appearance and gear, and choose their starting class. The foundations for microtransactions are already in place, including a gacha system — although I can’t seem to interact with these in-app purchases yet, similar to previous test versions.

⚖️Conclusion
Overall, while Starstride shows promise, it still requires further development before it can truly be enjoyable. It's evident that the game is still in its early stages and has room for improvement. However, this latest beta represents a positive step forward in the game's evolution.
