**Kingdom Come: Deliverance II** is a realistic, first-person, open-world RPG and serves as the direct sequel to the first game, the game continues the story of Henry of Skalitz, a common blacksmith's son thrust into the chaos of a 15th-century civil war in Bohemia. Players once again navigate a historically accurate medieval world, but on a much larger scale, featuring the bustling city of Kuttenberg, its surrounding vast countryside, and the region of Trosky. The game is renowned for its commitment to realism, ditching fantasy elements for a grounded experience focused on authentic combat, deep roleplaying systems, sim-like hardcore elements, and a story of revenge, politics, and personal growth.

The story is long but beautiful and incredibly rewarding. Its just really well-written, and it makes the whole world feel alive in addition to the already hardcore and sim-like nature. You can see this quality in everything, from Henry's main plot to even the smallest side quests. Because all the characters and situations feel so real and thought-out, the quests are more than just a checklist or a game length padder; they actually connect with you and are so well thought-out. There are so many memorable quests or encounters here, just like the first game. The different branching paths and tough choices get you invested, so you really care about what happens because of your actions. It just makes the game feel like a living world where your decisions truly matter.

It’s important to note, however, that this is a direct sequel. The narrative picks up right where the first game left off, and while it does a decent job of providing context through occasional exposition in some of the dialogue --- giving you a general idea of prior events, it’s still best experienced after playing the original to fully appreciate the single, continuous story.

The quest design in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is what makes the game truly exceptional. This is a legitimate role-playing game. Unlike many RPGs with linear objectives, quests here are complex, multi-layered problems that can be solved in numerous ways, encouraging true roleplaying. Nearly every quest has multiple outcomes based on your actions and choices. A simple task to retrieve a stolen item can end with you persuading the thief, intimidating him, stealing it back silently, or engaging in a messy brawl that draws the attention of the city guard. Your choices have real, often unforeseen, consequences that can even alter future quests and character relationships, up to the very end of the game. The game constantly rewards you for thinking like your character. A high Speech skill might allow you to talk your way out of a deadly confrontation, while a skilled Lockpicker can bypass a heavily guarded entrance entirely. Even your current gear or clothing affects the dialogue. Even your current gear or clothing affects the dialogue. For example, wear a knight's armor and you can probably intimidate your way out of conversations. Conversely, dress like a beggar and people will treat you like one.

Similar to the quest design, the story is filled with choices and branches that have a real impact, making every playthrough feel personal and unique. The world itself is a marvel, a historically accurate 15th-century Bohemia brought to life with painstaking detail. From a technical standpoint, the game is also a huge leap forward, running far more smoothly and with fewer bugs than the first game did at launch. It’s not 100% perfect, as I still encountered some quest logic bugs from time to time, but the overall experience is polished and stable. I can even run it on my Steam Deck at 30-40 FPS, which is highly impressive.

The game's combat is one of its most unique features, it is quite realistic, methodical, and hardcore. It is far from the usual when it comes to combat systems where you could usually take on many enemies at once, here, even one on one will be difficult enough. The system is a challenging dance of timing, positioning, and weapon choice that makes every encounter feel weighty and earned. 

My one and only significant gripe in this game is how the combat has devolved from the first game. The unique and quirky system is still there, but it has been simplified. Instead of six directional inputs for your attacks and blocks, the system is now down to four. The center attack was removed, and the lower left and right options were combined into one. While this might make the combat more approachable for newcomers and helped attract a more mainstream audience, I feel it has reduced the tactical depth that made the original’s swordplay so demanding and uniquely satisfying.

### Conclusion
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is the ultimate sandbox, the ultimate open-world, and literal role-playing game. It’s a title where the possibilities feel endless, a true medieval simulator that stands as one of the most immersive RPGs I have ever played. The sheer effort the developers invested into creating countless branching paths and quest outcomes is staggering; I can’t even imagine the complexity behind it. For this immersiveness factor alone, part of me wants this game to win Game of the Year, just so more people can recognize and appreciate what an incredible achievement this is.
