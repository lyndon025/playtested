**The Alters** is an unexpected ‚Äúsurprise game‚Äù of the year for me. At first, I didn't know what kind of game it was, aside from some online recommendations and getting the general gist of it from small glances. I initially thought it had similar vibes to Death Stranding, but then came the base-building mechanic similar to Fallout Shelter or XCOM. But then came the social survival and deep, thought-provoking existential themes within the characters and story, which is probably a signature for 11 bit studios, the same studio that made Frostpunk.
</div>
This is a game that wraps an addictive strategic loop inside a deep, thought-provoking narrative about existence itself, creating one of the most compelling and surprising experiences of the year.

At its core, The Alters features a deep and rewarding base-building loop that will hook anyone with a strategic mind. You are Jan Dolski, a simple worker stranded on a hostile alien planet, and your only hope for survival is a massive, mobile wheel base that you must constantly expand and maintain. The gameplay is an intricate dance of resource management; you'll send Alters out on expeditions, refine materials, manage power consumption, and carefully plan the layout of your base.

The building system itself is simple but effective, offering a great deal of freedom in how you construct and connect different modules. This freedom extends outside the base as well, allowing you to strategically place remote mining structures and link them back to your main facility with a network of power pylons. Exploration in The Alters is a another important part of the survival loop, driven by the constant, desperate need for resources to expand your base and keep your Jans alive. You'll need to scan the alien landscape to identify points of interest. These include rich resource deposits‚Äîlike metals, organic matter, or chemicals. This is where the tension comes in. The planet is bathed in lethal radiation from its star, and your Alters can only survive outside for a limited time before the radiation levels become fatal. As a player, you must manage this time limit carefully.

There's a tangible satisfaction, similar to games like Factorio or Satisfactory, that comes from creating a perfectly efficient, self-sustaining system that is safe from radiation, has decent food for everyone, plenty of extra supplies, and has enough power to move the base around. Something in your brain just clicks, compelling you to play for hours more just to optimize one more production line or research one more upgrade.

This addictive gameplay is in service of a narrative that is shockingly deep and can pull its own weight, and I would say, the story is so compelling and thought-provoking that it doesn't just pull its own weight, it probably carries the gameplay altogether. This is a signature of 11 bit studios, the same minds behind Frostpunk, and their talent for incorporating heavy themes into gameplay is on full display. The story tackles fascinating topics I had never considered before, all centered around cloning, alternate realities, and existential crises.

The true genius is in how you get more "workers": you create alternate versions of yourself, the Alters. These aren't just generic colonists; they are born from pivotal, life-altering decisions in Jan's past. What if Jan had become a scientist instead of a worker? What if he had pursued his passion for botany? You create these "what ifs" as living, breathing people. The narrative forces you to confront the consequences, as these Alters come with their own unique personalities, skills, memories, and traumas from the lives they lived. Managing their conflicting desires and shared existential dread becomes a core part of the social survival mechanics. The thought-provoking story alone would be worth the price of admission, but we're lucky that the addicting gameplay itself is also as strong.
</div>
Visually, the game has a distinct and powerful art style that creates a compelling, lonely atmosphere against the alien landscape. However, the polish is uneven, and you can clearly see some "UE5 jank" in places. My experience with performance was also a mixed bag. On a high-end PC (RTX 5080 and Ryzen 7 5700X3D), the game was unfortunately quite stuttery, with inconsistent framerates that broke the immersion. In contrast, the Xbox Series X version, despite having noticeably blurrier visuals, delivered silky-smooth performance.

### Conclusion
**The Alters** is a brilliant and unexpected fusion of addictive base-building strategy and compelling existential storytelling that truly makes it a unique experience that caters to your brain's dopamine receptors in more ways than one. Though hampered by the usual UE5 jank, its highly engaging gameplay loop and mature, thought-provoking themes make it a standout release that I simply could not put down until the end. It has firmly cemented its place as my "surprise game" of the year and a must-play for anyone seeking a survival game with both brains and a profound, melancholic heart.
