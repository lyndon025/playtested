game: Avowed
---

I went into **Avowed** with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much the game offered. While it clearly borrows from the Elder Scrolls formula, it carves out its own identity with strong RPG and skill check elements, tactical combat, and a large, immersive world.

## Pros
- üåÑ Large and beautifully detailed world with rewarding exploration  
- ‚öîÔ∏è Tactical, skill-based combat that requires strategy and timing  
- üé≠ Deep dialogue system with impactful skill checks and roleplaying options  
- üìö Helpful lore and contextual in-game explanations that keep you immersed  
- üé® Impressive Unreal Engine 5 visuals that bring the world to life, one of the best utilizations to date

## Cons
- üé≤ Loot can be inconsistent and frustrating, especially for magic builds  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Combat and progression scaling feel uneven, limiting the sense of power growth  
- üõ†Ô∏è Tedious looting and inventory management that can break immersion

**Avowed** has been getting a lot of undeserved hate lately, like many others that have launched recently (e.g., Veilguard or KCD2) or are upcoming (Intergalactic, AC Shadows, Ghost of Yotei). Many complaints dismiss it as "woke," label it as "Xbox Game Pass slop," or criticize it for not living up to Skyrim's standards, lumping it in with genuine trainwrecks like Concord or Suicide Squad. Honestly, that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.

Avowed‚Äôs world is vast and varied, ranging from sprawling ruins and ancient temples to dense forests and bustling settlements. The attention to detail is remarkable, with environmental storytelling woven throughout every location. The visuals are impressive, showcasing some of the best uses of Unreal Engine 5 with dynamic lighting, detailed textures, and impressive weather effects that truly enhance the atmosphere. The performance isn't half bad either, compared to other UE5 titles which are mostly bad in terms of optimization, especially regarding stuttering.

I didn‚Äôt go into this expecting a Skyrim clone, nor did I want one. Sure, it doesn‚Äôt have the same living, breathing open world or the NPC shenanigans The Elder Scrolls is known for, which most online video comparisons focus on. But where it absolutely shines is in the actual roleplaying: the companions (albeit limited), dialogue choices, exploration, and, without a doubt, the combat. 

The dialogue system features impactful skill checks that affect how conversations unfold and how you can roleplay your character. What I appreciated too was the in-game lore and explanations provided during dialogue, which helped keep me grounded in the world without needing to consult external sources.

Coming fresh from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, this game feels like a natural extension, with a huge emphasis on exploring ruins and wilds, opening hidden passageways, and using parkour. For its limited open world, the exploration is fantastic. 

Combat in Avowed on the other hand is tactical and engaging. It requires you to pay close attention to positioning, timing, and resource management, especially when using magic or ranged attacks. Unlike many action RPGs that encourage button mashing, Avowed rewards deliberate play and experimentation.

However, the loot is underwhelming. Whether it's my build, RNG, or just bad luck, the rewards rarely feel exciting. For my magic-focused build, I‚Äôve found six shields and not a single wand. This tedium almost negates the fun of exploration. Manually looting every single body for scraps is a chore, especially when they are hard to spot. There should be a more streamlined system for this by now.

The upgrade system is simplified, for better or worse. On the plus side, it allows you to carry a favorite early-game weapon through to the end. While the option to respec is welcome, the high cost discourages experimentation. I would have preferred it to be free.

Combat scaling also feels weird, reminiscent of Skyrim's level-scaling. Despite leveling up, I never felt significantly more powerful, though my resource management did improve. The dialogue includes skill checks, which is a great touch for roleplaying, but their outcomes can feel inconsistent. For example, passing a high-level "Might" check might still lead to a fight instead of successfully intimidating an opponent.

As for the world, I didn't find it confusing. I haven‚Äôt played Pillars, but I watched a few "Before You Play" videos, which may have helped. The game also includes a feature I love: a button you can press during dialogue to get context on highlighted lore terms, similar to Final Fantasy XVI and Metaphor. It‚Äôs a great way to keep players immersed without resorting to heavy-handed exposition.

I would give it a 7/10. It's by no means a bad game, but it feels like a "filler game" to me. I would recommend getting it on Game Pass or waiting for a deep sale. Despite its flaws, the game succeeds in creating a rich, atmospheric RPG world. The blend of narrative depth, exploration, and tactical combat kept me invested for over 60 hours.

### Conclusion

Avowed is a solid RPG that shines in exploration, combat, RP-ing, and storytelling, even if it stumbles on loot quality and its not the living breathing open world people want it to be. For players craving a deep, immersive RPG experience with meaningful roleplaying and a richly crafted world, Avowed is well worth your time, especially if you can look past its rougher edges.
