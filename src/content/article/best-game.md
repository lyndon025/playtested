Better late than never! 2025 has been an absolute banger for the industry. From the snowy peaks of the Yotei mountains to the chaotic, historical lands of medieval Bohemia, this year has proven that whether it's a massive AAA sequel or a bold, experimental indie, the bar for "immersion" has been set higher than ever before.

We’ve seen sequels that somehow perfected already "perfect" formulas and new IPs that caught us completely off guard. It wasn't just about better graphics or larger worlds; it was about games that respected our time, challenged our emotions, and refined the very genres they inhabit. Here are my Top 10 Games of 2025, ranked and reviewed. As well as special mentions of non-2025 games that I've played in 2025 anyway.

## **10. Arc Raiders**

**Rating: 8.8/10**
A masterclass in restraint within the extraction shooter genre. It strips away the unnecessary bloat to focus on what matters: tension and atmosphere.

> “Arc Raiders is a triumph of focused design and a well-appreciated refinement of the PvPvE extraction shooter genre... It creates an environment that is fun to exist in, even when the Arcs or the Raiders are trying to hunt you down.”

## **9. The Alters**

**Rating: 8.8/10**
My absolute "surprise game" of the year. It’s rare to find a game that feeds your dopamine receptors while simultaneously pulling at your heartstrings with such melancholic themes.

> “A brilliant and unexpected fusion of addictive base-building strategy and compelling existential storytelling... \[It's] a must-play for anyone seeking a survival game with both brains and a profound, melancholic heart.”

## **8. Dispatch**

**Rating: 9/10**
In an era of 100-hour epics, *Dispatch* is a breath of fresh air—a tight, episodic journey that feels incredibly full despite its shorter runtime.

> “If you want something that plays like an interactive TV season—with great jokes, strong characters, and just enough agency to make you sweat your choices—Dispatch is absolutely binge-worthy.”

## 7. Doom: Dark Ages

**Rating: 9/10**
Fast, refined, and unapologetically brutal. It manages to bridge the gap between the classic feel of the originals and the high-octane expectations of modern shooters.

> “Out of the three recent Doom games, I would say Doom: Dark Ages one is my absolute favorite... its combat flow, level design, and pacing deliver an engaging experience that fans of the series should not miss.”

## 6. Ghost of Yotei

**Rating: 9.1/10**
A masterclass in open-world pacing. It’s a game that respects the player's time while delivering a scale that feels immense, backed by some of the best art design in the business.

> “With its best-in-class combat, masterful art design, and flawless pacing, Ghost of Yotei is easily one of the best games of the year... the side quest content is absolutely on par with the quality of the main quest.”

5. Death Stranding 2

**Rating: 9.3/10**
Kojima doubles down on the "journey over destination" philosophy, resulting in a title that feels less like a product and more like a piece of high art.

> “A bold artistic achievement that pushes the boundaries of what games can be... a game experience that is a true masterpiece and one of the most essential titles of the year.”

## 4. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II

**Rating: 9.3/10**
The sheer ambition here is staggering. It’s not just an RPG; it’s a living, breathing medieval simulator that offers unparalleled freedom.

> “The ultimate sandbox... a title where the possibilities feel endless. For this immersiveness factor alone, part of me wants this game to win Game of the Year, just so more people can recognize and appreciate what an incredible achievement this is.”

## 3. Split Fiction

**Rating: 9.4/10**
The gold standard for co-op gaming. It’s a constant barrage of creativity that makes every hour spent with a friend feel like a discovery.

> “An absolutely mandatory purchase for anyone seeking a truly collaborative and awesomely cool gaming experience... Grab a friend and experience some of the most innovative design in modern gaming.”

## 2. Hades II

**Rating: 9.4/10**
How do you improve on perfection? Supergiant found a way. By shifting the focus to Magick and refining the progression, they’ve set a new high-water mark for the entire genre.

> “It takes a formula already considered perfect and somehow manages to expand it without adding bloat... Hades II is a mandatory purchase for any rogue-lite or hack and slash fans.”

1. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

**Rating: 9.4/10**
This is the one. A bold, creative, and emotionally resonant experience that excels in every single category—from the music to the strategic combat.

> “A unique masterclass experience that will appeal to players seeking both strategic combat and immersive storytelling... It is clear a forerunner for 2025’s Game oF The Year Award.”

## Honorable Mentions

*These weren't released in 2025, but they dominated my playtime anyway and deserve a seat at the table.*

* **[Persona 5 Royal](https://www.playtested.net/article/persona-5-royal/)** (9.5): "A total masterpiece... a benchmark in the JRPG scene."
* **[Haven](https://www.playtested.net/article/haven/)** (9.5): "A very calming, soothing, cozy experience... a game that will stick with me for years to come."
* **[Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition](https://www.playtested.net/article/cyberpunk2077/)** (9.5): "The best time to lose yourself in Night City."
* **[Metaphor: ReFantazio](https://www.playtested.net/article/metaphor/)** (9.3): "A masterful blend of the old and the new."

2025 reminded me why I love video games. Whether it was the stress of an extraction in *Arc Raiders,* experiencing the most fun and creative co-op adventure playing Split Fiction,  or the cozy exploration of *Haven*, these experiences stay with you long after you're done playing them (if ever). Here’s to whatever 2026 has in store for us!

Grand Theft Auto VI? Fable? Resident Evil Requiem? Crimson Desert? Tides of Annihilation? Control Resonant? Maybe we'll even see Half-Life 3 release this year!
