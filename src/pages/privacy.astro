            At <strong>{siteTitle}</strong> (accessible from <a href={siteUrl}
                >{siteUrl}</a
            >), one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This
            Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is
            collected and recorded by {siteTitle} and how we use it.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Log Files</h2>
        <p>
            {siteTitle} follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files
            log visitors when they visit websites. Most hosting companies do this
            as part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected by
            log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet
            Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and
            possibly the number of clicks.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
        <p>
            Like any other website, {siteTitle} uses 'cookies'. These cookies are
            used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages
            on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information
            is used to optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page
            content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Google DoubleClick DART Cookie</h2>
        <p>
            Google is one of a third-party vendor on our site. It also uses
            cookies, known as DART cookies, to serve ads to our site visitors
            based upon their visit to our site and other sites on the internet.
            However, visitors may choose to decline the use of DART cookies by
            visiting the Google ad and content network Privacy Policy at the
            following URL – <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads"

        </p>

        <h2>4. Our Advertising Partners</h2>
        <p>
            Some of advertisers on our site may use cookies and web beacons. Our
            advertising partners include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdSense</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third Party Privacy Policies</h2>
        <p>
            {siteTitle}'s Privacy Policy does not apply to other advertisers or
            websites. Thus, we are advising you to consult the respective
            Privacy Policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed
            information. It may include their practices and instructions about
            how to opt-out of certain options.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Information</h2>
        <p>
            Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while
            using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe,
            participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            {siteTitle} does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information
            from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided
            this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to
            contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove
            such information from our records.
