    "body": "**Assassin’s Creed Shadows** is an impressive entry in the Assassin’s Creed series that strips back the heavier RPG elements introduced in recent titles. Instead, it delivers a focused stealth and combat experience wrapped in some of the most breathtaking environments and immersive weather effects I’ve seen in the franchise.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🗡️ Toned-down RPG mechanics making gameplay more straightforward - 🌄 Stunning and detailed environments with dynamic weather that take your breath away - 🕵️ Strong stealth mechanics with a wide variety of tools and approaches - 🛠️ Quality-of-life features that enhance accessibility and player freedom - 🎭 Engaging story with well-crafted villains and believable motivations ## Cons\r\n- 🔄 Some fans may miss the depth and complexity of the RPG-heavy Assassin’s Creed entries - 🕹️ Combat can occasionally feel simplified and repetitive - ⚙️ Minor AI quirks and technical hiccups occasionally disrupt immersion One of my favorite features is the dynamic weather system. Shifting fog, pouring rain, thick snow, and golden sunsets all dynamically impact the atmosphere, dramatically enhancing immersion. During one play session, a sudden storm rolled in while I was navigating through a remote village, the sound of rain pattering on rooftops and thunder rumbling in the distance truly pulled me deeper into the experience and took my breath away. It’s these moments where the game transcends typical open-world visuals and becomes an amazing experience.\r\n</div>\r\nStealth is a joy here — the AI responds believably (especially if you up the difficulty), and the variety of gadgets and tactics available means no two approaches have to feel the same. Whether creeping through shadows or launching surprise attacks from rooftops, the game empowers you with multiple ways to solve challenges. This allows for a more fluid stealth experience, where you can silently dispatch guards, distract enemies, and use environmental kills in creative ways. It's not just stealth that is done well here, but the traditional combat as well. </div>\r\nDespite these strengths, the combat sometimes suffers from a lack of variety, feeling a bit repetitive over time, especially with the combat animations. Some encounters don’t demand much tactical thinking, which may disappoint players looking for more challenge. AI behaviors can occasionally feel inconsistent, with enemies missing obvious cues or acting unpredictably.\r\nMinor technical issues like frame drops or clipping glitches don’t significantly mar the experience but are noticeable in a game otherwise so polished. Overall, the game is well optimized on both PC and consoles as I played on both PC and Xbox Series X via my Ubi+ subscription.\r\n</div>",

    "description": "Alan Wake II is a survival horror game focused on storytelling, psychological horror, and survival. It features two playable stories with stunning graphics and a star-studded cast.",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",

    "body": "✨Overview Alan Wake II is a survival horror game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Epic Games. The game is designed as a single-player experience, focusing on storytelling, psychological horror, and survival elements. It features a unique format, divided into two separate single-player stories, each playable in any order the player chooses.\r\nI'm a big fan of Remedy's single-player experiences, from the good old days of Max Payne 1 and 2 to following the long winded development of Alan Wake with its eventual release on the Xbox 360. More recently, the highly praised Control. Every game has been great so far. Alan Wake 2 aims to continue that tradition while also pushing the boundaries of graphics fidelity and storytelling in a singleplayer experience. Well, is it successful?\r\n## Pros\r\n- Gripping and masterful storytelling - Next-gen level of visuals - Amazing sound design - Stellar cast of new and familiar faces - Non-linear style of chapters - A terrifying psychological survival horror experience ## Cons\r\n- Mind Place feels too cumbersome at times as both a gameplay element and a menu system - Cheap use of jumpscares, it doesn’t really need them - Pacing can be quite slow, especially if you’re used to Quantum Break and Control ## 📖Story and Premise Set 13 years after the events of the first game, the story once again revolves around the protagonist, best-selling horror novelist Alan Wake, and an FBI agent named Saga Anderson. Alan Wake, the central character, is trapped in a nightmarish realm known as the Dark Place, while Saga Anderson and his partner, Alex Casey, investigate mysterious murder cases in Bright Falls. The game weaves a complex narrative that combines elements of horror, psychological thriller, and supernatural mystery. Further in the game’s narrative, players can take on the role of either Alan Wake or Saga Anderson, and their stories are interconnected, providing different perspectives on the unfolding mystery.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style Graphics-wise, this is perhaps one of the most technically impressive and good-looking games that were released this year. The game features highly realistic character models, dynamic lighting, and shadow effects that enhance the sense of unease and tension, which are core elements of the gameplay. The contrast between light and shadow is used to create terrifying and visually striking scenes. The game incorporates surreal audiovisual and supernatural elements into its visuals, as well as the use of live-action elements in tandem with its game engine. The game's graphics seamlessly blend these elements, creating an unsettling and mysterious atmosphere.\r\nThere is also support for ray tracing, path tracing, and frame-gen technologies. Instead of its publisher's own Unreal Engine 5, it uses Remedy’s Northlight engine, which is a rare thing to happen and would only mean that Northlight is THAT good for Epic to approve the non-use of their own Unreal Engine.\r\n## 📺Presentation The game is told in a TV series-like format, complete with an end-of-chapter song and a quasi-cliffhanger to end them (although nothing is stopping you from continuing the game). I actually love their approach with this one, and these subconsciously served as my personal indicators to take a few minutes' break from playing the game or perhaps an indicator to continue the game at another time. The game is a slow burn; the pacing REALLY is slow. It takes a while to see the first action that you’ll experience in this game, and even then, the action-packed bits are few and far between. There’s lots of walking, investigation, and backtracking, especially with the game’s new “Mind Palace” feature, aptly named “Mind Place”. Which CAN be confusing.\r\nThe game is brilliantly acted by a star-studded cast, some new and some familiar, returning from both Alan Wake 1 and other Remedy games, such as head writer Sam Lake’s likeness, Max Payne’s voice actor, and even Quantum Break’s main actor is playing a character here. The sound design is equally as brilliant, even the simple swaying of grass or sudden creaking of walls is a terrifying experience.\r\nHowever, one thing I didn't like about this game is that, even though it doesn’t need it, it still has cheap jump scares and sudden high-pitched audio bits to scare the player. It felt unnecessary and out of place, especially when you are playing as the much more composed Saga.\r\nAlan Wake II is made so that you can experience the story without playing the first game, but there are some nice callbacks and references, both minor and major, to the first game, as well as Remedy’s other games, especially Control. Frankly, Even I have vague memories of the first game’s narrative, but I do remember the iconic locations and places in it. Because of this, I watched a YouTube recap to refresh my memory of the plot before starting.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay In terms of gameplay, it is much closer to the original Alan Wake than Remedy’s recent explosive and physics-based destructive games like Quantum Break and Control. It plays like a modern third person survival horror game, such as Resident Evil 2 or 3, but with more psychological thriller vibes that will mess with your head, senses, and terrify you without much physical effort.\r\nThe game's focus on narrative and atmosphere is evident in the gameplay. Players are frequently tasked with solving environmental puzzles and navigating the map while using their wits and a limited arsenal. The game encourages exploration and rewards players with hidden lore, resources, upgrades, and collectibles. While it might not be as action-packed as some of Remedy's previous titles, it is a conscious decision that aligns with the horror genre.\r\nOne of the main innovations in Alan Wake II is the introduction of the “Mind Place.” This essentially functions as a 3D menu and is representation of the characters’ minds where players can gather clues and reconstruct the narrative by exploring the minds of key characters. This gameplay element is used for both Alan and Saga and provides an intriguing twist to the gameplay. It not only deepens the psychological horror aspects but also empowers players to actively participate in the storytelling process, which is a unique and engaging feature.\r\nAdditionally, the game allows for free exploration of the town of Bright Falls. Players can investigate locations, and interact with NPCs. This open-ended approach enhances the game's sense of immersion and provides a break from the main storyline. While these activities might not be as compelling as the central narrative, they contribute to the game's world-building and character development.\r\nThe aforementioned Mind Place is a neat, expanded pause feature, but I felt that it was overly expanded and too cumbersome to operate with the current controls it has. Every little thing you find around the world must be organized into the Mind Place a bit too manually, and I found it too troublesome to interact with every now and then to progress the investigation.\r\n## ⚔️Combat Combat in Alan Wake II is an intense and anxiety-inducing experience. The game focuses on a limited supply of resources such as Ammo, Medpacks, and Batteries, so players must think strategically about their approach. There's a deliberate tension in the scarcity of supplies, especially the batteries for your flashlight, which is your primary tool for combating the supernatural forces of darkness.\r\nThe combat mechanics feel tighter and more responsive compared to the original game. The use of light as a weapon remains a central element of the gameplay. Focusing your flashlight on the shadowy entities weakens them, and players must cleverly manage their flashlight's battery life during encounters. The tension of watching the battery deplete while surrounded by eerie enemies adds layers of fear and excitement to every fight.\r\n## ⏫Progression The game includes detective elements, with Saga Anderson using Mind Place for investigation to a Players can connect clues on a pinboard, piece together the main mystery, and profile characters to gather clues. Alan Wake’s also has a version of the Mind Place, called “Writer's Room”, which has a different function. Instead of investigation, it allows Alan to affect the reality around him by helping him rearrange and shape his plot while he writes it. The game also features manuscript pages to collect that foreshadow upcoming events or narrate current things as they happen, a returning element from the first game.\r\nFresh from Spider-Man’s GTA V-like character switching and Lords of the Fallen's dual reality setup, Alan Wake continues the trend by combining both elements into one innovative but familiar feature: Alan Wake 2 features the ability to play chapters in whichever order you want. This feature arrives a bit further into the game at around 5 hours, but it is a core feature of the game from then on. You can switch characters in Alan Wake II at almost any point in any break room you encounter. Saga and Alan both have their own separate chapters, and you’re free to complete them in any order.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance Despite initial concerns about the game’s high system requirements, the game isn’t as bad as the system requirements or the news make it out to be. It still delivers both excellent graphics and performance, on lower than expected hardware. Visually, even just the low and medium preset on PC looks good already, and is already on par with modern-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The game incorporates ray tracing, path tracing, and frame generation technologies, as well as support for FSR and DLSS. My PC ran it surprisingly well, hovering at around 60FPS on my i7-8700k RTX 3080 at 1440p resolution, using a mix of medium and high settings with ray tracing turned off. There is a bit of texture pop-ins especially when switching to Map and the Mind Place, but it isn’t a huge deal breaker for me.\r\n### Conclusion\r\nAlan Wake II is an ambitious game that manages to deliver on its ambitious goals, offering an innovative and terrifying experience executed with confidence and expertise built from years of experience. The sequel retains the essence of the original game while expanding its scope and narrative complexity. Sure, the pacing could be a little bit better, but the game's survival horror elements, combat system, and progression mechanics are well-implemented nonetheless, making it a modern classic in the horror genre. The game introduces intriguing meta-narrative elements, further enhancing its appeal to fans of Remedy's previous works and the Remedy Connected Universe.",

    "body": "**Aliens: Dark Descent** delivers on intense, squad-based tactical combat in a dark sci-fi setting that fans of the franchise will appreciate. However, its frustrating level design, sometimes buggy pathfinding and immersion-breaking bugs sometimes pull the experience down.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 💥 Intense, tactical squad combat requiring careful planning - 👹 Detailed enemy designs, especially aliens and demons, that look great - 🌌 Strong sci-fi atmosphere with well-crafted gore and effects - 🧠 Challenging gameplay that rewards strategic thinking - 🎮 Tactical gameplay blends classic and modern influences effectively ## Cons\r\n- 🗺️ Annoying level design with inconvenient illogical blocked paths and detours - 🐛 Occasional immersion-breaking bugs, like units shooting or attacking through walls - ⚔️ Damage output and enemy toughness sometimes feel unbalanced - 🕹️ Minor UI and control quirks hamper smooth gameplay The gameplay of Aliens Dark Descent is built around commanding a squad of Colonial Marines through claustrophobic, hostile environments where every decision can mean the difference between life and death. The game immediately throws you into claustrophobic, hostile environments where every move matters, which is what Aliens is all about. The core gameplay loop revolves around turn-based combat that demands careful planning and strategic use of each squad member’s abilities and equipment like Sentries, Hacking Tools, Medpacks, or Extra Ammunition. Positioning is critical, as Marines have varying weapon ranges, movement capabilities, and special skills. You’ll find yourself constantly weighing the risks of advancing too quickly versus holding back to cover choke points or secure advantageous positions. Go too slow though and the enemy density increases, requiring you to pull back and come back another day. Go too slow, however, and the enemy density increases, requiring you to pull back and try again another day. You can retreat from missions at any time and come back later. There's an XCOM-like squad management system where you can research, upgrade, and heal teammates with a day-to-day progression system. Just as with the missions, if you take too many days, the overall density and aggressiveness of the enemies increase. Take even longer, and the campaign might just fail. Resource management plays a significant role, with limited ammo and medkits forcing players to prioritize targets and conserve supplies. The tension created by scarce resources complements the game’s horror tone, making each firefight feel urgent and dangerous. The level layouts often force you on long detours around broken bridges, locked doors, or barricaded hallways, some of which are very ridiculous because it would just be a minor thing to get past through, which can be predictable but also frustrating when objectives are just within sight. This design choice adds tension but occasionally feels like padding.\r\nThe enemy designs are excellent, with gruesome alien creatures and fearsome demons that look and feel threatening. The gore effects add to the grim sci-fi atmosphere, immersing you in the horror of the environment.\r\nHowever, the difficulty balance can feel off. Sometimes, even large squads struggle to quickly dispatch enemies, especially human foes who soak damage, while other times the game feels easier. Certain bugs, such as enemies shooting through walls, break immersion and occasionally cause mission frustration.\r\nCombat mechanics are a blend of old-school tactical shooters and modern turn-based strategy games. Its like a pausable real-time tactic game and unlike anything I have played before. Each action feels weighty, with careful consideration needed for movement, cover, and attack choice. While the interface and controls are mostly intuitive, occasional quirks in the UI hamper smooth gameplay flow especially if you're using controllers.\r\nOverall, I had fun with the campaign and it was a nice tense experience all throughout. It satisfied my xeno-purging urges and my need for a tactical satisfaction. I played the game via gamepass but the game regularly goes on sale so definitely a mustplay on a sale if you like the premise of the gameplay.\r\n### Conclusion",

    "description": "Batman Arkham Asylum is the origin of the acclaimed Arkham series. Its tight combat, horror vibe, and claustrophobic levels still deliver a thrilling superhero experience years later.",

    "body": "**Batman Arkham Asylum** remains a cornerstone of superhero gaming. Released over a decade ago, its blend of stealth, combat, and atmospheric horror still resonates today. Set entirely within the confines of Arkham Asylum, this game is less an open-world adventure and more a tightly woven, claustrophobic detective thriller, while also emphasizing Batman’s early encounters with iconic villains. I beat this game a decade ago but i have recently revisited it so I could continue to the sequels, which I had never played yet.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🦇 Tight, fluid combat mechanics that feel rewarding - 🎃 Unique horror atmosphere rarely seen in superhero games - 🏢 Compact but detailed level design within Arkham Asylum - 🎭 Strong narrative focus on Batman and the Joker without origin retreads - 🎮 Gameplay balanced between stealth, puzzle-solving, and combat ## Cons\r\n- 🔒 No open world—levels feel restrictive compared to successors - 😰 Some players may find the claustrophobic setting limiting - 📺 UI and presentation are dated compared to newer entries Walking into Arkham Asylum for the first time feels like stepping into a dark, twisted comic book come to life. Unlike many superhero games that try to capture the bustling streets of a city, Arkham Asylum chose lock itself into a confined, eerie space that shapes the entire experience. The facility feels like a living, breathing character—full of shadows, foreboding corridors, and the unsettling sense that something could go wrong at any moment.\r\nThe developers nailed the tone and atmosphere, delivering a gritty and oppressive horror vibe that sets this game apart from most superhero titles. Even the Halloween-inspired UI, the haunting sound design, and the dimly lit interiors all contribute to a palpable tension that keeps you on edge. It’s not just about punching thugs or solving puzzles; it’s about surviving in an insane place that feels as dangerous as the villains it holds.\r\nThe story wastes no time plunging you into Batman’s world. This is a Batman who is already fully formed, a dark knight with years of experience behind him. The game bypasses origin stories and goes straight to the confrontation with the Joker, a villain as chaotic as he is charismatic. The cast of characters you meet is rich and varied, featuring many of Batman’s iconic foes, each brought to life with remarkable fidelity to their comic book roots.\r\nThe combat system is one of the best parts of Arkham Asylum, setting a new standard when it first launched. The “freeflow” combat mechanic is fluid and intuitive, rewarding timing, counters, and creativity. Each encounter feels dynamic, whether you’re facing a single opponent or a group. The addition of gadgets and environmental takedowns adds depth without overwhelming the player. Its a shame that this kind of combat is not being used as much today by the industry, instead pivoting more to the endless Souls-like combat system games that we have today.\r\nStealth sections are well integrated, giving you the chance to sneak past enemies or take them down silently. This balance between combat and stealth makes the gameplay varied and prevents the experience from feeling repetitive.\r\nLevel design is tight and purposeful. Without the freedom of an open world, every corridor and room feels meticulously crafted to enhance the story and gameplay. There’s a constant feeling of progression, of peeling back layers of Arkham’s mystery as you advance. Though some players might find the lack of freedom to move restrictive, especially since Batman is known to operate as well in open areas like gliding and swinging through rooftops and buildings. Stil, the level design strengthened the narrative and mood, creating an intense, immersive, claustrophobic experience.\r\nThe game does show its age in some UI and graphical aspects, but its artistic direction still holds up well. The detailed character models and atmospheric lighting maintain a strong sense of immersion. Especially if you can play on PC which automatically gets you a sort of a \"remastered\" version with an unlocked framerate and resolution.\r\n### Conclusion\r\nEven more than a decade later, **Batman Arkham Asylum** stands as a landmark title that reshaped superhero games. Its compelling blend of tight combat, horror atmosphere, and strong narrative laid the groundwork for an acclaimed series. For anyone interested in Batman or action games with a dark twist, Arkham Asylum remains a must-play classic that rewards patience and skill with a uniquely immersive experience. It has a very different and unique vibe than the rest of games that you will either like it more or like it less than the other games in the series.",

    "body": "After the success of Arkham Asylum, **Batman Arkham City** took the Dark Knight’s adventures to an open-world playground inside a massive prison district of Gotham. This game was exactly what I hoped for, offering more freedom, diverse environments, and deeper gameplay without losing the series’ signature atmosphere.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🏙️ Open-world design offers more freedom and variety - 🦸 Combat refined with new moves and multi-enemy counters - 🐱 Playable Catwoman sections add diversity - 🔓 Gradual unlocks keep progression engaging and balanced - 🎨 Art direction that still looks stunning years later ## Cons\r\n- 🐢 Slow initial pacing before the city opens up - 🧩 Riddler collectibles can be tedious and frustrating - 🏙️ Still feels like one long continuous mission more than true sandbox - 📖 Story can be all over the place Now here is basically what I dreamed the next game should be while I was playing Asylum. Which is to do Open World. It's not the whole Gotham City unlike Open World Spider-Man games getting New York, but Arkham City is a nice compromise nonetheless. The game is now open world, and I feel more free in playing as Batman now. More city street environments, gliding in open world, grappling hook to climb buildings, and jumping rooftop to rooftop. The chance to play as Catwoman from time to time is just icing on the cake. It started slow, probably a factor why I couldn't really get into it, but once the city opens up it becomes loads of fun.\r\nArkham City’s open-world design lets you truly feel like you’re patrolling Gotham. The city feels dense and alive with its crowded rooftops, streets, and alleys, all bursting with activity and side content. Gliding through the cityscape on Batman’s cape and climbing with the grappling hook are incredibly satisfying, giving you a real sense of power and freedom. However, it still gives that feeling that the game is very large one continuous quest/mission, and it still felt a little claustrophobic because I was kinda stranded to Arkham City and its momentous event. I hated the now more annoying Riddler collectibles too and never bothered with that, as the sheer volume of collectibles can feel tedious and grindy, pulling you away from the main narrative at times.\r\nCombat has been polished further and much more fluid and easier to do combats, with new moves and counter mechanics that reward creativity, especially in larger groups. The ability to chain counters and fluidly transition between enemies makes fights feel exhilarating rather than repetitive. Multiple counters being my favorite added feature (similar to how it evolved in Assassin's Creed games). The progression is also super engaging and It was awesome unlocking new stuff and the pace to unlock things are done just right it never really feels grindy. Unlocking new gear feels meaningful and encourages exploration.\r\nAdding playable Catwoman sections was a great move, offering fresh stealth gameplay with different mechanics and abilities. This variety keeps the experience interesting and adds narrative depth.\r\nGraphics wise, playing it 11 years later, it really aged exceptionally well especially how the art style is. Playing it on the Steam Deck, it can still go toe to toe with modern titles as far as visuals go (not to mention gameplay too), especially in today's blurry TAA/upscaling infested AAA market. I even beat like the last few hours of the story on my PC on a big monitor at max graphics and it still looked impressive and really aged very well! Arkham Asylum's graphics isn't much different from this so if you're worried about visuals not holding up in 2024 and beyond, don't worry, it still holds up.\r\nI do have some criticisms about the Story, it was all over the place. The main villain is severely underutilized in favor of yet again a more popular villain, who ends up dominating much of the narrative. All while unnecessarily shoehorning another popular villain as a key player as well, which can feel a bit forced or rushed, as if the game is trying to cram in as many iconic Batman characters as possible.\r\n### Conclusion\r\n**Batman Arkham City** successfully expands the series’ formula into a vibrant urban playground while maintaining the core strengths of fluid combat, deep storytelling, and immersive stealth. It balances freedom and narrative in a way few superhero games have since. If Arkham Asylum set the stage, Arkham City truly lets you play the Dark Knight on your own terms.",

    "body": "**Batman Arkham Knight** is the pinnacle of the Arkham series, delivering the most expansive Gotham yet, refined combat mechanics, and the long-awaited introduction of the Batmobile as a playable vehicle. This title brings together everything fans loved and adds new dimensions, though it occasionally leans too heavily on vehicle combat segments.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🌆 Vast, detailed Gotham city full of side quests and secrets - 🦇 Refined combat system with a broad moveset and gadgets - 🚗 Playable Batmobile integrated into both combat and puzzle-solving - 🎯 Engaging main story with memorable villains and twists - 🎨 Excellent visuals and sound design pushing the series forward ## Cons\r\n- 🚙 Over-reliance on Batmobile sequences and tank battles, to the point that it became annoying - 🎮 Some boss fights feel repetitive or frustrating - ⚙️ Performance issues, especially on less powerful hardware Arkham Knight offers the largest and most detailed open world in the series, packed with diverse environments ranging from gritty industrial zones to towering skyscrapers, as the open world is now a huge chunk of Gothan City itself. Traversing the city, whether gliding over rooftops or driving through the streets, feels exhilarating and immersive.\r\nThe combat system continues to impress, blending fluid freeflow mechanics with an extensive range of gadgets and combos. Batman’s agility and tactical prowess make each encounter satisfying, whether facing thugs, assassins, or supervillains.\r\nI found the story compelling and it has mostly kept me hooked from start to finish. It felt like a Hollywood-style high stakes Batman action movie, with enough twists and turns to keep things interesting. The use of villains were much more balanced here and much more detailed. However its seems that towards the tail end of the main story it ran out of fuel to make things interesting for me. Beyond the Main storyline, the side quests feel like they're an integral part of the main story, rather than just optional distractions. This side quests compelled me to actually complete them instead of ignoring most of them.\r\nAt first, I was actually invested in the Riddler side story now in this one after almost fully ignoring him in Arkham City and Origins (though I did manage to complete it in Asylum). That alone speaks for how compelling quests in general is for me. However after I was done with the main bulk of his side quest, it became annoying once again and we're back to IGNORING him again because of the forced collectibles. Although there is indeed a mod that allows you to skip the trophies to skip to the end part.\r\nA minor thing I hate though, is the jumpscares, because i hate jumpscares, and it being in this game, instead of a lets say horror where you can expect one every moment, really worsens it.\r\nAs with the main story, of course the game needs a grandiose event once again to provide that \"gameplay battleground\" just like Arkham City, and in some ways like in Arkham Asylum. It's a little bit disappointing not being able to play as Batman on a regular night in Gotham, like in Batman Arkham Origins, but I guess for the sake of good gameplay and open world level design it has to happen.\r\nHow they explained the world’s state — the lack of civilians and regular people — it was done decently anyway. My only gripe/pet peeve is that they hired Jonathan Banks to voice commissioner Gordon, and every time I hear his voice, I hear Mike from Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul, and I just can't stop associating his voice from it.\r\nThe long awaited introduction of a playable Batmobile finally is pretty awesome, as we never got to use it playing the previous three games. However, I couldn’t help but feel that there’s too much reliance on it, perhaps it is forced too much on the player. Tank battles are so frequent that I'm almost playing a tank combat game instead of a Batman game. The heavy tank combat use at certain points detracts from the Batman experience. Almost every point of my annoyance in the gameplay is related to the Batmobile segments or boss fights, especially towards the end of the game like this one specific chase/drill boss fight.\r\nHowever aside from this, all the other Batmobile aspects are done very well. How it is incorporated to the puzzle solving mechanics is done beautifully, as well as the ability to remote control the car and use it in certain situations. The pathfinding and how you call the batmobile is pretty badass too and done really well. Handling is pretty good for the most part and you can easily drive like Batman throughout Gotham City, barring some minor physics quirkiness especially if you're trying some jumps or high speed maneuvers, which are kinda annoying too but it didn't detract much from the overall experience.\r\nThe skill progression and challenges in the game = well done. The best in the series, gone are the Origins type of progression where you need specific challenges to unlock stuff, and back are the XP/Skill point based unlocks of Arkham City, albeit done with more both style and substance.\r\nAs for the combat, it also feels like the peak of the series in terms of mechanics, with a wide range of moves and gadgets that allow for creative gameplay, which are also well integrated with the aforementioned progression system. However, the combat feels a bit too \"arcadey\" now, compared to the more grounded, tactical approach of the earlier games. While it might be easier and feels more video game-y, it’s undeniably fun and offers plenty of variety for players who enjoy experimenting with different combos and strategies.\r\nOne more criticism I have for this game is the optimization, which can be justified because the game has really good visuals for its time anyway, and can even pass as a game made today. Nowadays though, you can pretty much brute force good performance in this game with new hardware, but I can still feel the stutters sometimes. On the Steam Deck in which I play when I'm out of the house, Arkham Knight is the only game in the Batman Arkham series that failed to have a locked 60fps experience, with dips to the high 30s.\r\nThis is just simply The peak Batman video game experience. Gameplay wise its the ultimate evolution of what has been done in previous games. Level design-wise, its also the ultimate evolution because you now get a bigger open world that feels much more like a real City. Still not a huge New York city like in the Spider-Man games, but a city that feels like a city nonetheless. It feels detailed and immersive enough to give a real sense of scale.\r\n### Conclusion\r\n**Batman Arkham Knight** stands as a fitting and thrilling conclusion to the Arkham saga, delivering a rich, expansive Batman experience with many memorable moments. While it occasionally stumbles with an overemphasis on Batmobile combat and minor technical issues that has since been mostly bruteforced by modern hardware anyway, it remains a must-play for fans of the series and superhero action games in general.",

    "body": "**Batman Arkham Origins** serves as a worthy prequel to the acclaimed Arkham series, exploring Batman’s early years as a vigilante in Gotham. While it refines many elements of the series’ formula and offers a darker, grittier narrative, it struggles to reach the polish and impact of its predecessors.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🌃 More open and detailed Gotham city to explore - 🦸 Familiar, fluid combat with refinements - 🎯 Intriguing story focusing on younger Batman’s struggles - 🔓 Improved mission variety and side content - 🎨 Strong voice acting and atmospheric audio ## Cons\r\n- 🐢 Progression system feels more restrictive and less rewarding - 🏙️ Some missions feel repetitive and padded - ⚙️ Technical glitches and bugs occasionally break immersion I don't really get the hate for Origins, especially in retrospect when newer Batman games have come out. Origins just continued the Batman Arkham series, retained most of the gameplay and refined it, while introducing a new story, a prequel at that. Its sad that this game gets flak even up to now and not even considered as part of the series in some releases, like being omitted from the \"Arkham Trilogy\" release.\r\nLike other Arkham games though and contrary to the \"Origins\" title, we still get an experienced Batman here, albeit way less than previous games, and still skips right past the actual origin of the character. I feel like the story here is better than City purely because it is paced better and isn't as convoluted. The setup of assassins being hired to take down Batman is actually dope AF in setting him up for these various villains, no overly complicated reason for every one of these villains was needed other than just the \"kill batman contract\". You also get intrigued with what happened in Batman's early years, such has his early interactions with Police, Gordon, Barbara, Alfred, and the Villains.\r\nThe open world also feels much better for me. It now feels like a regular night in Gotham because there isn't a hellish grandiose event happening, unlike in Arkham Asylum or City where it goes to hell and you're stuck in it. It even reinforces that feeling by allowing you to go back to the Batcave any time and you can fast travel around the city. The game features several interesting side quests and activities, though some can feel repetitive and padded, diminishing the overall pace. I still hate the Riddler collectibles. Yet again, similar but not to the same extent as in Arkham City, the main villain is underutilized in favor of THAT villain, who ends up dominating much of the narrative yet again. One additional thing I disliked about it was the progression system which was a huge step back, and how restrictive it felt compared to Arkham City. Upgrades are now locked behind unrelated upgrades, and some upgrades require completing specific challenges instead of being unlocked with the usual skill points gained from leveling up.\r\nThe graphics look awesome as well and have aged well, but there are diminishing returns from Asylum/City and it doesn't look much significantly better but consumed way more resources than Asylum and City. I like the new Batsuit, although it is more live action-looking instead of comic-book looking. While others may say it breaks immersion by being more advanced than the later Batsuits, you can kinda make sense of it by explaining that Batman needed more protection in his early years, while in the later years he is more confident now of his skills, and prefers to reduce protection for better agility. Or the Batsuit tech has improved that it has less volume for the same amount of protection.\r\nCombat remains tight and satisfying, closely following the successful freeflow system. The refinements make fights feel smoother, especially with new gadgets and counter moves. However, the progression system is a step back, locking upgrades behind unrelated challenges or missions rather than straightforward skill points, which can feel frustrating.\r\nTechnical issues, such as bugs and occasional frame drops, sometimes pull you out of the immersive experience, but the strong voice acting and sound design largely compensate.\r\n### Conclusion\r\nWhile **Batman Arkham Origins** may not reach the heights set by Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, it remains a worthwhile prequel that deepens Batman’s lore and offers a compelling, if rougher, take on the Dark Knight’s early vigilante days. Fans seeking a darker narrative and expanded Gotham will find plenty to enjoy despite its flaws. If you want to play the whole series from start, Definitely don't skip it.",

    "body": "I went into **Avowed** with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much the game offered. While it clearly borrows from the Elder Scrolls formula, it carves out its own identity with strong RPG and skill check elements, tactical combat, and a large, immersive world.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🌄 Large and beautifully detailed world with rewarding exploration - ⚔️ Tactical, skill-based combat that requires strategy and timing - 🎭 Deep dialogue system with impactful skill checks and roleplaying options - 📚 Helpful lore and contextual in-game explanations that keep you immersed - 🎨 Impressive Unreal Engine 5 visuals that bring the world to life, one of the best utilizations to date\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🎲 Loot can be inconsistent and frustrating, especially for magic builds - ⚖️ Combat and progression scaling feel uneven, limiting the sense of power growth - 🛠️ Tedious looting and inventory management that can break immersion **Avowed** has been getting a lot of undeserved hate lately, like many others that have launched recently (e.g., Veilguard or KCD2) or are upcoming (Intergalactic, AC Shadows, Ghost of Yotei). Many complaints dismiss it as \"woke,\" label it as \"Xbox Game Pass slop,\" or criticize it for not living up to Skyrim's standards, lumping it in with genuine trainwrecks like Concord or Suicide Squad. Honestly, that couldn’t be further from the truth.\r\nAvowed’s world is vast and varied, ranging from sprawling ruins and ancient temples to dense forests and bustling settlements. The attention to detail is remarkable, with environmental storytelling woven throughout every location. The visuals are impressive, showcasing some of the best uses of Unreal Engine 5 with dynamic lighting, detailed textures, and impressive weather effects that truly enhance the atmosphere. The performance isn't half bad either, compared to other UE5 titles which are mostly bad in terms of optimization, especially regarding stuttering.\r\nI didn’t go into this expecting a Skyrim clone, nor did I want one. Sure, it doesn’t have the same living, breathing open world or the NPC shenanigans The Elder Scrolls is known for, which most online video comparisons focus on. But where it absolutely shines is in the actual roleplaying: the companions (albeit limited), dialogue choices, exploration, and, without a doubt, the combat. The dialogue system features impactful skill checks that affect how conversations unfold and how you can roleplay your character. What I appreciated too was the in-game lore and explanations provided during dialogue, which helped keep me grounded in the world without needing to consult external sources.\r\nComing fresh from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, this game feels like a natural extension, with a huge emphasis on exploring ruins and wilds, opening hidden passageways, and using parkour. For its limited open world, the exploration is fantastic. Combat in Avowed on the other hand is tactical and engaging. It requires you to pay close attention to positioning, timing, and resource management, especially when using magic or ranged attacks. Unlike many action RPGs that encourage button mashing, Avowed rewards deliberate play and experimentation.\r\nHowever, the loot is underwhelming. Whether it's my build, RNG, or just bad luck, the rewards rarely feel exciting. For my magic-focused build, I’ve found six shields and not a single wand. This tedium almost negates the fun of exploration. Manually looting every single body for scraps is a chore, especially when they are hard to spot. There should be a more streamlined system for this by now.\r\nThe upgrade system is simplified, for better or worse. On the plus side, it allows you to carry a favorite early-game weapon through to the end. While the option to respec is welcome, the high cost discourages experimentation. I would have preferred it to be free.\r\nCombat scaling also feels weird, reminiscent of Skyrim's level-scaling. Despite leveling up, I never felt significantly more powerful, though my resource management did improve. The dialogue includes skill checks, which is a great touch for roleplaying, but their outcomes can feel inconsistent. For example, passing a high-level \"Might\" check might still lead to a fight instead of successfully intimidating an opponent.\r\nAs for the world, I didn't find it confusing. I haven’t played Pillars, but I watched a few \"Before You Play\" videos, which may have helped. The game also includes a feature I love: a button you can press during dialogue to get context on highlighted lore terms, similar to Final Fantasy XVI and Metaphor. It’s a great way to keep players immersed without resorting to heavy-handed exposition.\r\nI would give it a 7/10. It's by no means a bad game, but it feels like a \"filler game\" to me. I would recommend getting it on Game Pass or waiting for a deep sale. Despite its flaws, the game succeeds in creating a rich, atmospheric RPG world. The blend of narrative depth, exploration, and tactical combat kept me invested for over 60 hours.\r\n### Conclusion\r\nAvowed is a solid RPG that shines in exploration, combat, RP-ing, and storytelling, even if it stumbles on loot quality and its not the living breathing open world people want it to be. For players craving a deep, immersive RPG experience with meaningful roleplaying and a richly crafted world, Avowed is well worth your time, especially if you can look past its rougher edges.",

    "body": "The *Battlefield* franchise has always been defined by its signature military sandbox - a large-scale, combined arms experience where infantry, vehicles, and aircraft clash across sprawling maps with destructible environments. The goal is mass chaos, but within a framework of team and objective play. After the disastrous launch of *Battlefield 2042*, the pressure on *Battlefield 6* was immense.\r\n**Pros**\r\n* 🎯 Best-in-Class Gunplay: Excellent, weighty gunfeel with good TTK (Time to Kill)\r\n* 🏃 Fluid Movement and Great implementation of modern movement mechanics (sliding, crouch sprinting) without becoming overly twitchy.\r\n* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Successful return to the classic Class system, correcting the mistakes of its predecessor.\r\n* 💣 Visceral Atmosphere: The \"War Atmosphere\", sound design, and special effects are the most intense DICE has ever delivered.\r\n* ✨ Insanely optimized and achieves high visual fidelity and frame rates with traditional rasterization methods, running smoothly with modest hardware requirements.\r\n* 🎧 War Tapes V.A.L.: Enhanced audio mix creates an unparalleled, gritty soundscape.\r\nCons\r\n* 🗺️ Awful Map Design: Maps are too small, poorly balanced, and chaotic, creating constant exposure with no breathing room.\r\n* 🚗 Worst Vehicle Experience: Small maps and missing features severely limit vehicle effectiveness and fun.\r\n* 📅 Broken Challenges: Initially ridiculous and poorly tracking challenges hampered early progression (though being patched).\r\n* 📉 Feature Stagnation: Lacks the evolutionary leap expected, missing popular features like Levolution and dynamic weather from past titles.\r\nWhat followed was the hardest return I’ve seen in recent years. The series fell hard, but *Battlefield 6* has managed to pull off an undeniable turnaround, leading to one of the biggest selling launches in the franchise's history. It’s a massive comeback, succeeding where its predecessor failed. However, behind that success, *Battlefield 6* still doesn't quite hit the notes required to be considered the ultimate *Battlefield* experience.\r\nIt took me some time before I was able to write a review for this game. I had to play for 60+hrs of multiplayer in a span of two months, leveling up past 50, playing different classes, weapons, vehicles, as well as reminiscing back the good old Battlefield 3 and 4 days to really get a feel of the game and formulate my thoughts on it.\r\n## Pinpoint Gunplay and Fluid Movement\r\nFirst and foremost, the gunplay is good, amazing even. For me, this entry boasts the best gunplay in the series. Weapons feel weighty and satisfying, and the Time-to-Kill (TTK) balancing is spot on. It hits the perfect sweet spot I haven't felt since the days of *Battlefield 3* and *4*, perhaps even better now because back then I had to play at 100-200ms due to our poor country’s internet services. They’ve made the gunplay just right this time, it’s not so long that you’re frustrated watching enemies escape a continuous stream of bullets, but it’s not so short that you have zero fighting chance in a 1v1 where the enemy got the drop on you.\r\nCrucially, excellent gunplay is only going to take you so far if the movement feels clunky, and the good news is that the movement is on par. It never feels like you're fighting against the controls. You move exactly as you intend, and the developers have provided modern, well-implemented options: crouch sprinting, sliding, leaning, and mounting guns. They've fine-tuned these mechanics nicely since the beta, ensuring the movement is responsive without ever devolving into the blazing fast, \"boomer shooter\" feel of a *Call of Duty* title. Although there was a little bit of worry in the beta because people were still bunny hopping around too fast, but the devs have patched it out on release.\r\n## A Well-Defined Class Structure\r\nThe customization of guns is another very well-implemented feature. While the UI can be initially confusing to navigate - it’s not the most user-friendly (in fact, it sucks) - the depth is impressive. There’s a large number of attachments to unlock, providing a constant sense of progression. Earning a new foregrip, suppressor, scope, or extended mag size all contributes to making your chosen weapons feel slightly more competitive and enjoyable to play. The early grinding to unlock these attachments was atrocious in the first two weeks, but they patched it out soon after, making the progression feel much more natural and rewarding.\r\nAs for the soldier classes, they are in the best state ever amongst all the *Battlefield* games, thankfully moving away from the disastrous operator systems seen in *Battlefield 2042*. I find myself equally using all four classes because they are all viable and unique:\r\n* Assault is fun with the crucial spawn beacon, allowing constant, effective flank and capture support. Its signature gadget the Adrenaline Injector sucks, but the spawn beacon and ladder makes up for it.\r\n* Engineer is the competitive choice against the game's heavy armor and air threats, or if you prefer to pilot yourself to get bonuses for your vehicle.\r\n* Support is the backbone of the team, equipped to handle revive, health, ammo, and even cover via a shield. It has everything to keep it going.\r\n* Recon is surprisingly fun, allowing you to dominate the leaderboards with single-digit kills purely through spotting and flanking with the drone, before switching to sniping if the situation demands.\r\n## Visceral War Atmosphere and Destruction\r\nOne of the most important parts of the *Battlefield* franchise, especially since its transition to the Frostbite engine, is the \"War Atmosphere\" and the Destructible Environments. I can confidently say they turned it up a notch here this time. The sheer volume of special effects is incredible: more explosions, more camera shake, and more intense particle effects that add a palpable weight to all the chaos. It feels like DICE’s most intense war atmosphere to date among the games it has made.\r\nThe visuals themselves are nothing short of amazing. The game looks great and achieves its modernity by using traditional raster methods, focusing on a higher level of fidelity, detailed models, crisp textures, and a weighty atmosphere. When that chopper is going down, or when an apartment floor is collapsing, or when a tank is fuming flames ready to explode, that's *Battlefield* looking at its best.\r\nHowever, the destruction is still quite limited and state-based. It isn’t dynamically freeing like in games where you can level an entire building floor-by-floor, nor does it offer the systemic freedom of *Bad Company 2* where you could essentially wipe the entire map clean. Despite this limitation, *Battlefield 6* is still near the top when it comes to visual destruction spectacles. It still doesn’t beat *The Finals* when it comes to really dynamic and cool looking destructible environments.\r\n## Audio and Technical Masterclass\r\nThe sound quality, as usual, is best in class for a war game thanks to the enhanced audio options. Specifically, the game features the enhanced 'War Tapes V.A.L. (Very Aggressive Listening)' setting. This is a special audio mix that compresses the dynamic range and adds distortion to create an incredibly intense, visceral soundscape—tank engines rumbling, explosions ringing in your ears, and heavy gunfire crackling all around you.\r\nIt delivers a raw, impactful feeling. However, if you need precise directional audio for competitive play or want to hear enemy footsteps clearly, settings like High Dynamics or the default mix are better choices. War Tapes is for immersion first.\r\nI must also note that the game is ultra-optimized. It achieves this level of fidelity without taxing the hardware, running smoothly on systems far lower than the usual modern AAA requirement. I found I didn't need upscaling technology like DLSS to push my frame rates past 100, which is a rare feat in today's market.\r\n## The Caveats\r\nDespite all these triumphs, the game’s score is held back by critical, fundamental flaws in design.\r\nFirstly, the maps are terribly balanced and too small, even the large Conquest ones. There are simply too many flanks, entry ways, and rooftops, leading to chaotic, unfun mess rather than strategic engagements. There is no breathing room; you see enemies everywhere, in every direction, even if you just try to capture a far away point. The spawns are too close and too easily visible by the enemy on the other side of the maps. The map design has seemingly over-corrected the issues of *2042 (which had the maps too big)*, but the result is that there are no viable play styles other than fast flanking or sitting on an unreachable roof. The objectives are so tiny and lanes are so close that every fight feels identical.\r\nThis issue is compounded by the fact that for vehicles, this is probably the worst *Battlefield* up to this point. Small maps mean aircraft constantly hit the outside combat zone warning (You’ll be surprised at how small the combat zone for aircraft is, even given the small map size) There are missing features like the Little Bird and a complete absence of jet unlocks. The limited map space simply doesn't allow for the tactical vehicle play the series is known for.\r\nFinally, while the classes are great, the initial challenge system was a serious failure. The challenges were initially ridiculous, some were broken, and others were poorly worded. Tasks like \"Get 10 takedowns (melee) in a single match\" or \"3000 vehicle repairs in a single life\" seemed impossible in a normal organically game without luck or cheesing. The good news is the developers have acknowledged this and are actively patching them, but it was a frustrating hurdle during the launch window.\r\n## **Conclusion**\r\n*Battlefield 6* is a technical marvel in terms of gunplay and optimization, and a successful return to form thanks to its class system. However, it feels like a step backward in some key ways, lacking features like fortification, dynamic weather and *Levolution* (Events that changed the entire map, like a Dam breaking or a Skyscraper collapsing) that made older titles feel evolutionary. More importantly, the core map design actively works against the series' strengths, limiting tactical freedom.\r\nIt is a game built on the best core mechanics *Battlefield* has ever produced, but those mechanics are frequently suffocated by the environments they are contained within. My score falls short of 8, At 7.8/10, it is an excellent military shooter, but still not the ultimate *Battlefield* experience I had hoped for.",

    "body": "**Clair Obscur: Expedition 33** takes the turn-based RPG genre to new heights by blending traditional tactical combat with real-time elements and an engrossing narrative. It stands out with its ambitious story, strong voice acting, and captivating soundtrack.\r\n## Pros\r\n* 🎤 High-quality voice acting that brings characters to life * 🧙‍♂️ Innovative combat system mixing turn-based and real-time mechanics * 📖 Deep lore and story that hooks players with rich world-building * 🎼 Excellent soundtrack that enhances atmosphere and mood * 🌌 Unique indie charm with thoughtful design and presentation ## Cons\r\n* 🕹️ Overworld and level exploration and interaction feel clunky and unpolished * ⚔️ Combat initiation can be abrupt and sometimes frustrating * 🖥️ UI and controls need refinement for smoother gameplay The game’s story and lore are its strongest assets, pulling players into a richly imagined world full of total mystery and intrigue. The story is unlike anything I've experienced before. The narrative layers multiple plot threads, character arcs, and world history that unravels gradually, rewarding players who invest time into exploration and dialogue, and playing with your emotions in ways you cannot even imagine.\r\nThe combat offers a refreshing twist by combining the deliberate tactics of turn-based battles with bursts of real-time action. This hybrid system keeps fights engaging and unpredictable, requiring both strategic planning and quick reflexes. You’ll manage a party with diverse skills, timing your moves and use of skills carefully to maximize effectiveness. Each encounter challenges you to balance offense, defense, and crowd control, and the different resource systems unique to each characters, while positioning and timing (parrying, dodging, etc) remain crucial for success. For the majority of the game, you can freely change your three-person party composition anywhere outside of combat. This allows you to adapt to changing battle conditions, exploit enemy weaknesses, and experiment with different builds without being locked into one role. It adds a layer of strategic depth that is usually seen in turn-based games, encouraging creativity and thoughtful planning. All playable characters are well-balanced and handled in a very unique way. They aren't your typical mage, warrior, or rogue archetypes but something much more special, to the point that you'll need to take time to read their different skills and effects to understand each character's intended playstyle. Although at only 5-6 characters, its a bit on the low side in terms of total party members.\r\nOutside of combat, exploration and narrative progression intertwine smoothly. The game really has that \"Expedition\" vibes as they presented with the title. The world is richly detailed with lore and story threads from previous Expeditions that reward attention and curiosity.\r\nThe actual Exploration in terms of game mechanics in the levels and the grandier overworld, however, is less refined. Moving through the levels and interacting with objects can feel awkward, which sometimes interrupts immersion. Combat initiation mechanics also occasionally disrupt pacing, as battles can be awkward to trigger.\r\nSemi puzzle elements and a small handful of side quests and interactibles intersperse battles, providing variety and moments of respite, without the game feeling overcrowded. The game’s UI and controls, while generally effective, occasionally feel a bit clunky, but they don’t significantly detract from the overall experience.\r\n</div>",

    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "There has been a lot of discourse about Cyberpunk 2077, one of the biggest games to come out in the last five years, and one that has seen its own share of controversies and backlash from its poorly received launch until the developers slowly fixed their game over time to what it is today. I waited patiently until the game was adequately patched up, and then waited even more. I wanted to experience it with the hardware ready to run it at full path tracing (something that was only added post-release) and enough free time to give it the attention it deserves.\r\nThe stars finally lined up, and I was able to play Cyberpunk 2077 almost five years after its release. Honestly, I didn’t even know what to expect. My hype and expectations for the game have been on a rollercoaster these past few years, but I can honestly say the experience of playing it for the first time in 2025 was still beyond what I expected, given its history.\r\n### Pros\r\n* 🖋️The storytelling feels premium and really rivals the best books, movies, or games out there.\r\n* 🏙️ The world-building and quest design is incredibly detailed, making Night City feel alive and believable. * ❤️Side quest content is absolutely on par with the quality of the main quest.\r\n* 🎭 The performances, especially by Keanu Reeves, are breathtaking, adding a lot of depth to the story. * 🎮 The gameplay offers impressive variety and player choice, making the gameplay even more immersive on top of the story and roleplaying mechanics.\r\n* 🌟  With path tracing on, the visuals are some of the most photorealistic and stunning I’ve ever seen.\r\n### Cons\r\n* 🐞 A few engine quirks and bugs still punctuate an otherwise smooth experience. * 🚗 Driving in first person is practically unplayable, making third-person a necessity. ### A Consistently 'Preem' Experience All Around\r\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition includes Phantom Liberty, which is an expansion that adds a sizeable middle chapter to the story. Right from the start, I have to say Phantom Liberty’s content is much better and more refined than the main quest, but the main game still stands strong on its own.\r\nJumping in, the first thing that stands out is just how consistently premium 'preem' the storytelling feels across the board. The story is crafted at a level you rarely see, the kind of writing and world-building usually reserved for the very best books, movies, or games out there. Night City is truly out of this world. There is so much depth, atmosphere, and detail in every mission and interaction, every single quest, side mission, and even random gig feels like it had real care and attention.\r\nIn other games, there's the main quest and the side quests, and the side quests are usually filler content, full of padding and often forgettable or boring. In Cyberpunk 2077, though, both the main quest and side quests are on par in terms of quality and design; you’d think that everything is part of the main quest. It compels you to just keep questing and questing, doing every single thing in the game because everything feels genuinely high-quality, from the support character questlines to even simple “Odd Jobs” side quests that you might stumble upon while roaming around. Then there’s the actual “filler content” called Gigs, but even as the third or fourth-rate option, they’re still very compelling and never boring.\r\nThe developers went far beyond the basics, putting effort into even minor flavor like text messages, emails, video calls, and even dynamic loading screens at the start of every session, that shift depending on your progress and the world’s current events. ### Breathtaking Performance\r\nThe cast performance is stellar, with performances that are nothing short of breathtaking. Keanu Reeves leads the pack, and it’s insane to think that he has more dialogue here than in most of his movies, especially in his John Wick films, imagine the sheer volume of lines for a role like this, and it shows in the game’s emotional punch. The rest of the cast matches this energy, bringing Night City’s citizens to life in a way that makes even brief encounters memorable.\r\n### Your Choices REALLY Matter\r\nThe gunplay and overall gameplay surprised me. Compared to many RPG shooter games that can feel floaty or disconnected, Cyberpunk 2077 delivers combat with real weight and variety. You get a ridiculous amount of freedom in how you approach every mission, whether going loud with heavy hitters like a shotgun, ARs, powerful revolver, or using silenced weapons, or even high-tech weaponry with auto-targeting mechanisms. Maybe you don’t want to fight at all and prefer hacking your way through or sneaking past enemies. That said, the progression tree is not the most compelling; some of the most attractive perks, in my opinion, are buried deep behind others you may not care for. Despite the ability to respec, the skill point requirements to access higher-tier perks make experimenting with new playstyles tough unless you commit a lot of points.\r\nThe game is almost entirely in first person, which adds to the immersion, except for the driving, which is playable in third person. And you know why? It’s because the first person driving sucks, it just doesn’t work. The angle is too low, the FOV is too narrow, there are no functional mirrors to use, and the camera just shakes and deviates too much from what’s ahead of the vehicle.\r\nRoleplaying-wise,  one of the game’s strongest points is the impact of your choices. Both the main story and Phantom Liberty branch into multiple, truly 100% different outcomes, far more than just a final cutscene or slightly different epilogue scene. Entire late-game sections completely change depending on what you do, which brings a rare sense of consequence and immersion but also means certain characters WILL be underdeveloped depending on your path. To see every layer of the story and the characters, multiple playthroughs are essentially required. That said, when it comes to roleplaying “skill checks”, I felt the game was still lacking. There are only a limited number of meaningful skill checks throughout the whole playthrough, and most of my skills didn’t feel very useful or impactful regardless if I leveled them or not. ### The Best Of The Best In Graphics\r\nVisually, especially with path tracing mode enabled, Cyberpunk 2077 is about as beautiful as games come, even for a five year old game (path tracing mode was added post release, though). The lighting difference in path tracing versus regular ray tracing or no ray tracing is huge, and especially at night and with the proper HDR/brightness configuration, the visuals transforms into something almost photorealistic. There are quirks, though: for all the impressive environments and lighting, character models can still look plasticky or off at times, breaking a bit of the immersion. And while performance is far better than at launch, a bit of the signature jank and rough edges from the engine are still around, expect the occasional physics bug or odd questing logic moment that reminds you it’s a sprawling open-world beast.\r\n### Conclusion\r\nAfter almost five years of wild ups and downs, major and minor patches, and a full-blown expansion, Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition delivered for me an experience that feels worthy of its hype five years ago. When everything comes together, it’s a must-play RPG and a technical showcase, filled with moments of storytelling and world-building that live up to the game's ambitions. There are still some rough spots, but the sheer quality of the narrative, the breathtaking city, the performances, and how truly different your story can turn out make this the best time to lose yourself in Night City.",

    "body": "**Death Stranding 2** picks up the thread of its predecessor, expanding upon the contemplative, atmospheric journey that divided opinion when the first game released back in 2019 but still stands out for its unique vision, even more so now that the sequel has released. It takes everything that worked and refines it, delivering a game that is as much about emotional connection and storytelling as it is about traversal and survival.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🎵 An epic and haunting soundtrack that deeply enhances the emotional impact - 🗺️ Vast and meticulously crafted open world that rewards exploration and patience - 🚶 A bold design choice to minimize fast travel, emphasizing the journey itself - 🕹️ Polished traversal and vehicle mechanics that add depth and variety - 🎭 Rich narrative with a star-studded cast and complex character development ## Cons\r\n- ⚖️ Gameplay difficulty reduced from the first, less challenging for veterans - 🔄 Frequent vehicle use sometimes diminishes the challenge of terrain traversal The core mechanic of Death Stranding 2 is about moving across varied and often treacherous but immensely cathartically beautiful terrain, using a range of vehicles and tools to navigate mountains, rivers, and obstacles. The idea that this game is a \"Walking Simulator\" is a complete and total misnomer that stems from a misunderstanding of its gameplay. While traversal is the main focus, that's precisely what sets this game apart from everything else. It's truly an experience you have to play to believe.\r\nThe traversal mechanics have seen significant improvements from the first game. Not all of them I liked, but I think its for the better. Players have a variety of vehicles and methodsat their disposal — a tri-cruise, a four wheel truck, a surfboard, and many more that you will discover when playing — allowing more dynamic movement across varied terrain. Yet, the game retains the challenge of negotiating difficult landscapes on foot, requiring thoughtful navigation, balance, and resource management. I love the feeling of traveling in this game. Unlike other titles where I would just follow a waypoint and beeline from point A to B without thinking, here the journey itself is the fun. The process is methodical and tactical: constantly scanning the terrain to find the safest path, checking the map for elevation changes, and carefully managing the weight of your cargo along with the equipment you need. It’s all part of a delivering a satisfying gameplay loop.\r\nThis philosophy is reinforced by a host of brilliantly weird mechanics that are tailored specifically to this experience. The \"Strand System,\" for example, is a unique form of asymmetric social multiplayer. What other game lets you send \"Likes\" to another player's perfectly placed ladder that helped you, which in turn makes more of their helpful structures appear in your game? This creates a compelling social loop where you are also motivated to build something useful in a clever spot just to earn Likes from others. These mechanics blend seamlessly with the environmental storytelling, making every journey feel personal and reflective.\r\nThe narrative remains a major selling point and only bolsters the strong quality offering of the game in literally all fronts. Boasting a star-studded cast that brings gravitas and nuance to an already complex script. Sprinkled with that trademark Hideo Kojima weirdness going on that only he can pull off. The story explores themes of connection, isolation, and the human condition in a fragmented world, continuing Kojima’s tradition of cinematic storytelling filled with mystery and emotional depth.\r\nAlthough some players, especially first game veterans, might find the gameplay easier this time around - which could lessen the sense of accomplishment. However the trade off is the gains in accessibility, the game is now easier and the pacing is better, you get a vehicle pretty early in the story, making it more inviting to newcomers. Another thing that has significantly improved over the first game is the combat, as combat is now more frequent and intense, relying on a combination of a plethora of firearms, tools, and gadgets. When confronted by hostile entities or supernatural threats, players could rely on stealth, or use brute force firepower. Kinda some ways, it feels similar to MGSV with regards to the combat system, gunplay included. The delivery system is directly tied to the progression system and you get access to more equipment by delivering more cargo.\r\nThe game is a feast not just for the eyes, but for the ears as well as the music is absolutely fire. A big part of its unique atmosphere comes from its use of licensed, real-world music rather than a traditional orchestral score composed specifically for the game. This approach grounds the experience in a tangible reality, creating moments of startling beauty and reflection. In my opinion, I think more games and developers should explore using licensed tracks, even if licensing is difficult, as it can forge a powerful and distinct emotional connection that a conventional soundtrack sometimes can't.\r\n</div>",

    "body": "**Disco Elysium: The Final Cut** is a unique and extraordinary RPG experience that defies many conventions. It delivers an intensely narrative-driven game where dialogue and player choice replace traditional combat mechanics, making it one of the most memorable role-playing games in recent years.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🗣️ Exceptional writing with witty, profound, and often legitimately hilarious dialogue - 🧠 Deep character systems including talking skills and Thought Cabinet mechanics - 🎭 Rich, immersive world with distinct characters and complex social dynamics - 🎨 Distinctive art style that perfectly complements the tone and setting ## Cons\r\n- 📚 Heavy reliance on text and dialogue may overwhelm players not used to extensive reading - 🕹️ Gameplay lacks traditional combat and can feel static to some players - 🚪 The game’s ending kind of falls flat\r\nThe game immerses you in a rich world filled with an expansive history and lore, unique characters, dark humor, and philosophical musings. The writing is exceptional, witty, profound, and often hilariously absurd—balancing bleak social commentary with moments of genuine human connection. Every conversation feels meaningful, with countless branching dialogue options shaped by your detective’s personality traits and internal conflicts.\r\n</div>\r\nGraphically, the game adopts a painterly style that feels both surreal and grounded. The city of Revachol feels alive and broken, with hand-painted environments that echo the narrative’s themes of decay and despair. This visual aesthetic enhances the game's moody atmosphere and complements its themes of decay and political unrest. It looks particularly good and I would say timeless.\r\nExploration is rewarding; the world is filled with hidden lore, side quests, and interactive objects that deepen the story and encourage curiosity.  It's a point-and-click game for keyboard and mouse players, but the game adopts a different control scheme for controller users by letting you control character movement directly. However, the experience is quite clunky, especially the pathfinding when interacting with the environment and characters. Its point-and-click nature still shows.\r\nDue  to the sheer volume of text and dialogue even in the most simplest forms of action in the game, the narrative can be overwhelming , which might not appeal to players who prefer faster-paced gameplay. This is even more evident in the original release which was only sparsely voice-acted, requiring players to read most dialogue. However, the 'Final Cut' now features a complete voice-over.\r\nWhile the plot itself is a conventional murder mystery and not especially unique, the game's true brilliance lies in its execution. The minute-to-minute delivery of the characters' thoughts and dialogue elevates the simple premise into something profound and substantial. This momentum carries through until the ending, which unfortunately falls flat in my opinion (the last five minutes). Nevertheless, it remains a uniquely great experience overall.\r\n</div>",

    "description": "How is it possible that a short game like Dispatch is this",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "How is it possible that a short game like **Dispatch** is this jam-packed with absolutely cool, hilarious, and outright epic moments? A lot of “short” narrative games feel like extended demos or proof-of-concept experiments. **Dispatch** feels like a short but fully realized eight-episode season that just happens to be interactive.\r\n🎬 Pros\r\n* Relentless pacing from Episode 1–8 with zero filler.\r\n* Legit funny writing where the jokes actually land.\r\n* Stellar cast of YouTubers, streamers, and actors that absolutely sell every scene.\r\n* Great character arcs that flip clichés on their head, or not. It’s unpredictable.\r\n* Engaging choices and “dispatch” gameplay that keep you involved moment to moment.\r\n💔 Cons\r\n* The overall 'big-picture' story stays mostly the same no matter what you pick, some choices feel more like flavor than full-on branching paths.\r\n## **A Short Game That Hits Way Too Hard**\r\nFrom Episode 1 all the way to Episode 8,  Dispatch just does not miss. The jokes land. The timing is sharp. The action is so fun to watch that you genuinely forget you’re \"playing a game\" and not just binging a wild TV series. Then it reminds you that yes, you actually have some control here (sometimes even forgetting that I need to pick up the controller) - all just enough for your decisions and the “Dispatch” side of things to matter without bogging you down in complicated gameplay mechanics. **Dispatch** hits that sweet spot where gameplay and narrative don’t compete; they feed into each other. Instead of taking you out of the narrative when the gameplay happens and vice versa.\r\nTo be honest, **Dispatch** is barely a video game in a traditional sense, It often feels more like a highly interactive TV series that borders on being a game. Yet, if its stellar execution earned it a Game of the Year nomination, I wouldn't complain, because it delivers a great gaming experience nonetheless.\r\n## **The \"Dispatch\" in Dispatch**\r\nEvery episode, there is a segment wherein you will perform your job as a ‘Dispatcher’. You act as the handler for your squad of misfit superheroes, fielding emergency calls and deciding which hero to deploy based on their specific stats - Combat, Vigor, Intellect, Charisma, and Mobility. it’s about logic and consequences. If you send a hero with max Combat but zero Charisma to a delicate hostage negotiation, they might \"solve\" the problem by punching everyone, causing massive collateral damage. You have to juggle cooldowns as heroes get tied up on missions, forcing you to rely on your other heroes even if there is a mismatch on the stats, when things get hairy. It’s a perfect layer of strategy that makes you feel responsible for the chaos on screen without bogging down the story in spreadsheets.\r\nThe gameplay loop is surprisingly engaging for what could have been a simple menu screen. After your shift ends, the story continues via cutscenes with the player choosing different dialogue options to progress, the game seamlessly transitions from management sim to an interactive drama.\r\nThere is also a hacking mini-game for you to personally help the heroes in some instances, that serves as a nice palate cleanser, breaking up the menu-management loop just enough to keep things from feeling repetitive.\r\n## **A Cast That Shouldn’t Work, But Totally Does**\r\nOne of Dispatch’s biggest strengths is its cast. On paper, it sounds chaotic: a mix of YouTubers, content creators, and traditional actors all thrown together. In practice, that blend gives the game a weirdly authentic energy. It feels like people you might actually follow online got dropped into a high-stakes narrative.\r\nSeeing heavy hitters like Aaron Paul (*Breaking Bad*) and Jeffrey Wright (*The Batman*) trade lines with internet icons like MoistCr1TiKaL and Jacksepticeye creates a surreal but perfect dynamic. The unique mix pays off instantly. The performances work because the writing backs them up. Characters are well written and surprisingly relatable, each with their own flaws and quirks. Even with the game’s short runtime, it does a great job of making you feel attached to this weird little team. You only spend a handful of episodes with them, but it’s enough to care.\r\nThe character development is also surprisingly well done. Some characters start off feeling insufferable or painfully cliché, the kind you think you’ve seen a thousand times before. Then the game slowly peels back layers, and suddenly they’re not so one-note. In several cases, Dispatch sets you up to think, “Oh, this guy is *obviously* going to do X,” and then it completely flips the script. Sometimes you’d think they’d flip the script, but to only end up not doing it. That subversion of expectations keeps the story fresh even when you’re sure you’ve figured it out. It’s not that predictable.\r\n## **Choices That Matter… Just Not How You Think**\r\nDispatch does involve choice, but not in the “every decision creates a new universe” kind of way. If you go in expecting a sprawling tree of wildly different endings and outcomes, that’s not what this is.\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, the overall story path is still quite similar no matter what you do. Core events will still happen. Certain beats are locked in. You are not rewriting the entire narrative from scratch.\r\nBut that doesn’t mean your decisions are meaningless. Far from it.\r\n* Many dialogue choices change the immediate tone and content of conversations.\r\n* Bigger “action choices” can trigger more significant, sometimes gameplay-altering outcomes.\r\n* Some major decisions can unlock unique footage or swap a character or two in certain story beats.\r\nSo while the skeleton of the story stays the same, the meat on the bones changes depending on how you play. And honestly, that approach fits the game’s structure. Not every game needs a hundred endings and flowcharts that look like conspiracy boards. Dispatch focuses on telling one strong story with some meaningful variations, and that’s a valid design choice that pays off with the quality it was delivered in.\r\nI have just one big personal gripe: the best female hero (in my opinion) on the team is not romanceable, and it stings.\r\nWhen a game does such a good job making you care about its cast, it’s natural to want more ways to connect with them. Dispatch clearly knows how to write charming, layered characters, so when your favorite female hero ends up being completely off-limits romantically, it feels like a missed opportunity.\r\nEven without a second playthrough yet, Dispatch has that rare quality where you finish it and immediately think, “Okay, but what if I’d done that other thing instead?” The plan for another run is already brewing, not because the ending felt incomplete, but because it feels like there are more angles worth seeing, not a totally different story, just the different reactions, different combinations of scenes, maybe a few new surprises.\r\n## **Conclusion**\r\nFor a short, episode-based game, Dispatch manages to feel surprisingly full. The pacing is tight, the writing is sharp, the performances are on point, and the choices, while not universe-shattering, still feel impactful enough in the moment. It’s the kind of game that respects your time but still gives you plenty to chew on.\r\nIf you want something that plays like an interactive TV season - with great jokes, strong characters, and just enough agency to make you sweat your choices - Dispatch is absolutely binge-worthy your time. I only clocked in at about 8 or so hours for a single playthrough, so its quite playable in a couple of sittings if not one.",

    "body": "**Doom: Dark Ages** delivers a fast-paced, satisfying shooter experience that captures the spirit of the franchise while streamlining some gameplay elements. It’s the Doom game I enjoyed the most among recent titles, striking a balance between classic intensity and modern design.\r\n## Pros\r\n- ⚡ Ultra-fast loading times that keep gameplay flowing - 🔥 Smooth and polished combat flow reminiscent of classic Doom - 🛡️ Strong enemy and level design with tight, compact encounters - 🎯 Streamlined weapon management that keeps focus on action - 💥 Gore and enemy variety that maintain the series’ brutal charm ## Cons\r\n- 🎨 Graphics are simplified, with some textures feeling low-quality - 😐 Human character models and faces look cartoonish, breaking immersion - 🕹️ Lack of advanced platforming reduces vertical gameplay complexity From the outset, the game wastes no time throwing players into relentless battles against hordes of demons. as you’re greeted with combat that feels fluid and exhilarating. The flow of switching between weapons and engaging enemies is smoother than in Doom Eternal, with less fuss and more immediacy. No more switching to the chainsaw just because you needed more ammo, or having to use the flamethrower to get more armor, or having to use widely different weapon types because enemies have hard weakness or defense to specific types. Here in Dark Ages, the combat feels fast but approachable, without the complexity and weapon juggling that some players find tedious. All weapons are effective against all enemies, with only minor differences in efficiency. Ultimately, it all boils down to how you want to have fun,\r\nLevel design is tight and semi-open, offering enough exploration without feeling bloated or directionless. The encounters balance large enemy hordes with strategic opportunities to utilize different combat styles and weapon stances. While maps are compact and focused, they’re packed with secrets, alternate paths, and hidden caches that reward thorough exploration that doesn't feel tedious or a chore to do. It just came naturally for me to explore these extra areas.\r\nThe enemy variety is classic Doom, with familiar demons returning alongside some new threats. Each enemy type requires different tactics, but as I've said, are all within killable means with every weapon. and The game's roster of weapons is interesting and fun to use, and I found myself switching between them by choice, not because the game forced me to for a mechanical advantage. The game's pivot to a medieval theme is one of its greatest strengths. Far from being a negative, it serves as a refreshing departure from the series' traditional sci-fi backdrop, while still cleverly integrating the futuristic elements fans expect. And it's not like they shifted to Medieval out of nowhere, as they already have shown some medieval elements in the previous two games anyway.\r\nWith regards to the platforming, in which I absolutely hated in Doom: Eternal, it is now toned down here and designed way better, they made the the experience feel more straightforward, accessible, and the movements are faster and easier, focusing on pure combat rather than navigation challenges. Overall, the game’s platforming is well tuned, offering challenges that reward mastery without becoming frustrating. Graphically, Doom: Dark Ages doesn't look much different but the previous two Doom titles, but it does consume significantly more resources because of the forced RT. Despite of that harsher but still reasonable requirements, some textures and character models still feels dated compared to modern shooters or even contemporaries in the same engine like Wolfenstein II or Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Although, this stylistic choice complements the fast gameplay and nostalgic vibe anyway. While the game maintains Doom’s trademark gore and demon designs, the human characters and faces fall short, giving off a cartoonish vibe that detracts from the otherwise gritty atmosphere. The sound design is punchy and atmospheric, with iconic weapon sounds and the usual heavy metal soundtrack that fuel the game’s intensity.\r\n</div>",

    "category": "review",
    "body": "**Dragon Age: The Veilguard** has been at the center of intense discussion since its launch, with much of the controversy stemming from its art style and perceived emphasis on diversity. However, beneath the noise lies a substantial RPG experience that builds on the legacy of the franchise with bold gameplay and storytelling choices.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🎮 Action-oriented combat with God of War-style mechanics - 📜 Strong quest structure with clear waypointing and side content - 🌆 Clever level design balancing open-world exploration and linear progression - 🎙️ Engaging storytelling with notable narration by Varric - 🔄 Convenient fast travel system enhancing exploration flow - 📜 A surprisingly satisfying ending that is the culmination of all the stories of the previous games\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🎭 Art style and character designs sparked divisive opinions - 🗺️ Quest bloat with many filler quests that can feel repetitive - 🐞 Some reused maps for multiple quests reducing variety From the outset, Veilguard adopts a more action-oriented combat system reminiscent of games like God of War or even Bioware's own title: Mass Effect, a notable departure from the real-time pausable tactical angle of earlier Dragon Age titles. Sure, I miss the Dragon Age: Origins style of tactical play, which is much closer to Baldur's Gate 3 than the current Witcher 3 or God of War-style combat. But then again, the signs that BioWare wanted a more action-packed, real-time game were there as far back as Dragon Age 2. They've just gone all-in now, and I don't mind the change. It's a familiar transition for long-time RPG fans, similar to the shift from Fallout 2 to Fallout 3 or the evolution of the Final Fantasy series.\r\nThe combat was a lot of fun—action-packed, intense, and truly real-time. However, over the course of a 50+ hour experience, it began to feel repetitive and lacking in options. Having only three skill slots is far too limiting, and the skill tree feels restrictive, lacking variety and impactful abilities. While respecs are free, the entire skill system should have offered more to experiment with.\r\nThe game primarily follows a more linear progression compared to previous entries, guiding players through a focused storyline packed with cinematic moments and meaningful choices. However, scattered throughout are pockets of semi-open areas ripe for exploration, where players can hunt for loot, uncover secrets, and complete side quests that deepen world-building and character development.\r\nThe quest structure, waypointing, and how objectives appear on the map were done very well. You can see other side quests on the map / minimap / compass even if you're not actively tracking them, which is a huge help for multitasking. The level design is probably the best in the series. The environments are a fantastic middle ground between open-world and linear, the locations are incredibly varied, and the smart use of verticality truly shines, especially now that they've finally added a jump button.\r\nThe art style change was a bit jarring at first. The cartoonish character proportions and faces felt strange, but the effect wasn't as substantial as I expected. The change was likely amplified by the new setting—the culture and architecture in Tevinter are naturally different. I noticed this when I got to the Deep Roads, a location from the first game. Things suddenly started to look familiar, and it proved the style hadn't changed that much after all.\r\nWhere the game takes a massive step back, in my opinion, is the roleplaying. The dialogue system has been heavily toned down, a trend that has continued with each game. There are no more skill checks in conversations, very few alternate outcomes, and no \"evil\" or \"asshole\" choices like in Origins or the Mass Effect games. This is something I hope BioWare improves in the future.\r\nThe main quest, however, is where the game truly excels. The core story and the major plotlines involving factions and characters (when they aren't filler) are incredibly well-made and will compel you to keep playing. I had goosebumps and hyped moments constantly, especially during the epic boss fights. This was no doubt amplified by my 15-year investment in the series. As for the resolution to the whole saga? I am very satisfied with how the story unfolded. It was an epic experience. The main companion quests were also interesting and larger-than-life, so much so that it often felt like I was playing multiple main quests simultaneously. In fact, if you were that invested in the series starting from the first one up to Dragon Age: Inquisition, playing this one up to the very end is worth it, and the ending absolutely pays off. They pulled off a surprisingly satisfying ending in this one, guys.\r\nWhile Veilguard does stumble on some fronts — including the art style controversy and quest repetition — it still delivers a compelling, immersive RPG experience with enough depth and charm to satisfy fans.\r\n</div>",

    "description": "Dragon's Dogma II is a highly anticipated sequel with unique party and combat mechanics but suffers from severe optimization issues, rushed story pacing, and technical drawbacks.",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "## A personal favorite finally gets a long awaited sequel\r\nThe first Dragon's Dogma was one of my all-time favorite RPGs, especially for its engaging combat and unique mechanics. So when the second game was announced, I was beyond excited, pre-ordering it without hesitation - a very rare move for me. But unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment due to VERY severe optimization issues that made it nearly unplayable. Even after upgrading my aging CPU, FPS drops and frame spikes persisted, forcing me to set the game aside about halfway through the story. The game was shelved for MONTHS. I tried multiple times to return, even resorting to mods like Frame Gen to improve performance, but the mod was crashing until recently, when I finally managed to get a somewhat steady 100+ FPS with minor drops, allowing a smoother experience overall without crashing. So now, here comes the game.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique mechanics including the pawn system, allowing creation of a secondary character called a pawn - Ability to recruit pawns from other players, offering a form of asynchronous multiplayer - Lively companion chatter with dialogue for every occasion, making companions feel alive - Satisfying combat featuring monster-climbing mechanics and visually striking animations - Diverse combat skills spanning across 10 classes, each fun to play - Quest setup encourages player independence and creative problem solving ## Cons\r\n- Rushed plot with disjointed pacing, underdeveloped characters, and incoherent story arcs - Major characters and locations felt underutilized and forgotten mid-story - Performance issues with frame drops, clunky animations, and screen-door visual effects - Poor shadowing and lighting quality highlight RE Engine limitations in open worlds - Hardcore fast travel and checkpoint mechanics causing frustrating progress loss - Heavy reliance on mods for improved performance and quality-of-life improvements </div>\r\nCombat is largely satisfying and is probably the best part of this game, with monster-climbing mechanics that add a lot of epicness into the equation, along with intense and visually striking animations and skills that span across 10 classes. Like in Dragon's Dogma 1, each class is fun to play, even magic and archery combat are done right and feels fun to play.\r\nThe quest setup, too, is refreshingly hands-off, giving players a sense of independence as they figure out solutions or navigate the map on their own terms. Whether it's handling an NPC or finding a new route, the game offers a lot of room for improvisation, which is a really great feeling that gives the players a sense of independence --- being able to think a solution for themselves. How you are given multiple possible paths to solve quests, coming up with a weird workaround to a quest and being genuinely surprised that its actually an option were nice aspects that carried over from the first game.\r\n</div>\r\nThe plot eventually becomes more interesting towards last third of the narrative, but it never quite reaches that level of memorability or impact that I was expecting. At a surface level --- especially once you beat it -- the whole narrative gives the impression of being heartfelt, dramatic, profound, and deep, with a really fantastic soundtrack that will invoke these emotions. But the story never really felt that way to me. The game seemed rushed and unfinished, with some things missing that I can't quite put yet. This was also an issue with the first game, which I’d hoped would be addressed this time around by giving it the time and budget it deserved to avoid a similar fate. There were many signs that this game was building up to something bigger in terms of plot, characters, and locations but it never materialized. Be it due to lack of budget, time, or whatever, we will probably never know.\r\n</div>\r\nAlso the game is a little bit too hardcore when it comes to fast travel and navigation options, even for places that you’ve already visited. Especially when this game involves a lot of back and forth-ing between cities/settlements. At some point of the game, I’ve also found 'checkpoints upon dying' a bit too hardcore. I've lost hours of progress in this game, as an intended part of the game’s mechanics (you’ll know it when you experience it).\r\nI ended up relying on various mods to ease the experience: one for fast travel, another for balancing the store and armor systems (a huge step down from the first game which I didn't even talk about), and several quality-of-life improvements. But even then I still lost hours of progress due to the mentioned game mechanic above. The aforementioned frame generation mod was also essential. In fact I would say REQUIRED instead of just being a nice bonus performance like in other games.\r\n</div>",

    "body": "**Final Fantasy VII Rebirth** takes the story in its own unique direction, moving beyond simply retelling the original. It leans heavily into fan service and nostalgia, clearly targeting longtime fans of Final Fantasy VII while also catering to newcomers. For newcomers who’ve only played the Remake, you’re not missing much story-wise, as the trilogy remains largely standalone.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique story direction that doesn’t simply retread the original - Improved combat with smoother animations and better responsiveness - Vast open world maps with adventurous tone eclipsing the original remake - Numerous engaging minigames adding variety - Strong nostalgia and fan service for longtime FF7 fans ## Cons\r\n- Combat still divided in identity; can feel stiff or confusing at times - Performance issues on console with blurry visuals and inconsistent frame rates - Party system limits you to three fighters at once despite larger roaming group - Stealth sections feel minor and somewhat annoying - Visual downgrade in sharpness compared to FF7 Remake on PS5 </div>\r\nAs for the pivotal moments in the original game, Rebirth takes a cautious and somewhat restrained approach but at the same time, the game diverges from the original by exploring these events through new narrative perspectives and thematic mind bending layers, aiming to give players a fresh experience while respecting the significance of these moments. While some fans might find these portrayals less dramatic or way off from their expectations, it fits well within the game’s more modern tone, adding depth and nuance to a well-known story beat without overshadowing the broader narrative.\r\n</div>\r\nThe combat feels improved overall. Animations are smoother, attacks hit with more impact, and responsiveness is significantly better. Yet, the system still struggles with its identity, caught between turn-based and real-time style without really wanting to abandon its turn-based roots fully. This can be jarring or confusing for some players. Stealth sections exist but are small and fairly easy — more of a minor annoyance than a core gameplay feature. Resource gathering and crafting replace the more straightforward “breakable objects” mechanic from the Remake, requiring players to collect materials and ingredients throughout the world. Though this extra step adds engagement and complexity, but it also demands more micromanagement, but its quite managable.\r\nThe world design in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth marks a significant expansion from the more confined urban spaces of the Remake, embracing a semi-open world structure that encourages exploration and discovery of Midgar. The maps are vast and varied, featuring diverse environments that range from dense forests and sprawling settlements to rugged mountains and ancient ruins. Numerous mini-games provide welcome variety although it can get quite tedious if you're a completionist. Overall, the expanded open-world invites thorough exploration with a wealth of side quests and hidden secrets. The campaign offers around 40 hours of content, with over 100 hours available for completionists, making Rebirth a substantial midway point in the Remake saga.\r\n</div>\r\nThe soundtrack of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth masterfully blends orchestral grandeur with nostalgic motifs that pay homage to the original game's soundtrack while forging its own identity as well. Composed with a rich, cinematic quality, the music heightens the emotional impact of key story moments and enhances the atmosphere of each unique environment. In fact, many pivotal beats in the narrative are powerfully carried by the soundtrack, which offers a mix of familiar nostalgia and evocative melodies that deeply move and engage the player’s emotions.\r\n</div>",

    "body": "**Final Fantasy XVI** delivers a dark, complex story far removed from nostalgia, with strong cinematic action, a dynamic combat system that grows over time, and impressive medieval-themed visuals.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Intriguing and deeply complex story with mature themes - Strong motivation to keep playing beyond nostalgia - Impressive and fitting medieval-inspired art style - Over-the-top cinematic cutscenes and action sequences - Dynamic combat system that evolves with new moves and skills ## Cons\r\n- Performance on PS5 is unstable with notable FPS drops - Party system feels underdeveloped and barebones, In fact there's no party at all. - Some combat combos feel repetitive despite variety in skills </div>\r\nThe medieval tone is definitely an acquired taste, and I understand many longtime FF fans might be put off by this, despite Final Fantasy being Medieval originally. After so many futuristic and sci-fi fantasy themes in recent games — including Final Fantasy 7 — going back to medieval times was a polarizing move. But for me, the story in FF16 felt longer, grander, and more epic than the others. Despite having roughly the same tracked playtime, the game felt more epic and grandier. The characters are memorable, and with more exposure through sales and releases on more platforms, I think it could actually become a cult classic.\r\nHonestly, I feel people kind of forgot about this game, but it turned out way better than I expected. I liked it more than FF7 Rebirth, which leans heavily on nostalgia and fan service.\r\n</div>\r\nThe game is very much a solo character experience. The party system feels underdeveloped — almost non-existent — lacking the fleshed-out skills from different characters and classes, combat roles, and character swapping typical of classic Final Fantasy titles or any JRPG game for that matter.\r\nA key feature is the introduction of the powerful Eikon summons that are woven into the very fabric of the experience, serving as much more than simple summons. Narratively, each of these colossal beings is bound to a human Dominant, grounding their god-like power in personal tragedy and political conflict. This connection is brilliantly integrated into gameplay and story, as the protagonist, Clive, absorbs the abilities of the Eikons he defeats. This system creates a tangible link between story progression and player empowerment, as your combat arsenal directly reflects the dramatic journey you've undertaken and the powerful individuals you've encountered.\r\nThis synergy culminates in the game's spectacular Eikon-versus-Eikon battles. These are not just cinematic cutscenes or just QTE sequences but playable, awe-inspiring clashes of immense nuclear scale where you take direct control of a towering deity. Because each battle is the explosive climax of a deeply personal story arc, the impact is immense. This seamless fusion of narrative weight, character growth, and epic, hands-on spectacle is what makes the Eikons an unforgettable and foundational pillar of the entire game.\r\nOutside combat, there is quite a bit of exploration, as the classic Final Fantasy style overworld opens up slowly as you progress the story, unfolding through a series of semi-open areas teeming with secrets, collectibles, and engaging side quests. As said, the game features an overworld that connects these varied regions, allowing players to travel seamlessly between different semi-open zones. This design gives the world a truly expansive feel—large and grand in scale—without ever feeling overcrowded or cramped like in fully open world titles. The deliberate pacing and thoughtful level design create a sense of vastness and freedom, inviting players to immerse themselves in the world’s rich environments at the story's pace.\r\n</div>\r\nThe game is technically well-made in the graphics department, with detailed character models and large, well-crafted environments that look like one big CGI FMV that you'd only sparingly see in the classic Final Fantasy titles. The world feels believable because of the variety in its locations and the quality of the graphics, helping to set the mood in different scenes and complementing the overall serious tone of the plot.\r\n### Performance\r\nPerformance on the PlayStation 5 is inconsistent. The game targets 60fps, but frequent dips occur and never really maintains it, especially during open-world exploration. Combat sequences typically maintain smoother frame rates but rely on aggressive dynamic resolution scaling. I would highly recommend playing the PC version as it offers better performance and visuals in general, but it isn't the best as well in terms of technical optimization.\r\n</div>",

    "category": "review",
    "body": "After primarily gaming on PC for most of the past decade, I finally returned to consoles with a PS5 and Xbox Series X. One of the first games I tackled was **Ghost of Tsushima** — a title I’d missed during the PS4 era but heard so much praise about.\r\n## Pros\r\n- ⚔️ Deep, varied combat styles and stances that keep fights fresh - 🌄 Beautiful, handcrafted open world with immersive atmosphere - 🧩 Meaningful side activities that reward exploration - 🚀 Insanely fast ~3 second fast-travel loading times on PS5 - 🎭 Storytelling with strong narrative quality and emotional depth ## Cons\r\n- 🐴 No auto-pathing or cinematic horse travel like in RDR2 or recent AC games - ⏳ Story pacing is a bit slow at times, unskippable dialogue\r\n- 🤦‍♂️ Some story moments feel unresolved or frustrating (e.g. Ishikawa and Tomoe arc) </div>\r\nWhile the main story is strong, it isn't without its flaws. The plot occasionally relies on tired narrative tropes to move forward, and the motivations of a central figure can feel frustratingly rigid, bound by a code that clashes with the story's more pragmatic themes. Furthermore, some significant side-character arcs build up fascinating moral complexity only to conclude abruptly and fall flat, leaving their compelling questions feeling unresolved. These are minor issues in an otherwise excellent narrative, but they are noticeable blemishes nonetheless.\r\nThe character progression is excellent. The game masterfully compels you to explore its beautiful world by tying side activities directly to meaningful character upgrades. Clearing out Mongol camps, following foxes to hidden shrines, composing haikus, and slicing bamboo all reward you with techniques and legend that make you tangibly more powerful. Unlocking new skills and armor always feels exciting and worthwhile. It never felt like a chore to me. Even when it might look like a Ubisoft/Assassin's Creed RPG title in terms of formula, there is a subtle quality difference and thats what make Ghost of Tsushima stands out.\r\nA key feature of the Director's Cut on PS5 (and eventually, PC) is the insane loading times. I remember talking with a friend about this game, and he casually mentioned reading the tips on the loading screens. I was perplexed because I had never seen anything like that, but I eventually found out that the Director's Cut loads in 1-2 seconds, which basically makes the loading screens obsolete. Fast traveling across the vast map takes a mere 2-3 seconds, a technical marvel that completely changes the pace of exploration. Still, I would have loved a cinematic auto-pathing mode for my horse during long journeys, similar to the feature in Red Dead Redemption 2, to better soak in the stunning scenery.\r\nVisually, the game is renowned for its breathtaking beauty. Colorful, vibrant scenery that showcases the romantic beauty of feudal Japan. At the same time, its art style is heavily inspired by classic samurai cinema, particularly the films of Akira Kurosawa, focusing on picturesque landscapes, vibrant color palettes, and dramatic weather. The game famously includes a \"Kurosawa Mode,\" which renders the entire world in a cinematic black-and-white with film grain and altered audio, perfectly mimicking the look and feel of those iconic movies.\r\n</div>",

    "title": "Masterclass in Anti-Fatigue Open World Design | Ghost of Yotei Review",
    "description": "Ghost of Yotei, the newest installment in the acclaimed feudal",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "Ghost of Yotei, the newest installment in the acclaimed feudal Japan action series, shifts the stage to Ezo/Hokkaido Japan, introducing a new protagonist, Atsu, and a razor-sharp revenge narrative. Set during a tumultuous period, the game follows Atsu as she embraces the path of the Ghost to hunt down her targets. While built upon the foundations of its predecessors, Yotei immediately distinguishes itself by prioritizing refined gameplay flow and anti-fatigue design over overwhelming map density, setting it up as a truly modern open-world experience.\r\n**Pros**\r\n* ⬆️Improves upon the first game in almost every aspect. * 🧠Open world that flows like a tightly crafted linear experience.\r\n* ⚔️ Combat system is more fun, powerful, and incredibly versatile.\r\n* 🔪 Assassination mechanics are superior, featuring chain assassinations and numerous gadgets.\r\n* 🗺️ Map and quest design are minimalistic and highly anti-fatigue.\r\n* ❤️ Side quest content maintains the quality and depth of the main narrative.\r\n* 📜 Pure, focused revenge story provides a strong, cinematic narrative core.\r\n**Cons**\r\n* 💬 Still no option to skip dialogue line-by-line, necessitating full scene skips.\r\n* 🐌 Character development starts slowly before truly kicking in.\r\nFrom the outset, ***Ghost of Yotei*** presents a unique paradox: it’s an open-world game that never feels like one, and I'm saying that as a compliment. If you’ve ever played a cinematic, tightly constructed experience like *The Last of Us Part II* or *Uncharted 4*, you’ll recognize that focused, deliberate pacing here. The game manages to achieve a similar sense of momentum, making you feel as though you are constantly being propelled forward by an invisible, masterfully crafted narrative thread.\r\nIn *Yotei*, nothing seems a chore. This is perhaps in my opinion the greatest compliment that can be paid to a modern open-world title. The experience flows from exploring caves into working out where the hot springs is, and even the weapon unlocks, abilities, and bounties are all tied together into a single, cohesive progression loop. How smoothly everything integrates means you’d think it was a tightly crafted linear experience, yet the entire world of mainland Japan is yours to explore. This highly gameplay-focused approach means the pacing is very well done, focusing on gameplay and progression almost immediately without any boring padding.\r\n## Anti-Fatigue Design\r\nA massive contributing factor to this smooth flow is the game’s philosophy on map design and user interface. For once, an open-world game avoids turning its map into a migraine-inducing cluster of meaningless icons. The map and quest design are brilliantly minimalistic and very anti-fatigue.\r\nThis minimalist presentation extends directly into the gameplay. The UI disappears when not needed, keeping the screen clean and allowing the gorgeous environment to take center stage. You are encouraged to follow environmental cues—the wind, the movement of animals, the texture of the ground—rather than staring at a compass or mini-map. This deliberate approach to pulling the player into the world, rather than pushing them toward objective markers or bombarding them with information, is what makes the questing and progression so rewarding. Everything feels earned, not checked off a list. It also helps that there are multiple ways of finding where points of interests are, perhaps you'd prefer climbing a high spot, looking at your spyglass to spot these from afar. Perhaps you'd just want to buy a map from the cartographer and deduce where it is on the world map, or maybe you want to use your musical instrument Shamisen to let the wind guide you where you want to go, be it a Hot Springs to increase your health, a shrine to unlock new skills, a bamboo strike location to increase your spirit, and more.\r\nThis respect for player agency in discovery is echoed in the exceptional quality of the content itself. Side quests, 'Tales' quests, and even random encounters are not throwaway filler; instead, they are exceptional content that consistently rival the quality and depth of the main story. By treating every minor narrative with the same cinematic weight, *Ghost of Yotei* ensures that venturing off the beaten path is always a choice of intrigue, never a grind or a nuisance.\r\n## Powerful Combat and Traversal\r\nWhen it comes to engaging with the enemy, *Yotei* truly shines. The combat system feels superior to the previous *Ghost of Tsushima*, and it has arguably one of the bestcombat system in the genre right now. You feel the full weight and power of Atsu, the protagonist. She is a versatile engine of destruction, wielding a comprehensive arsenal that makes her feel like AC Shadow's Yasuke and Naoe rolled into one person with all the weapons she can use back and forth seamlessly. From the Katana (or even two of it dual wielded), Kusarigama, Yari, Odachi, Hankyu (Medium Bow), Yumi (Longbow), Tanegashima (Rifle) and multiple types of throwables such as Bombs and Kunais.\r\nBeyond the straight-up conventional weapons, the tools of the trade are elevated even for Stealth. *Ghost of* *Yotei* does assassinations way better, providing players with satisfying ways to clear out camps using chain assassinations, kunai and kusarigama assassinations, smoke bombs, and blind bombs. The sheer variety ensures that stealth doesn't become monotonous; you always have the right gadget for the job, even if it doesn't all go to plan.\r\nThis sense of fluid power also defines movement, which retains the grounded, focused style established in the series. While you cannot truly parkour onto every single surface on the map, the traversal is way better due to its smooth, intentional flow. The game avoids the open-world pitfall of excessive clutter, focusing instead on dedicated, well-placed open areas, climbing paths, and grappling points. This style ensures that when Atsu climbs a rooftop or scales a cliff, it feels deliberate and athletic, maintaining the cinematic weight of the action rather than devolving into mere free-climbing. This focused verticality makes exploration not just a means to an end, but an enjoyable part of the game loop.\r\n## Kill-Yotei-Six: A Revenge Story with Bite\r\nWhile many players enjoyed Jin Sakai’s personal 'Samurai or Ghost' struggles and the political drama of the previous entry, I love Yotei’s story more because it is a pure revenge story which 100% fits the ‘Ghost’ name. It is a no-nonsense revenge narrative, similar to *Kill Bill*—streamlined and highly focused. This approach creates a strong emotional hook right from the start of Atsu’s \"revenge tour.\"\r\nInitially, the characters felt underdeveloped as you are immediately thrown into the action, but they are slowly fleshed out through flashbacks and more dialogue as the game progresses. This patience pays off, creating connections that feel earned. I found the characters less insufferable than the companions of the previous game, and the main villain has more of a personal connection to Atsu than simply being a powerful conqueror. This narrative structure—where the tension builds with each step toward the final target—creates a more cinematic and personally engaging experience.\r\n## World Detail and Against Contemporaries\r\nThe move to mainland Japan (or rather, Hokkaido/Ezo) has allowed the developers to create a world that is visually spectacular, incredibly lively, and much more familiar looking and relatable. The graphics are crisper this now around, now built for the PS5. The environment feels interactive and grounded, particularly the foliage and grass effects, which are absolutely still best-in-class and unparalleled just like its predecessor. The overall visual design and artistry are exemplary. Furthermore, the cinematic weather system, especially the effect of rain, fog, and lightning, when it is fired up, adds a thick layer of cinematic atmosphere to every confrontation. The world, while vast, is designed for immersion and beauty. All of this is achieved while still being able to provide an option for 60fps gameplay without any noticeable blurriness in the resolution. The game is very well optimized compared to other modern titles.\r\nNow, we have to address the obvious comparison: *Assassin's Creed Shadows*. It released in a similar timeframe and shares a setting and theme. It is true that *Shadows* offered excellent weather systems, stealth and parkour systems, allowing players to climb nearly anything and explore a similarly lively world with detailed interiors. However, where *Yotei* pulls ahead is in its cohesion. While *Shadows* may have offered robust individual systems, *Ghost of Yotei* succeeds by merging combat, progression, world design, and narrative flow into a single, better made, anti-fatigue experience. The overall package of *Yotei*, when everything is summed together, simply never felt like a chore and proved to be the more satisfying open-world game.\r\n## Conclusion\r\n*Ghost of Yotei* is a phenomenal achievement that without a doubt improves upon the first game in almost every aspect. It provides a blueprint for how open-world games can respect a player's time while still delivering scope and scale. The side quest content is absolutely on par with the quality of the main quest, sometimes perhaps even better, meaning there is always something worthwhile to do. While I found a small annoyance in the inability to skip dialogue per line, similar to the first game, but that is a minor quality-of-life request that barely diminishes the final product.\r\nWith its best-in-class combat, masterful art design, and flawless pacing, *Ghost of Yotei* is easily one of the best games of the year and is a mandatory purchase for any fan of the action-adventure genre with even the slightest appreciation for ancient Japanese culture.",

    "category": "review",
    "body": "How do you follow up a game that redefined its genre and was universally praised as a modern masterpiece? In *Hades II*, Supergiant Games has answered that impossible question with a resounding success. The original *Hades* perfected the rogue-lite formula with kickass combat, endless procedural mechanics, and clever, character-driven storytelling. Yet, incredibly, *Hades II* has managed to top every single aspect of the first game and made them better. **Pros**\r\n* 👑 The world and hub area feel larger, featuring two major, distinct procedural routes.\r\n* 🔮 More unique, sophisticated weapon design and the new omega attacks elevate the action.\r\n* ♾️ The Incantation and Gathering system as a progression system is very engaging, surprisingly anti-fatigue, and deeply rewarding.\r\n* 🎨 Art Style is absolutely gorgeous, featuring the studio's signature vibrant 2D character portraits and environments.\r\n* 🎭 Clever storytelling that is in sync with the looping rogue-lite gameplay.\r\n* 🔥 Managed to improve upon the near-perfect rogue-lite formula of the original, in terms of combat, progression, and story.\r\n**Cons**\r\n* 🗡️Some players may miss the straightforward, archetypical weapons (sword, spear, bow, etc) of the first game.\r\nFor me, that anticipation was so immense that I painstakingly held off on playing the early access for a whole year, so my experience will be the same as the first game, where i played it after early access. The decision to wait was hard, everybody was playing it when it released on early access, but for me it was necessary: I didn't want to play it incomplete and risk burning out on the game even before its full release, ensuring I could experience the completed narrative for the first time.\r\nWhile you might still like some parts of *Hades I* due to personal preferences, because the first game is also a masterpiece, the sequel is a clear evolution in ambition, mechanical depth, and scale. You couldn’t go wrong with either game, but Melinoë’s journey feels like a true generational leap for the genre.\r\n## **The Fun Action-Packed Hack and Slash Combat**\r\nAt its core, the appeal of *Hades* has always been its fast, deep, engaging hack and slash action, and *Hades II* leans heavily into complexity. The runs are always engaging due to its procedural selection of “Boons” or selection of abilities that Gods will give you randomly per level, and the combat elevates them further. The game also switches it up from its predecessor: the familiar quick dodges from the first game (that was admittedly fun with boons) is now replaced by Melinoë's continuous sprint, fundamentally changing how the player traverses arenas and avoids damage. At first I was not a fan of this move, but after playing a while, I acquired the taste for it and i found really matched with Melinoë's style of combat anyway.\r\nThe weapons this time around are definitely more unique and sophisticated. Gone are the classic, archetypical fantasy weapons like the sword, spear, shield, bow, etc. that defined the first game. Instead, Melinoë, the Princess of the Underworld and our new protagonist, wields specialized witch tools that encourage specific playstyles. While my first thought was, \"how can it top the *Hades 1* combat, especially when the main character of Hades 2 is a witch and more mage-type, not a warrior like Zagreus?\", the answer lies in the shift to calculated aggression and resource management.\r\nMelinoë herself has a dedicated resource meter (Magick/Mana) used for her powerful \"Omega\" moves, fundamentally separating her abilities from Zagreus's pure physical attacks. This can create a rhythm of spending, retreating, and recovering that is more engaging than simple physical aggression, depending on the build. The \"Omega\" attack, a powerful, resource-draining move that requires you to hold attack buttons, is unique to each weapon and introduces a crucial layer of tactical decision-making, transforming simple button-mashing into deep, calculated action with a much higher mechanical ceiling. This change immediately makes the combat feel fresh, also adding a resource management aspect alongside aggressive boons from the gods.\r\n## **The Anti-Fatigue Progression Loop**\r\nOne of the game's greatest triumphs is the progression system. It is very engaging and very easy to learn. In typical rogue-lite fashion, you accumulate a lot of different ingredients and materials, which might look intimidating at first. The genius of the design, however, is that you truly don't need to stress over it: just keep playing, no need to pay close attention, just keep playing and you’ll get it as you do more runs.\r\nThis seamless progression is thanks to the central hub, the Crossroads, which acts as the anti-grind engine. Materials gathered during failed runs are used to perform Incantations - permanent unlocks that dramatically change the flow of the game, such as unlocking new weapons and functionalities, forcing your favorite boon provider god to appear, or enabling new powers and bonuses through the Arcana Card Deck system. Every failed escape attempt feels valuable because it inevitably leads to a permanent upgrade, ensuring that your time is always rewarded. The system is entirely anti-fatigue and perfectly complements the addictive nature of the combat loop.\r\n## **Larger Scope, Beautiful Artistry, and Narrative Depth**\r\nThe maps and the world feel bigger than ever. The home base where Melinoë retreats after defeat - the aforementioned Crossroads - is significantly larger than the House of Hades, populated by a wonderful new cast including the witch Hecate and several new Olympic gods, all providing services and commentary.\r\nCrucially, the game features two big procedural areas to run on instead of just one. Melinoë's main task is to journey through the Underworld to face the Titan Chronos (Time), but an entirely separate, brutal route opens up later that I won’t spoil. This route acts as another distinct, high-difficulty challenge, doubling the effective content and vastly increasing replayability as you pursue two separate endgame goals.\r\nThis storytelling prowess is amplified by Supergiant's unique aesthetic. The art style is absolutely gorgeous, featuring the studio's signature hand-drawn 2D character portraits contrasted with vibrant, dynamic isometric environments.\r\nThe clever storytelling is the true secret weapon of the franchise. The game leans in hard on the narrative that is entirely time-gated to the gameplay loop, meaning failure is never a full stop, but rather a necessary narrative beat. Every time Melinoë dies, she returns to the Crossroads, where characters react specifically to the progress she made, the items she found, or the bosses she defeated in her last attempt. This continuous, reactive dialogue - of which there are thousands of lines - ensures that the story moves forward relentlessly, even when the player is struggling. If the player dies, struggles, wins, or anything really, the NPCs will comment on that.\r\nComplementing this ingenious structure is the top-tier voice acting. Every god, minor NPC, and ally is brought to life with emotional depth, perfect comedic timing, and wit. Despite having no animations, cutscenes, mocap, or facial capture. The voice performers elevate the witty, modern script, ensuring that every spoken line whether it's an encouraging word from a friend or a condescending insult from a deity, advances the plot, deepens a relationship, or simply provides a necessary laugh. The way the narrative is implemented into the cyclical/looping nature of the runs remains utterly brilliant. Dialogue shifts and deepens with every interaction, making the character development feel organic and personally earned.\r\n## **Conclusion**\r\n*Hades II* is a phenomenal game that, without a doubt, improves upon the first game in every aspect without feeling that its rehashing anything. It takes a formula already considered perfect and somehow manages to expand it without adding bloat or frustrating complexity. The shift to a Magick-focused protagonist is a refreshing take on the formula and the progression system is unmatched in its ability to keep the player engaged. *Hades II* is a mandatory purchase for any rogue-lite or hack and slash fans. It delivers everything fans of the original could have hoped for and then some. It is the new high-water mark for the rogue-lite genre.",

    "tags": "",

    "category": "review",
    "body": "## Half-Life: Alyx\r\nAn immersive single-player narrative experience that looks, feels, and plays exactly like what you would expect from a Half-Life game. From the gunfights, interactable objects, physics engine, brilliant storytelling, memorable characters, to the immersive environments/levels. This game has got it.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Polished VR Experience - Proper Half-Life game - Comfortable to play - Insane level of detail - Excellent Storytelling - Immersive Gameplay ## Cons\r\n- Lack of melee combat ## 📜Level of detail We’re back to City 17. A very familiar place for Half-Life fans, seeing it in VR with Valve’s modern engine and masterful graphics is jaw-dropping. The city is more detailed than ever; more stuff to pick up, and more objects to interact around. Despite that, it still feels a lot like the city we’ve played in more than a decade ago.\r\nUnlike most VR games, Half-Life: Alyx does not try hard to make itself too realistic when it comes to VR interactions with the environment, especially with the inventory system. Having said that, there is no HUD. Everything is displayed on Alyx’s gloves and weapons instead.\r\nYou don’t have to get every weapon/item from all around your body, instead they’ll mostly come from a few conveniently well-made simple hand gestures and additional slots for each of your wrists. Ammunitions for reloading that you get from over your shoulder are automatically selected based on the weapon you’re holding. Valve really found the right balance of realism and mechanics here and I love their take on it. Everything feels natural.\r\nAs with your interactions with the environment, it is insanely detailed. It’s like another level of detail comparable from the jump in detail from 3rd person to 1st person. Now this is 1st person going to VR. Everything seems kind of personal and big. NPC’s are big and detailed, just as big or bigger than me. Objects seem like real objects. Enemies feel really threatening.\r\nAlmost everything can be picked up. Jars, bottles, glasses, crates, boxes, can be broken. TVs thrown around. Cabinets, drawers, opened. You might even find yourself an ammo or two inside these containers. They also solve the VR item pickup conundrum by the use of Alyx’s gravity hands. It’s no gravity gun from HL2; Much, much weaker, only enough for you to fling almost any small object for you to catch it. No need to walk over an item and crouch down to pick it up.\r\n## ⚔️Combat Continuing the trend of balancing realism vs mechanics, the combat is very well done. You can really feel the weight of the guns as well as their power when shooting. Aiming is accurate and the rumble feedback to my controllers are just right. The reload system they’ve implemented is smooth and reliable. Consistent and repeatable. ♥♥♥♥ ups are more on you than on the game’s mechanic.\r\nYou can also upgrade your guns through the use of ‘resins’ which are scattered and collected throughout the game. Upgrades like reflex sight (which I hated), and extended magazines are available. I wished they included an option to remove the sights though once I upgraded it as personally I was more comfortable using the iron sight.\r\nThe enemies, ranging from the mindless zombies, headcrabs, to the combine forces are all back and have been improved upon. Zombies and headcrabs are more unpredictable this time, making them harder to hit. Combine forces can now survive more gunshots, some can deploy shields, and can even deploy Manhacks of their own.\r\nWith it’s reputable physics engine and VR implementation, Valve missed a huge opportunity with the non-existent melee combat. Nothing can be used for melee: Pipes, bars, concrete blocks, barrels, even guns cannot be used for melee. Melee combat is basically null in this game.\r\nYou cannot even take advantage of the physics engine to kill off people like throwing stuff at or dropping things on them. For a game that has the crowbar as a series staple, the gravity gun as another, this game has none of any of that.\r\n## 📖Story The story is well written and engaging. It fleshes out Eli and Alyx’s stories even more. It gives you an idea of what their order of business was like before Gordon Freeman came along. Playing Alyx is somewhat a nice change of pace from playing Gordon Freeman again, it retracts that subconscious idea that your character is a total badass and can single-handedly destroy the enemy. A feeling that we have when playing badass FPS characters like Gordon, Masterchief, Doom Guy, etc. It makes for a game that has a character that seem normal, average, “not the chosen one”, and haven’t proven herself yet. That Half-Life vibe is still there though, especially the humor, bleakness, and mysterious nature.\r\nAnd it’s not just a side-story or a spin-off; other games are referenced in a much more direct and substantial way. To simply explain without spoilers, you definitely need to have played this or at least watched online before you play any future Half-Life games set after Episode 2.\r\n## 🗺️Level Design/Pacing Personally I used the full locomotion option as I am playing wirelessly. The FPS-like free movement is handled perfectly. I’ve encountered no dizziness whatsoever. As opposed to other VR games where I’m dizzy 15 minutes in, this one I can play for hours. I think it has something to do with the movement speed which is just perfect for me although some may say it’s a bit slow.\r\nThe level design is perfect for a VR game. Maps are big and spacious, there’s plenty of room to move around and explore while still preserving that linear map design. You will most certainly find yourself to the next area and you won’t get lost all the time trying to find the next corridor or door to open.\r\nUnfortunately for a VR game, loading screens are still a thing, as the classic Half-Life in-between level loading screens are back. Although they are much more bearable now with a holographic city-map view of your progression ala-Metro 2033 instead of just dull frozen moments with a “Loading” text at the center.\r\nThere are different types of puzzles in the game. One example are the level puzzles where you need to use physics or interactables; maybe you need to stack some crates, activate some levers, press some buttons, or provide power to some contraption. The transition from pressing a button to VR made all the difference. There are also the various mini-game hacking puzzles that are pretty entertaining. Puzzles are not too hard but will still give you a challenge. Some are straightforward, some might require a bit of critical thinking to solve. They get harder and harder as you progress through.\r\nAnd of course it isn’t Half-Life without a bit of horror and creepiness. Especially in one part, which is my favorite to say the least. I would say this is where I got the most immersion out of HL: Alyx and one of the strongest points. Truly one of the most horror experiences I had with a video game. This one part terrified me to the point that I was jumping around while playing! And they weren’t using jump scares or any cheap tactic. You’ll definitely know it when you see it.\r\n## 🖥️Technical Performance The game runs smoothly even with the resolution set to 120% on my rig: i7-8700k, 32GB RAM, and GTX 1080. No crashes, game-breaking bugs, or major glitches I've encountered. Using an Oculus Quest with ALVR, I was able to play wirelessly and experience free stick movement scheme to its fullest.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion While Half-Life: Alyx does not directly continue the series (as obvious in the title), It signifies Valve’s return to form when it comes to making singleplayer games, and they certainly deliver. If this is just Valve’s toes in the water into the Half-Life making business again, then I’m excited for what’s to come.",

    "category": "review",
    "body": "I first started Haven years ago on Game Pass with my partner, but frankly, it didn't click for us, especially as a co-op or 'couple game.' It’s supposedly a very light sci-fi RPG about two lovers, Yu and Kay, who have fled to an alien but beautiful world to escape an oppressive society and are fighting to keep their relationship alive. However, despite putting the game down, its cozy atmosphere and unique vibe resonated with me and somehow got ingrained in my mind for years. ### Pros\r\n* ❤️ The relationship of the two main characters feels genuinely real, setting a new lowkey standard for a romantic, slice-of-life story in a game.\r\n* 🏡 Masterful, unique cozy vibe that compels you to explore everything and live alongside the characters.\r\n* 🎧 Amazing soundtrack that perfectly syncs with the gameplay.\r\n* 📖 Subtle, unique worldbuilding is highly effective, creating an immersive sci-fi exile without heavy exposition.\r\n* 🎨 The art direction is gorgeous and consistent, creating a visually stunning and cohesive anime-like aesthetic.\r\n* 🫂 The game nails the portrayal of an *established* relationship, focusing on mature intimacy, small arguments, and constant mutual support.\r\n### Cons\r\n* 🧱 The gliding controls can occasionally work against the player, leading to small, frustrating moments of movement friction.\r\n* 🎮Coop gameplay feels forced/underbaked, its much better to play this as a solo player.\r\nThe feeling of being stranded in another world, yet carrying your own cozy environment with you (a ship full of life and personality), set in beautiful landscapes, and equipped with impressive gliding technology, all grew in my imagination. I always imagined returning to it someday after putting it down years ago, keeping it listed in my spreadsheet of \"to play eventually\" Well, that day finally came a few weeks ago when I installed it on my Steam Deck, and in my opinion it works better as a solo experience. The game is marketed as coop, but in my opinion the game works better as as solo player experience (perhaps with your partner just watching you play) because the coop gameplay elements feel underbaked or forced.\r\nI would argue that Haven is far more of a cozier, calming adventure and romantic couple story than it is the RPG survival game it is often described as, perhaps by even the developers themselves in an attempt to reach a wider audience. The core of the gameplay is navigating a planet full of islets connected by \"flow bridges,\" an energy phenomenon that also powers your impressive gliders, allowing you to seamlessly travel the beautiful landscape, fight corrupted enemies, purify the land, and find resources for crafting and cooking. The gliding is the main traversal method and boy it is fun to zip across the land, giving movement a satisfying rhythm that syncs perfectly with the soundtrack. This traversal method is designed for both solo and coop. In **solo play**, you control both characters simultaneously, they follow each other around. In coop play, one player glides while the other (still following the gliding player) can collect resources and activate boosts. My only **gripe** is that the gliding can sometimes work against the player, but those experiences are few and far between.\r\n### Intimacy, Worldbuilding, and the Slice-of-Life beauty\r\nThe game’s narrative strength lies in its subtle and unique worldbuilding. The lore uses sci-fi and Orwellian elements, mixed with post-apocalyptic and survival themes, but without the darkness, grittiness, or extreme hardships. This unique tone is supported by the narrative structure: the game inserts you directly into the middle of Yu and Kay’s adventure, without needing to explain every single thing at the get-go. When some exposition does arrive, it feels earned, and you truly appreciate the storytelling and the lore. The result is an experience that is deeply immersive, almost like you’re sitting by a campfire with the characters, living alongside them in that universe. I just love the premise of being stranded in a beautiful paradise with a cozy ship full of life with a partner, that i actually want that to happen to me.\r\nThis immersive atmosphere is built upon the perfect chemistry between the two leads. Yu and Kay talk and interact like a *real* couple. They sound like a real couple. Not every conversation has to be plot-heavy; some are just happy, playful banter, some involve just looking at the sky gazing at the stars, and some are just glazing at how delicious the food is. It truly feels genuine, achieving a slice-of-life quality, but set in their unique sci-fi exile, not our regular world. That genuine feel is very rarely seen in games involving romantic couples. The game's narrative is very immersive, focusing on the realistic chemistry of the couple through mundane yet intimate dialogue, a feat only made possible by the high-quality, convincing performances from both voice actors.\r\n### Combat: Simple, Yet Fits The Game nicely\r\nI was initially afraid that combat would be tedious or detract from the cozy vibe, especially since the first few hours focus solely on the gliding and exploration. Turns out, it wasn't that way, and it complemented the game perfectly. The fighting is best described as a rock-paper-scissors-like system; some enemies are weak to Blast, some to Impact, and often you need to time a guard or stun them with one character before following up with a quick pre-charged attack from the other. You command both characters, using the D-pad for Kay and the face buttons for Yu, with just five commands in total for each. While the combat isn't very deep, it’s not as basic as I expected, and coordinating these commands gives the system a satisfying tactile feel. Although the fighting will get repetitive a few hours towards the end, especially against weaker enemies, a major saving grace is the \"fast forward auto combat\" option, which takes care of that aspect automatically at five times the speed, as long as the characters are have levelled enough to take care of them on their own. You’ll have to learn to command both characters simultaneously for solo play, but for coop play, you get to focus on your one character's commands, at the expense of having to coordinate your attacks with your coop friend.\r\nYour characters gain strength over the course of the game by building their relationship meter. You level up this bond by nearly everything you do together, from cooking and sleeping to talking, or fighting enemies.\r\n### Stylish With A Banger Soundtrack\r\nThe overall aesthetic is stunning and cohesive, favoring a beautiful mix of anime and watercolor-pastel art style for the alien landscapes, creatures, and characters. This visual care extends to every detail, including the loading screens and menus, which are filled with gorgeous, personalized snapshots of Yu and Kay's relationship. Instead of generic tips, these pieces of art constantly provide intimate flavor and personality, the developers didn't even need to add these loading screen touches, but they understood that such detail is essential to reinforcing the game's central theme of enduring love. Simple things but it added so much to the personality of the game.\r\nAlso, the amazing banger electro-like soundtrack helped seal the deal for me.  It elevates the gameplay into an relaxing but rhythmic experience that defines the literal flow of exploration. This energetic score is perfectly balanced by softer, intimate pieces in dialogue and romantic moments, effectively amplifying the contrast between external adventure and the cozy domestic life of the couple in their ship.\r\nAnd I won’t forget about describing the opening sequence, which was nothing short of **stunning** and acts as an immediate emotional investment hook to rapidly tell the story of Yu and Kay's established, passionate love in beautiful colors and animation.\r\n### The Conclusion\r\nThe soothing, cozy aspect of the game completely changed my habits: I'm never much of a completionist, but this game made me go out and explore every nook and cranny of the world, purifying everything, finding every ingredient to cook, eating all the dishes, and experiencing all the dialogue it has to offer.\r\nHaven is overall a very calming, soothing, cozy experience wrongfully disguised as an RPG. It’s actually an adventure game with a heavy focus on a genuine, realistic, romantic story set in a unique sci-fi world. The 10-15 hour experience is definitely one of the best short experiences I’ve had in a while, and I think it’s a type of game that will stick with me for years to come. My only hope is that we get an eventual sequel.",

    "body": "**Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** initially raised some skepticism for me because of its first-person perspective, I really thought I wont like it because of the first person view, because i played Uncharted and Tomb Raider and I wanted those kind of games. I thought I knew better. However, I was proven wrong, as the first-person viewpoint here works remarkably well, creating a more immersive and personal experience that brings you closer to Indy’s world. ## Pros\r\n- 🕵️ Engaging first-person puzzles that feel natural and rewarding - 🤜 Combat style that captures the clumsy, scrappy feel of Indiana Jones - 🐍 Atmospheric environments that bring the adventure to life - 🎮 Phenomenal performance from Troy Baker as Indiana Jones\r\n- 🎵 Strong audio design with thematic music and voice acting ## Cons\r\n- 🐢 Stealth feels rudimentary and underdeveloped compared to other aspects - 📉 Some pacing issues early on that slow momentum - ⚙️ Occasional technical rough edges and AI glitches I would like to repeat again, that the first person view absolutely works! Not only your in tune and more immersed as Indy, you also get upclose and personal with the puzzles and locations, which can now be much more cramped and smaller because of the view. It allows you to lean in and inspect ancient mechanisms, decipher cryptic markings up close, and feel a genuine sense of tension as you peer into a dark, unknown passage. The puzzles are a major highlight; they strike an excellent balance between being challenging enough to make you feel clever and intuitive enough to avoid unfair frustration. This isn’t just watching a hero solve a mystery; you are the hero, you are Indiana Jones, and the feeling of discovery is consistently rewarding.\r\nCombat is simple but effective. It effectively captures the clumsy, scrappy feel of Indiana Jones. This isn't the slick, high-octane combat of a superspy; it's the desperate brawl of a professor who's in over his head. Punches feel weighty, the iconic bullwhip is both a tool and a weapon, and scarce ammo forces you to be resourceful rather than relying on brute force. This grounded approach is a refreshing change of pace that feels authentic to the character.\r\nThe stealth mechanics however, being a major part of the gameplay, are more rudimentary. You can sneak past enemies or set up simple ambushes, but these segments feel basic and underdeveloped compared to the rest of the game. They are passable and serve their purpose, but lack the depth to be a true highlight.\r\nWhile the game delivers a fantastic adventure, it's not without some rough edges. The narrative suffers from some pacing issues early on, taking a bit of time to find its adventurous rhythm. Especially since the after the tutorial, the game puts you at the heart of the Vatican, and it could take a while before you end up in mountains, jungles, or deserts. I also encountered occasional technical glitches and AI quirks that, while not game-breaking, briefly pulled me out of the experience. </div>",

    "body": "**Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (KCD2)** is the ultimate sandbox medieval RPG experience, delivering an unparalleled level of immersion and roleplaying depth. With a sprawling open world, branching questlines, and historically grounded storytelling, it stands as one of the most ambitious RPGs of recent times, maybe even of all times.\r\n## Pros\r\n- ⚔️ Deep, realistic combat system with authentic medieval mechanics - 🌍 Immersive open world rich in historical detail and environmental storytelling - 📜 Branching quests with multiple outcomes and player choices - 🎭 Strong narrative that respects player agency and roleplaying freedom - 🔧 Significant optimization improvements and bug fixes from the first game ## Cons\r\n- 🐞 Some quest bugs and logic issues still disrupt immersion occasionally - ⚔️ Combat changes simplify directional inputs, losing some tactical nuance - 🐢 Quest pacing can feel slow, especially in early-game segments The story is long but beautiful and incredibly rewarding. Its just really well-written, and it makes the whole world feel alive in addition to the already hardcore and sim-like nature. You can see this quality in everything, from Henry's main plot to even the smallest side quests. Because all the characters and situations feel so real and thought-out, the quests are more than just a checklist or a game length padder; they actually connect with you and are so well thought-out. There are so many memorable quests or encounters here, just like the first game. The different branching paths and tough choices get you invested, so you really care about what happens because of your actions. It just makes the game feel like a living world where your decisions truly matter.\r\nIt’s important to note, however, that this is a direct sequel. The narrative picks up right where the first game left off, and while it does a decent job of providing context through occasional exposition in some of the dialogue --- giving you a general idea of prior events, it’s still best experienced after playing the original to fully appreciate the single, continuous story.\r\nSimilar to the quest design, the story is filled with choices and branches that have a real impact, making every playthrough feel personal and unique. The world itself is a marvel, a historically accurate 15th-century Bohemia brought to life with painstaking detail. From a technical standpoint, the game is also a huge leap forward, running far more smoothly and with fewer bugs than the first game did at launch. It’s not 100% perfect, as I still encountered some quest logic bugs from time to time, but the overall experience is polished and stable. I can even run it on my Steam Deck at 30-40 FPS, which is highly impressive.",

    "body": "## SIFU (Nintendo Switch)\r\nIf you’re looking for a martial arts game that will remind you of the classic kung-fu movies you loved as a kid (maybe until now), SIFU has got it for you. It is now released for the Nintendo Switch.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Beautiful art style\r\n- Satisfying combat system\r\n- Well designed rogue-lite mechanics\r\n- High replayability\r\n- Play it on the go (Nintendo Switch advantage)\r\n## Cons\r\n- Short story\r\n- Limited by the Switch’s hardware (Would have benefitted from a 60fps performance)\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nImagine if beat’em up and Rogue-like had a baby named Bruce Lee. This is basically SIFU in a nutshell. It has a rather simple but effective revenge story: you play as a young man trying to take down the people that wronged you, maybe growing old along the way.\r\nThe gameplay setup is pretty straightforward, just beat up the bad guys to progress in a level. Each level is divided into multiple parts and there is a bit of open worldness to it. But for the most part, it is a linear single-player experience.\r\nSIFU is intensely kinetic; every successful punch, kick, or takedown, either to you or to the enemy can be felt and has heavy weight to it. Very reminiscent of games like Batman Arkham, or if you go further back in time, the old Matrix games for the PS2.\r\nThe combat is fluid and smooth. Landing combos and “accidentally” performing cool action sequences feels satisfying, especially after a series of successful dodges and parries.\r\nSpeaking of the parry system, it is both unforgiving and rewarding. I love the freedom they give you as to how to deal with enemy attacks. You can block them, which consumes your “structure”, basically the amount of damage before your defense is temporarily broken. You can also parry them, it requires perfect timing but has devastating effects for the enemy, If you fail, it will be devastating for you instead. Aside from those, you can also perform stationary dodges, which honestly looks cool as if you’re Neo from the Matrix, dodging attacks while firmly planted. You can also do a full “step back” dodge to evade the more heavier attacks like grapples.\r\nThe takedowns and ragdoll physics are so satisfying it almost looks like how the thugs on those popular martial arts movies go down, it gives you this feeling of being a badass. The animations and movesets are varied enough not to feel repetitive during the first many hours of gameplay. Aside from your fists, you can also use the environment and objects to your advantage. Each type of weapon has their own movesets which is a nice touch. You can pick up most objects on the ground, or maybe just kick them towards enemies.\r\n## Mechanics\r\nThe implementation of a rogue-like system is well done and in-line with the lore. Your character basically never loses as part of the story and ages a bit for every loss. The years added is determined by the difficulty level.\r\nAge is seen physically on the character and will positively or negatively affect your stats and bonuses. If you get old enough, you finally die and the playthrough ends. It is a bit forgiving compared to other rogue-likes as it gives you a bit of an allowance to fail, essentially making it a rogue-lite.\r\nAs you go along with a run, you gather XP that can unlock new abilities for that specific run. Unlock a skill enough times and it becomes persistent throughout your other runs. This provides some sort of replayability and gives it an end-game mechanic.\r\n## Replayability\r\nSIFU is short in itself, with five beautifully detailed levels with their own distinct art styles, color grading, and varying enemy types. Aside from the usual cannon fodder there are also “brutes” that can pose an additional challenge, culminating in a unique 1 v 1 boss fight at the end of every level. The pacing of the levels are well designed and respects your time. You almost never run out of enemies to beat up. Not too overwhelming, and not too stale. Despite the short plot, it is a rogue-lite afterall and replayability is a big factor in this genre, one that it does so well. I was able to finish the story in under 10 hours, but I was still excited in doing another run. I might say even more excited than the first time, because of the fun gameplay and mechanics.\r\n## Graphics and Artstyle\r\nGraphics wise, I think it is mostly the equivalent of the low graphics preset of the PC version. No worries though, as the Artstyle is beautiful and more than makes up for it. One that will probably stand the test of time and not get old graphically.\r\n## Performance\r\nPerformance wise, It ran a stable 30fps on Switch’s hardware, both in handheld and docked modes. With minor dips to low 20s during some intensive scenes. With SIFU’s simplistic art style, one might expect it will run a little bit better, perhaps even at 60fps, but the way the game is built just seems to require a lot of horsepower. Still, it is even more impressive that they managed a port of this caliber.\r\n## Perfect for the Switch\r\nI have to say, SIFU is perfect for the Switch’s use case: handheld, portable. It doesn’t have much need for the right analog stick. It only needs the face and shoulder buttons to effectively function, much like other non-shooter games. The bite-sized and rogue-lite nature of SIFU makes it an ideal game to be played on the go, in handheld systems such as the Nintendo Switch. For the price of $40, It is a worthy inclusion to your library especially if you love the martial arts, beat’ em up and rogue-like games.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nSIFU is a beautiful modern mix of martial arts beat’ em up action and rogue-lite gameplay. Kinetic single-player fun, loaded with a satisfying gameplay loop. A perfect addition for the Nintendo Switch’s library.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/2670905) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "We Who Are About to Die - Short Review (Early Access)\r\nWith how popular rogue-lite games are becoming lately, as well as the consistent popularity of the Ancient Rome setting throughout the years, I’m a bit surprised that we don’t have enough Gladiator style focused games already. Saturating the market like the zombie or world war tropes we have today. That soon is about to change, as we now have We Who Are About to Die, recently released on Steam Early Access.\r\nEver encountered a pretty cool arena combat or gladiator mechanic in a game? and said like “Man, I wish there was a full game focused on this”? —- Well, your wish is now granted. We Who Are About to Die’s main focus is all around the life of Gladiators. This is unlike most titles where the game just shallowly dips into the concept of gladiators by way of side content arena combat, mini-games, or side questlines.\r\nWe Who Are About to Die is reminiscent of melee / sword fighting games like Mount and Blade and Kingdom Come: Deliverance when it comes to combat and its approach to your freedom of directional swings. But with a twist: You now completely control the physics and the actual movement and momentum of your attacks. You control it using mouse movements, “swinging” or sliding it across your mousepad like some sort of motion control.\r\nThis physics-based unique combat system is the make or break feature of We Who Are About to Die. One that will leave you not only fighting against the enemy, but also fighting against the controls and the camera. It can be annoying, yes. It adds an extra to the challenge and it’s a bit unforgiving, especially when combined with the rogue-lite nature. Ultimately it is a rewarding experience once you figure out the controls and come up with your very own movesets and “hand made” animations to brawl your way into victories.\r\nAside from the fighting, We Who Are About to Die is also a part management game. As in you are managing your character’s career: Customize your fighter, grow and upgrade his skills, customize his training regime, manage his reputation, etc. Aside from the fun combat, the career mode aspect of We Who Are About to Die is just as fun.\r\nWe Who Are About to Die itself focuses on your journey as a Gladiator. From an unknown slave to a potential Grand Champion known across all of Terantia — the game’s setting. You start with your character by randomizing from a selection of backstories with different starting traits and skills. Customize the character in-between matches via different armor slots and melee weapons to select and bring into the arena. Your wins earn you money to buy equipment and services, along with influence to perform authoritative actions like rerolling the available items in the store, giving it some action RPG and looter elements.\r\nDespite being recently released in Early Access, We Who Are About to Die is very much playable and feels like a full game with fully fleshed out features and enough content. I highly recommend trying it out.\r\nFull In-Depth Review coming shortly here on Taptap! Stay Tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/2934908) Originally posted on TapTap.",

There is no dialogue in the game and all of the story is only conveyed through the characters' actions and interactions with the environment, bolstered by the impressive art style and sound design. This is something that is very hard to pull off narratively but Somerville manages to somewhat pull it off anyway.\r\nThe sound design is what striked me the most and it is superb. I was playing with full blast speakers on and when the sound of the alien machinery first played on my subwoofers, I said to myself I was in for a hell of an immersive experience. It’s important to note though, that If you think Somerville is action-packed all the way through — it is not. There are brief chase and quick-time sequences that will sometimes give you a bit of action along the way, but most of the game is spent walking around in gloomy environments and trying to progress throughout the land, solving puzzles periodically.\r\nFrom the get go, Somerville is a beautiful adventure game. In fact, one of the most beautiful games I’ve seen in a long time. That’s saying something considering this game’s graphics are literally 90s like with its low poly models and monochromatic textures. If you’ve played Another World, Somerville is literally that game but set in a War of the Worlds type of scenario, with gameplay elements heavily borrowed from both LIMBO and INSIDE.\r\nNote that when I said that Somerville is one of the most beautiful games I’ve seen, I intentionally used the word “seen”. As the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Somerville’s main gameplay is a 3D side scrolling game with puzzle elements, something it failed to execute at the same standard as its narrative and art style so far in my experience. You’re given too much freedom to roam around, and yet you’re regularly restricted by invisible walls blocking otherwise logically accessible areas. A clear indication of poor level design. Players should naturally find their way in games, not constantly bump around the limits of the play area, invisible or not, to find the proper path.\r\nThe puzzles are a bit difficult and clunky, but in a bad way. They are solvable, but only in a particular way that the designers intended you to. Sometimes that particular way is a bit too specific and you will get stuck longer than you wanted. The camera being farther than I preferred in some moments only adds to the frustration. This, combined with the game’s mostly gloomy and somber tone is a bad combination and can get you bored rather quickly.\r\nSo far, Somerville has been an enjoyable experience. Story wise, it is very gripping and intimate. While the art style and sound design are of award-winning quality. I would have enjoyed it even more with some improvements in the gameplay department to bring it up to level, but at its current state it holds up quite well, laboriously carried by the quality of its narrative, art style, and sound design.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/2983318) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## Pros\r\n- unique and satisfying combat\r\n- deep and addicting progression system\r\n- character customization\r\n- engaging career management elements\r\n## Cons\r\n- no controller support yet\r\n- unsatisfactory performance\r\n- clunky at times, both combat and the camera\r\n- no ranged combat nor animals to fight\r\nWith how popular rogue-lite games are becoming lately, as well as the consistent popularity of the Ancient Rome setting throughout the years, I’m a bit surprised that we don’t have enough Gladiator style focused games already. Saturating the market like the zombie or world war tropes we have today. That soon is about to change, as we now have We Who Are About to Die, recently released on Early Access.\r\nEver encountered a pretty cool arena combat or gladiator mechanic in a game? and said like “Man, I wish there was a full game focused on this”? —- Well, your wish is now granted. We Who Are About to Die’s main focus is all around the life of Gladiators. This is unlike most titles where the game just shallowly dips into the concept of gladiators by way of side content arena combat, mini-games, or side questlines.\r\n## A Unique Physics-based Combat System\r\nWe Who Are About to Die is reminiscent of melee / sword fighting games like Mount and Blade and Kingdom Come: Deliverance when it comes to combat and its approach to your freedom of directional swings. But with a twist: You now completely control the physics and the actual movement and momentum of your attacks. You control it using mouse movements, “swinging” or sliding it across your mousepad like some sort of motion control. This reminds me of two games that had the closest mechanic: The relatively obscure 90s PC game “Die by the Sword” and the recent indie isometric RPG “Examina”.\r\nThis physics-based unique combat system is the make or break feature of We Who Are About to Die. One that will leave you not only fighting against the enemy, but also fighting against the controls and the camera. It can be annoying, yes. It adds an extra to the challenge and it’s a bit unforgiving, especially when combined with the rogue-lite nature. Ultimately it is a rewarding experience once you figure out the controls and come up with your very own movesets and “hand made” animations to brawl your way into flying limbs, bashed heads, and glorious victories.\r\nDespite the heavy focus in the physics, We Who Are About to Die is far from being realistic nor it tries to be. The physics based combat system is just that, without any implications of trying to be a proper sword fighting simulator. As a result of being directly controlled, animations aren’t as smooth as the usual hack and slash game and will look clunky most of the time. The clunkiness nature is fine for the most part, as I found it part of the game’s charm.\r\n## What's missing:\r\nIt’s important to note though that We Who Are About to Die doesn’t have any of the traditional ranged medieval combat, like bows, crossbows, or slings to use. You can however throw melee weapons and use them as projectiles. Basically any weapon in the game can be thrown. As with the game’s unique physics combat, It adds another challenge on its own as to how you will land those shots. There are also no animals or beasts to fight as it is purely a human vs human combat game, which is unfortunate as animals are part of Gladiator contests as well.\r\n## Career mode\r\nAside from the fighting, We Who Are About to Die is also a part management game. As in you are managing your character’s career: Customize your fighter, grow and upgrade his skills, customize his training regime, manage his reputation, etc. This system brings back memories of various career modes of sports games like Fight Night or WWE that I’ve played throughout my childhood.\r\nAside from the fun combat, the career mode aspect of We Who Are About to Die is just as fun, and even more addicting. The dynamics of carefully selecting and preparing for your next matches from what’s available are engaging, gauging if such a match is winnable and has great benefits. As well as choosing what “Patron” — the sponsors of the arena — to impress. Different patrons have different focuses. For example one Patron might focus on Gold benefits, while another for skills and training. Things also take time in this game. The repairs, training, healings, etc can take one or more battles to complete. It is even a good choice to keep two sets of weapons or armor so you can send one batch for repairs.\r\n## Progression system\r\nAs for the rogue-lite nature, the game itself focuses on your journey as a Gladiator. From an unknown slave to a potential Grand Champion known across all of Terantia — the game’s setting. You start with your character by randomizing from a selection of backstories with different starting traits and skills. Customize the character in-between matches via different armor slots and melee weapons to select and bring into the arena. Your wins earn you money to buy equipment and services, along with influence to perform authoritative actions like rerolling or revealing the available items in the store, giving it some action RPG and looter elements.\r\nThere are also random events and decision making in We Who Are About to Die that adds so much flavor to an otherwise non-existent plot. Even something as simple as choosing a dialogue option out of a random event, or choosing your reward adds greatly to the game’s personality. You can also do an assorted list of minor actions like betting in matches, fundraising, or bribery. To potentially multiply your or easily deplete your credits and influences.\r\nMatches in We Who Are About to Die come in different types of gamemodes, such examples are the usual 1 vs 1, Many vs Many, Free for all, among others. All of which is mixed with a variety of modifiers like item bonuses, stat penalties, or additional allies. Add to that the different possible maps or “arenas” it can take place in and it gives you a plethora of possible match configurations. As your reputation grows, so do the arenas you fight into. From the pits, slums, to the arena and into the Stadium, as long as you don’t die trying.\r\nYou only need to die once and the playthrough ends, making every second of action thrilling and adrenaline filled because of that extra attachment to your character. The gladiators having a somewhat realistic endurance and damage model means you can die too easily and quickly with a simple mistake or stamina overuse. After you die, gold that is invested beforehand is retained to your next generated gladiator with a newly generated backstory and stats. You can also reroll the generated gladiator to another backstory, at the expense of foregoing the gold investment from your previous character.\r\nAll these aforementioned gameplay elements creates an addicting loop that will make you press the “To Battle” button again, and again, until you realize you spent the whole night playing. If Civilization has a “just more turn” syndrome, We Who Are About to Die is all about “just one more battle”.\r\n## Graphics and Artstyle\r\nUnreal Engine’s impressive lighting system carries the weight of the game graphically, with amazing lighting and shadow effects greatly enhancing the somewhat average looking meshes and textures. The Artstyle on the other hand is a bit caricaturish or cartoonish with the characters, which blends in nicely with the clunkiness nature of the physics combat system.\r\n## Early Access\r\nWe Who Are About to Die is still in early access with an expectation of 8 to 12 months to finish as per the developer. As always, take this with a grain of salt, as delays are pretty commonplace in the Early Access section. Fortunately, there are clear roadmaps that are laid out for the game. More game modes, equipment, events, maps, are all planned to be added during the early access period. One feature that I’m most excited about is the controller support, with the specific mention of supporting the Steam Deck as well, because right now, you can only play with a mouse and keyboard.\r\nDespite being in early access, We Who Are About to Die is very much playable and feels like a full game with fully fleshed out features and enough content.\r\n## Technical Performance\r\nThe game would definitely benefit from additional performance optimization, as We Who Are About to Die did not run exceptionally well as of its current state. This is disappointing considering the graphics aren’t really eye candy to begin with.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the free flow physics combat can get clunky sometimes. There are times that I’ve noticed my character’s arms will get stuck and wrap around its body in all sorts of glitchy ways.\r\nAs for the AI, Taking into account that this is a physics based melee combat game without actual animations, the AI is actually decent. It provides an enjoyable challenge throughout all my playthroughs. Not annoying, nor unforgiving, nor I ever felt that I was being cheated in the matches. Although it shines the most in 1 v 1 battles, either as a single match or a part of bigger battles where gladiators would basically lock on together in a 1v1 battle. For free for all or gang up scenarios, The AI can have a hard time tracking multiple enemies at once and can have difficulties fighting multiple enemies at the same time.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nAt an introductory Early Access price of $19.79 (10% off), We Who Are About to Die is a fun and unique gladiator game worthy of a try for fans of similar titles like Exanima, Chivalry, or Mount and Blade. Even at an early access stage, it is already addicting, fun, and playable. For those who are just mildly interested, you can support the game early. Or you can follow it and just wait out for more features such as controller support before buying.\r\nEarly Access price of $19.79 (10% off)\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/2937685) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Somerville is a sci-fi adventure / puzzle game where you control a man and his family caught up right in the middle of an alien invasion doomsday scenario.

The presentation feels very surreal that you almost can relate to it, especially with the random static noise emanating from the family TV. Then the mysterious somber nature ramps up rather quickly into a full blown alien invasion, perfectly capturing that feeling of being randomly caught up in it on a personal level. You can just about see yourself in the character’s shoes while playing. Imagining if such things happened to you and your family instead.\r\nSomerville is pretty short. You can finish it in under five hours, so the length is just comparable to a full feature film. And it does feel like a film sometimes, only that there is no dialogue in the game and all the story is only conveyed through the characters actions and interactions with the environment, bolstered by the impressive artstyle and sound design. This is something that is very hard to pull off narratively but Somerville manages to somewhat pull it off anyway.\r\nYou wander across the desolate landscape, searching for your family. Across the land, you will encounter various alien beings and technology, and when I say alien, it is indeed an alien sight to behold. The technology presented upon you is frankly one that I’ve never seen before. Far from the terrifying TV and movie tropes we usually see. The extraterrestrials are dreadfully otherworldly, and looked like they came from a foreign dimension with a whole different laws of physics governing them.\r\nArt Direction\r\nThe sound design is what striked me the most and it is superb. I was playing with full blast speakers on and when the sound of the alien machinery first played on my subwoofers, I said to myself that I was in for a hell of an immersive experience. It’s important to note though, that If you think Somerville is action-packed all the way through — it is not. There are brief chase and quick-time sequences that will sometimes give you a bit of action along the way, but most of the game is spent walking around in gloomy environments and trying to progress throughout the land, solving puzzles periodically. Personally I would have preferred the game firing on all cylinders, being action packed the majority of the way through. But that’s not how the game plays.\r\nFrom the get go, Somerville is a beautiful adventure game. In fact, one of the most beautiful games I’ve seen in a long time. That’s saying something considering this game’s graphics are literally 90s like with its low poly models and monochromatic textures. If you’ve played Another World, Somerville is literally that game but set in a War of the Worlds type of scenario, with gameplay elements heavily borrowed from both LIMBO and INSIDE.\r\nWe seriously need more games like this in the art direction department. Lots of games are focusing on the big spectacle, the photorealistic graphics, and immersive character views. Leaving little room for more of these kinds of games.\r\nGameplay\r\nNote that when I said that Somerville is one of the most beautiful games I’ve seen, I intentionally used the word “seen”. As the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Somerville’s main gameplay is a 3D side scrolling game with puzzle elements, the one thing it failed to execute at the same standard as its narrative and art style.\r\nAcross the sub five hour experience, Somerville has difficulties in assisting the players to progress naturally. Something that game lacked and desperately needed, a form of signposting could have been useful. The companion dog with the main character was truly a missed opportunity in proving the gravely needed assistance to alleviate much of the pain points.\r\nThe freedom you’re given is great, but spending most of your time trying to find the next thing that you can do, sometimes even backtracking multiple times, gets tedious fast. Players should naturally find their way in games, not constantly bump around the limits of the play area — invisible or not — to find the proper path.\r\nThe puzzles are a bit difficult and clunky, but in a bad way. They are solvable, but only in a particular way that the designers intended you to. Sometimes that particular way is a bit too specific and you will get stuck longer than you wanted. The camera being farther than I preferred in some moments also adds to the frustration.\r\nAside from the puzzle mechanic, your character also gets a unique ability thanks to an alien tech exposure. It can sort of interact with other alien techs along the way that might affect or change the environment to your advantage. It provides an additional element to the puzzle solving aspect of Somerville. The way your ability interacts with the alien tech was done so well it induces a soothing and calming feeling.\r\nAll these aforementioned gameplay quirks, combined with the game’s mostly gloomy and somber tone is a bad combination and can get you bored rather quickly.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3025062) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the follow-up standalone expansion to this year’s PC release of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, Continuing the first game’s story, more importantly its DLC “The City That Never Sleeps”. It introduces Miles Morales’ version of Spider-Man as the playable character and his “year one” activities in New York city.\r\nIs it really standalone?\r\nIf you’re wondering if you can play Miles Morales without playing the first game’s DLC, or even the first game itself, worry not. Miles Morales will give you a short video recap of all the things that happened before, including his origin story. This is something comparable to the very cool character introduction scenes seen in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\r\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales plays and feels very much like the first game. The combat and animations feels just about as smooth as ever, but not without its own personality stamped onto it. For instance, Miles has a different set of moves and animations compared to Peter Parker. In contrast to Peter’s more experienced and serious swinging form, Miles has a more youthful and playful approach to it. Miles also has two new cool abilities which are invisibility and electricity. So gameplay wise, it will feel very familiar to old players while still introducing fresh stuff to keep you interested.\r\nPerfecting the Spider-Man gameplay mechanics\r\nTo describe it for newcomers to the franchise, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (and the game that came before it) perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being Spider-Man. Swinging around in New York city, with total control over your maneuvers, responding to street crime. The combat is clearly inspired by the free flow combat of Batman Arkham and in a good way. Dodges and counters feel satisfying, the dopamine rush induced by performing really cool uninterrupted combo sequences are highly addicting.\r\nA more intimate story\r\nAs for the story, it’s much more personal and more of a coming of age for Miles. We see Miles here as a newbie Spider-Man, with his own trials and tribulations. Again greatly in contrast with Peter’s much more experienced and middle-aged story in the previous game. Also, we have already seen Peter’s coming of age story in other incarnations multiple times, so seeing Miles here instead of reliving Peter’s origin story again makes for a nice change. Having said that, you might think it’s just a repeat or rerun of Into the Spider-Verse — it’s not — The story is unique and interesting enough in its own right and even more highly recommended for fans of that film.\r\nTechnical Performance\r\nThe game feels and plays very much like the PS5 version, only now with support for ultrawide and superwide resolutions and a higher graphics setting ceiling. Performance has been satisfactory so far, maintaining 60fps on a mixed of ultra and high settings running on my 6 core 12 thread RTX 3080 setup. I tested it on my secondary rig with a 4 core 8 thread RX 580 setup and it still ran well, albeit struggling to maintain 60fps due to CPU limitations. It is also tagged as \"Verified\" for the Steam Deck and runs well if you lock the performance to 40fps.\r\nPC Release\r\nAt the moment, PC players should rejoice, now that all the recent Spider-Man games have now come to PC, with a proper port at that. Bringing uncapped performance and limitless visuals of the Spider-Man franchise to the PC platform. That is until Spider-Man 2 releases next year for 2023, exclusive to PS5. We might have to wait a year at best for that to come to PC, if it will ever come.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3187226) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales - Full Review\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fun kinetic combat\r\n- Best Spider-Man swinging mechanics and fluid animations\r\n- One of the best PC ports (support for ultrawide, DLSS, etc)\r\n- Modern synthetic soundtrack\r\n## Cons\r\n- Too short (under 10 hours)\r\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is truly one of the better games to have come out two years ago on the PS5 and PS4, and now we are lucky for another Playstation port to PC with this weekend’s release.\r\nThe follow-up standalone expansion to early this year’s PC release of Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales continues the first game’s story, more importantly its DLC “The City That Never Sleeps”, It introduces Miles Morales’ version of Spider-Man as the playable character and shows us his solo rookie activities in New York city.\r\n## Is it really standalone?\r\nIf you’re wondering if you can play Miles Morales without playing the first game’s DLC, or even the first game itself, worry not. Miles Morales will give you a short video recap of all the things that happened before, including his origin story. This is something comparable to the very cool character introduction scenes seen in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. It's a nice touch that is also useful for returning players that might have otherwise forgotten or missed what happened.\r\n## Miles, the floor is yours\r\nIt starts off with the two Spider-Men working together to do some pretty intense crime fighting and a bit of mentoring session for the duo. It is amazing to play as Miles and see Peter Parker working, swinging, and fighting with you during the relatively explosive introduction set piece. Quickly afterward, the narrative direction immediately gives the floor to Miles after Peter Parker decides to take part in some working vacation to Europe. Now Miles has New York solo to himself, a big and at the same time scary responsibility.\r\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales still plays and feels very much the same. The combat and animations feels just about as smooth as ever, but not without its own personality stamped onto it. For instance, Miles has a different set of moves and animations compared to Peter Parker. In contrast to Peter’s more experienced and serious swinging form, Miles has a more youthful and playful approach to it. It feels very familiar to old players while still introducing fresh stuff to keep you interested.\r\n## Newcomers to the franchise\r\nSince I will spend most of the review here unavoidably comparing Miles Morales to the Spider-Man Remastered, I shall describe the game series as a whole first for newcomers to the franchise. Both Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Spider-Man Remastered perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being Spider-Man. Swinging around in New York city, with total control over your maneuvers, responding to street crime.\r\nThe combat is clearly inspired by the free flow combat of Batman Arkham and in a good way. Dodges and counters feel satisfying, the dopamine rush induced by performing really cool uninterrupted combo sequences are highly addicting.\r\n## The Gameplay Evolution\r\nMiles Morales feels like a natural evolution and continuation of the game series. It picks up the story and never missed a beat. Gameplay wise, For returning players, most of the skill progression of Spider-Man in the last game was kept intact. For example, many of the simple movement and fighting skills you spent most of the previous game unlocking for Peter are now base abilities for Miles. That way returning players wouldn’t feel like they’re starting again from scratch while still not being instantly too powerful for newcomers.\r\nBecause of this I would recommend playing Spider-Man Remastered first before this one, if you haven’t yet but plan to do so anyway. If you play Miles Morales first, you might feel a little bit “nerfed” if and when you finally try out the original game.\r\n## The one game that I actively avoid using the fast travel system\r\nPersonally, I found the acrobatic and fluid animations of Miles Morales more aesthetically pleasing and satisfying to perform. Something that is already extremely satisfying in the first game even got better. Why? This is one of the games where I actively avoid fast traveling because swinging is so damn awesome. The swinging never gets old. Spider-Man never gets old.\r\n## Abilities and Gadgets\r\nOne of the ways Miles differentiates his Spider-Man from the OG are his newfound “Venom” abilities. And if you’re thinking of the symbiote Venom, it's not that. While the gadgets have been reduced from eight to only four, Miles now has two new cool abilities which are electricity and invisibility.\r\nThose two aspects are given more emphasis in gameplay instead of gadgets. While you can no longer do cool web gadget combo combinations (due to the lack thereof), you can now use Miles’ numerous bio-electricity abilities in fights that do high amounts of damage and are aesthetically pleasing with its yellow-ish electrical explosion effects. All of which you can mix up with your regular combos and finishers.\r\nHis invisibility on the other hand, adds freshness to the otherwise basic stealth sections of the series as well as introduces another layer of combat. In addition to his unique skills and abilities, he also has his own roster of suits and costumes that you can unlock and upgrade over time.\r\n## A great game just in time for the Holidays\r\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is kinetic and action packed from beginning to end. You can finish it in under 10 hours, less than half of the original game’s length. A lot less filler and full of action, but still in the end I was left wanting for more.\r\nAs for the story, it’s much more personal and more of a coming of age for Miles. We see Miles here as a newbie Spider-Man, with his own trials and tribulations. Again greatly in contrast with Peter’s much more experienced and middle-aged story in the previous game. Also, we have already seen Peter’s coming of age story in other incarnations multiple times, so seeing Miles here instead of reliving Peter’s origin story again makes for a nice change.\r\nHaving said that, you might think it’s just a rerun of Into the Spider-Verse — it’s not — The story is unique and interesting enough in its own right and even more highly recommended for fans of that film.\r\nIt's perfect timing to release this again very close to Christmas, as it takes place around Christmas time, which shows New York in a different light: covered in snow and colorful lights. I appreciate the extra touch that they did in making this game visually different and in-line with the heartwarming spirit of Christmas.\r\n## Amazing Soundtrack\r\nSoundtrack is one of the aspects where this game shines the most and gives its distinct personality. We are no longer bound to Peter Parker’s gracious and orchestra heavy “great power, great responsibility” soundtrack, so now finally we can get more creative with the music. It is now more synthetic and modern, much more in-line with Miles' personality and cultural heritage.\r\n## Technical Performance and PC Release\r\nMiles Morales feels and plays very much like the PS5 version, only now with support for ultrawide and superwide resolutions and a higher graphics setting ceiling. Performance has been satisfactory so far, maintaining 60fps on a mixed of ultra and high settings running on my 6 core 12 thread RTX 3080 setup. I tested it on my secondary rig with a 4 core 8 thread RX 580 setup and it still ran well, albeit struggling to maintain 60fps due to CPU limitations. It is also tagged as \"Verified\" for the Steam Deck and runs well on my testing if you lock the performance to 40fps.\r\nAt the moment, PC players should rejoice, now that all the recent Spider-Man games have now come to PC, with a proper port at that. Bringing uncapped performance and limitless visuals of the Spider-Man franchise to the PC platform. That is until Spider-Man 2 releases next year for 2023, exclusive to PS5. We might have to wait a year at best for that to come to PC, if it will ever come.\r\n## Conclusion\r\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the best Spider-Man game yet and is a truly worthy new entry to the game series. It takes everything that is good with the Spider-Man games, improves and compresses it into a fresh kinetic fun action that you can experience in under 10 hours.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3255036) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Welcome to Evil West. A third person twisted mashup of all the gritty genres that we all hate to love. Steampunk, Western, Supernatural Horror, Gothic, Souls-like, Shooter; you name it, Evil West has got it.\r\nEvil West is set in an alternate version of Old Wild West America, with vampires and monsters battling against steampunk tech powered cowboys for supremacy. You control Jesse Rentier, a relatively established Vampire Slayer and heir apparent to the Rentier Institute, a monster hunting organization founded by his forefathers and now led by his father, in their quest to eradicate the land of monsters.\r\nThe linear campaign, which can be played either Solo or Coop, starts off right away with a typical wild west scenario of stopping a train with dynamites. It gave me flashbacks of my time with Red Dead Redemption 2, with very similar vibes going along. It doesn’t waste its time by immediately establishing itself as the high octane game it described itself to be by introducing the combat mechanics. As you go along the game, you are introduced to the various moves, weapons, and equipment available at your arsenal. As well as the different combat approaches you can take and play with.\r\nSo far every weapon and equipment in the game has its own skill tree for additional customization. Weapon types ranging from close range shotguns, high powered revolvers, to long range rifles. In addition, you also have the state of the art signature melee weapon: The Rentier Gauntlet. Which is basically a Wolverine Gauntlet powered by Electricity / Lightning.\r\nEvil West doesn’t take itself too seriously and doubles down on its absurd setting and genre to the gameplay’s benefit. You can dodge, block, parry attacks as well as mix and match melee and ranged combat on the fly along with your other gadgets such as bombs and shields. Enemies stay in the air when fired or damaged upon so you can continue your momentous combo and do additional damage. Explosions of blood splatter around everywhere even for the smallest hits that you do, making everything more visceral and gory.\r\nYou have total control over your guns as your pistols are fired via hip-fire while your rifle can be fired while aiming. This system makes for quick combos between the two (in addition to the inherent melee combat) without the need to manually switch weapons. Tools are also activated rather quickly and don't care much about long wind up times or annoying channeling animations to succeed.\r\nThe monster enemies on the other hand are challenging, feral, and mostly swarm-like in its behavior.\r\nNumerous enemy types are present in Evil West; from the mindless zombie-like Boo-Hags, to the Werewolf-like Nagals, up to the higher level bosses that you can fight . All have their own strengths, weakness and they perfectly compliment the combat system provided to us. You also encounter human enemies occasionally and combat can revert to a more of a traditional third person shooter type.\r\nEvil West is truly action packed and is one of the best examples of power fantasies I’ve seen in a while. The gameplay feels gratifying and empowering, from the combat system, the item customization and progression, up to the straightforward no non-sense linear campaign design.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3289541) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## Pros\r\n- fluid and snappy combat\r\n- focused linear map design\r\n- keeps it fresh from start to end\r\n- unlimited ammo, so you can focus on the action\r\n- full of personality, with its mixing of different genres\r\n## Cons\r\n- no manual saves\r\n- underwhelming story\r\nEvil West is a newly released third person twisted mashup of all the gritty genres that we all hate to love. Steampunk, Western, Supernatural Horror, Gothic, Souls-like, Shooter, and the like.\r\nYou play as a vampire hunter in the 18th century, set in an alternate extreme version of Old Wild West America. Vampires and monsters exist in this reality while the world is a bit more advanced technologically, with heavy use of steampunk and electropunk elements. This makes the forces of good and evil still evenly balanced despite the additional extremities of the world.\r\n## A Badass Larger Than Life Main Character\r\nYou control Jesse Rentier, a relatively established Vampire Slayer and heir apparent to the Rentier Institute, a secret monster hunting organization founded and since been led by his forefathers up to now his father, in their quest to eradicate the land of monsters. Along with him are Edgar, senior agent, veteran hunter, and right hand man to his father, and Emilia Blackwell, a medical doctor and researcher.\r\nThe linear campaign — which can be played ni either Solo or Coop — can keep you busy for roughly 10 to 15 hours. It starts off right away with a typical wild west scenario of stopping a train with dynamites and It doesn’t waste its time by immediately establishing itself as the high octane game it described itself to be with the introduction of its combat mechanics.\r\n## Not really the narrative driven experience they make it out to be\r\nThe story is a bit generic, and bears many similarities to the story “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter” showered with heavy western influences. The story is not one of the strongest points of Evil West, as characters are two dimensional and unmemorable, with the story at best only serves to move the game forward into the various different levels, environments, and enemies. Without much interaction with NPCs nor choices to make. At the end of the day, it gets you invested enough to play the game and experience the fun combat, where Evil West really shines.\r\n## Linear doesn't always mean bad\r\nThe campaign design is not for everyone, but it's a nice nod back to the more classic days of map design. Evil West is mission based and in between them you visit the hub / headquarters to roam around and do stuff like buy upgrades and customize your setup. This is something I dearly missed in games and would like to see more often. The environment variety is surprising and exceeded my expectations for a western game; as I saw more than just a bland desert in the levels.\r\nEvil West is pretty much linear with slight detours on the way for additional lootables, for those who like to explore in which you can find cosmetics, money, and collectibles. Money that can be used for upgrades and cosmetics to change the look of your character without any stats or gameplay changes. One personal gripe I have though is the inability to save manually, as checkpoints aren't always the best mechanic to save player progress.\r\nThere are simple puzzle elements in this Evil West which adds a little bit of complexity in it. They’re not too hard to be frustrating, mostly just straightforward to be mildly interesting and give a little bit of satisfaction to the player solving it. There are also different difficulty options as well as the option to enable permadeath, for those looking for that extra challenge.\r\n## Go Guns Blazing, focus entirely on the action\r\nMy favorite aspect of the Evil West is the Unlimited Ammo. Every weapon in the game has unlimited ammo capacity. Each weapon still has their own magazine capacity to deplete, easily determined from your targeting reticle, but reloading is free and doesn’t need any kind of overarching ammo requirement. This way you can completely focus on the action and not worry about conserving or finding ammo or not having to use your most powerful weapon to save it for a difficult encounter.\r\nAs you go along the game, you are introduced to the various moves, weapons, and equipment available at your arsenal. As well as the different combat approaches you can take and play with. You can focus on melee combat, or ranged, or even a mix of both.\r\n## Interesting progression from start to end\r\nEvery weapon and equipment in the game has its own skill tree for additional customization to unlock new effects or bonuses, ranging from simple passive bonuses to a more active upgrade that changes how the game plays, for example by adding an additional move like a dash forward. It’s commendable that it maintains this same pace of introducing interesting new unlocks, keeping it always fresh throughout the playthrough.\r\nDifferent weapon types are available from close range shotguns, high powered revolvers, to long range rifles. In addition, you also have the state of the art signature melee weapon: The Rentier Gauntlet. Which is basically a Wolverine Gauntlet powered by Electricity / Lightning.\r\n## if it ain't broke, don't fix it\r\nEvil West suffers from its own freedom of customization however, because you’re likely to stick to what works and what’s already leveled up and powerful instead of trying out every weapon that you find. You also might find some abilities or skills pretty overpowered than others, and that can be easily used to cheese your way into defeating enemies.\r\n## Full of Personality\r\nEvil West doesn’t take itself too seriously and doubles down on its absurd setting and genre to the gameplay’s benefit. You can dodge, block, parry attacks as well as mix and match melee and ranged combat on the fly along with your other gadgets such as bombs and shields. Enemies stay in the air when fired or damaged upon so you can continue your momentous combo and do additional damage. Explosions of blood splatter around everywhere even for the smallest hits that you do, making everything more visceral and gory.  This is reminiscent of games like Doom and Remnant: From the Ashes.\r\nThe animations are fluid while still being snappy and the character is a delight to control; very responsive, especially in combat. You have total control over your guns as your pistols are fired via hip-fire while your rifle can be fired while aiming. This system makes for quick combos between the two (in addition to the inherent melee combat) without the need to manually switch weapons. Tools are also activated quickly and don't care much about long wind up times or annoying channeling animations to succeed.\r\nThe monster enemies in Evil West are challenging, feral, and mostly swarm-like in its behavior. Numerous enemy types are present in Evil West; from the mindless zombie-like Boo-Hags, to the Werewolf-like Nagals, up to the higher level bosses that you can fight . Each type has their own sets of movements and behaviors and they perfectly compliment the combat system provided to us. Boss fights on the other hand defaults to a more Souls-like approach, where telegraphing and careful strategy triumphs over style. You also encounter human enemies occasionally and combat can revert to a more of a traditional third person action shooter.\r\n## Technical Performance\r\nPerformance wise, Evil West is smooth as butter and runs well on my 6 core 12 thread CPU with an RTX 3080. Further testing on my older system with 4 cores 8 threads and RX 580, it can easily run at a stable 60fps on a mixed medium/high settings. I dare say that it is an old hardware friendly game to run and should be no problem for most gaming PCs built in the last 6-7 years. The performance is as impressive as the game's gritty and dark visuals, having no business being as good looking as it is. Yes, it can be a bit too dark at times, but I suppose this is just part of the games art style.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nEvil West is a game full of personality, action packed and is one of the best examples of power fantasies I’ve seen in a while. The gameplay feels gratifying, empowering, and exhilarating. Despite some minor shortcomings in the narrative department. The combat system, customization, and the campaign design are all what makes it fun. A must have for any third person action fans out there.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3317152) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Ever since I was a child, I always dreamt of taking my games with me when going out, and It always came with huge compromises. It meant that I wouldn’t be taking my console or PC games with me, and I’m stuck with a portable handheld with its own different and toned down games (Gameboy, Playstation Portable, Nintendo DS, Switch, etc)\r\nNot anymore. Last year, the Valve Steam Deck was announced. While it released early this year with extreme scarcity, recently it became relatively abundant that I was finally able to purchase and receive it around two months ago. Here are my thoughts.\r\nThe Steam Deck is a handheld PC / Console hybrid that is clearly one of a kind. It is everything I dreamt of and more. It meant that I can now take my existing PC library that I have built throughout the years, install it on the device, and play it just like at home. It has a console-like interface, simple to use and easy to get into playing, while hidden under it is a much more traditional PC setup, which you can access via Desktop mode.\r\nIt is currently available for preorder for US, Europe, and Canada. And is also available reservation via Komodo in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. With more countries to come soon.\r\nUSD SRP is at $399 USD 64GB  |  $529 USD 256GB | $649 USD 512GB.\r\nIt is powered by the Steam Platform, the same client that most PC users have been using to download and play PC games over the years. So no need to rebuy games for your PC and your handheld, there is instantly cross compatibility between the two. Seamlessly transfer progress via cloud saves, play with PC users, and the ability to customize it as you see fit thanks to modding.\r\nCut to the chase, here’s an easy to digest breakdown of some of the things the Steam Deck can do:\r\n- Comes in 64, 256, 512GB options, with the ability to expand storage via SD Card or easy replacement in the internal SSD to 1TB or even 2TB\r\n- Same library collection as your PC, it uses Steam platform and can also play games from other platforms like Epic, Battlenet, and Origin/Uplay.\r\n- Play almost any PC game, indie or even AAA titles. From Hades or Stardew Valley, to Spider-Man Remastered or Cyberpunk 2077, it is playable.\r\n- Play handheld or connect to a Display / TV via any generic USB-C to HDMI dock or the official Steam Deck Dock.\r\n- Support for almost any PC accessory: Xbox, Playstation, Switch controllers, bluetooth or wired earphones, gaming keyboards and mice, etc.\r\n- Use game streaming services like Xbox Gamepass, Playstation Now, NVIDIA Geforce, or its built-in local streaming solution Steam Remote Play.\r\n- Use it as a desktop PC, install office apps or even just browse the web.\r\n- Install Windows 10 or 11 on it to make it a more traditional PC if you like.\r\nFor non-gamers, console users, newcomers, worry not; As the interface is easy to navigate. You just browse the Steam Store to find games to purchase / download and just click play. The Steam Deck just like any game console you ever used. No tinkering required nor complex tutorials to follow. Although learning how to tinker comes with great benefits.\r\nSince I am already a PC power user, I found the desktop mode fun to use, in fact for me it is a game in itself that I spent hours tinkering about. Customizing my library, my games, my setup, even just plain testing random games to see if they will work well. I have probably spent most of my first weeks with the Steam Deck tinkering than actually gaming.\r\n## Performance\r\nMost games run absolutely fine on the Steam Deck. You can play slightly older games at a locked-in 60fps at its native 800p resolution, while recent AAA titles can also run with a bit of tweaking and a lower fps setting (40 fps is highly recommended).\r\nThe only downside is that because it is running on Linux (SteamOS) , there are selected games that wouldn’t work properly for now, mostly in the realm of multiplayer games because of OS level anti-cheat support. The good news is it is currently being worked on by Valve and willing developers and the list is growing by the day. Since it's still a PC though, there’s nothing stopping you from just installing Windows OS on it, and just playing on it like a normal gaming PC.\r\nBattery life is a bit of a mixed bag, especially for those who doesn’t know how to tweak settings and just run / play the games. But for me, it is a great compromise between weight, heat, and price. You can run most games at an average for 1 hr 30 mins to 3 hours, depending on your games and your setting. I found that tweaking settings for every game can easily give you more than two hours of playtime. I can even reach 4-5 hours for older indie titles. Poor battery life or not, this is something a simple powerbank or a nearby outlet can't solve.\r\nThe Ergonomics are designed exceptionally well. I have a very undersized set of hands and I was worried at first about compatibility, but they are still comfortable for me to play. You might see the Steam Deck as a little too big for a handheld and worry about the weight, but when you finally hold it, it feels lighter than expected.\r\nThe analog sticks and face buttons are almost full sized, just a tad smaller than Xbox / Playstation. There is also the two trackpads as additional input (usually configured as mouse cursor or anything you want really, thanks to Steam’s in-depth controller configuration capabilities), plus four back buttons, Gyro controls, and a touchscreen display.\r\nBecause of the points mentioned above, The Steam Deck easily has the most versatile controller to ever exist right now. Even beating the likes of Xbox Elite Series 2, and the Dualsense, as far as utility goes.\r\nUpgradability and repairability are also executed perfectly in this device. While the models are just 64, 256, and 512GB versions, you can easily upgrade the internal SSD to even 1TB or 2TB, just opening the backplate and popping in a supported SSD like how you do in most laptops.\r\nRepairability is also emphasized and empowered to users, with Valve partnering with iFixit to be able to offer customers the ability to purchase replacement parts for just about anything.\r\nTo sum it up, The Steam Deck is easily the greatest piece of gaming tech that I've ever owned. This is coming from someone who has owned various gaming PCs over the years, gaming consoles, handhelds, and even niche products like Flight Simulator sticks and VR headsets.  If it ever becomes available to your region (or if you can find a way to purchase it from abroad), it is a highly recommended device to purchase.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3409620) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "At a glance, the gameplay and graphics of Soccer Story looks like a mashup of Pokemon and Stardew Valley with a nice touch of clean 3D graphics, but the comparisons end there, as within Soccer Story is a fun semi-physics driven gameplay that has a very healthy obsession with soccer.\r\nThe entire premise of Soccer Story revolves around the namesake sport, blamed to have caused some kind of calamity in the previous year, ultimately leading to its worldwide ban. That is, except for usage by Soccer Inc. in its heavily regulated matches, effectively being monopolized.\r\nYou play as a boy: Leo, or a girl: Kai — depending on your choice — that has been mysteriously chosen by a magic flying soccer ball in his/her quest to revive the sport and remind the world what the forgotten sport of soccer is.\r\nThe gameplay centers around free roaming and exploring the different locations starting with your hometown. Completing various quests to advance the story, convincing the people to rally back to Soccer, As well as doing optional mini games scattered around the map to gain rewards or skill upgrades. Just your run-of-the-mill typical RPG gameplay, fused with Soccer.\r\nMost of the mini-games and quests revolve around using your trusty magic soccer ball — which you can summon at will to play around with — to perform tasks; such as hitting trees to drop acorns requested by an NPC, or hitting toppled trash cans, bringing them back up to help a local with her job.\r\nSoccer Story starts off a little too slow and honestly boring. Most of the introductory quests are just there to introduce you to the mechanics. I feel that they are a bit uninteresting, a chore-ish to do with little to no assistance from the narrative to drive you and keep you interested in moving the game forward.\r\nThe map is also a little bit too spaced out and I found the travel time a little tedious, but I believe it is a conscious design decision to emphasize soccer and to have some distance for the soccer player and the ball to travel and mess around with.\r\nFurthermore, Soccer Story rarely deviates from its heavy utilization of the soccer ball to its gameplay, to its own demerit. Most of the different mini-games and quests ultimately boil down to hitting some stuff with the soccer ball, which can get old pretty fast.\r\nThat changes though as soon as you finally progress through the game and start getting into some real Soccer matches and competition cups. The gameplay suddenly transforms from a chill RPG exploration into an authentic high octane sports game. A fun and exciting game mode that is a whole different game on its own. If Pokemon has its turn-based battles in heavy contrast to its map exploration, Soccer Story has these Soccer matches.\r\nYou play as a team of five, technically only four as the goalie is controlled by computer, and have four minutes to score more goals than the opposition. Pass to teammates, outmaneuver the opposition, and shoot the ball to score. On the defensive side, you can try and steal the ball, or perform a risky tackle; if you miss, you temporarily stun yourself, if not, you stun the enemy.\r\nThis game mode is simple but largely fun and is rightfully the most exciting part of Soccer Story, except for a few frustrations that I’ve encountered mainly with the computer goalies: They are quite inconsistent, they will sometimes miss defending a pretty straightforward shot, and yet sometimes completely be impenetrable.\r\nThe same game mode also appears and is directly accessible from the main menu's Quick Match and playable with up to 4 players local co-op or PVP, although entirely unrelated from the story and its progression.\r\nWith its relaxing ambiance, soothing soundtrack, along with high octane soccer action, Soccer Story is a very fun  ̶n̶a̶r̶r̶a̶t̶i̶v̶e̶  soccer driven adventure RPG game with a bit of local multiplayer in as an added bonus. Highly recommended if you’re already on the fence.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3481326) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Ever wanted to step in a kid's shoes once again? dream and let your imaginations run wild? Yes? Well unfortunately for you, you are now a kid named Bill, and he has nightmares.\r\nIn Nightmare is an atmospheric stealth horror game in the likes of Limbo and Little Nightmares, but in third person isometric view. A mix of puzzle solving and exploration, as well as a bit narrative driven, in a psychological sense.\r\nThe whole game is set in Bill’s nightmares while in a coma, across all the nightmarish renditions of the past traumas of this seemingly troubled kid. Alongside him is a glowing butterfly spirit companion that you can use to look ahead and scout locations and detect enemies. A simple mechanic that is complementary to the game’s limited vision due to its isometric view.\r\nIn Nightmare is full of puzzles, and for me it's the game’s best feature. Most of them are well made and they come in all shapes and sizes. I didn’t find anything too hard and most of them, while mildly difficult, are still pretty logical in their approach to finding solutions. This is unlike the similarly puzzle potent game Hello Neighbor where the solutions are illogical and just plain random.\r\nDespite being a narrative driven game, In Nightmare is amusingly minimalistic in its storytelling. There is no dialogue, only actions of the characters as well as the letters you can find in the game to better explain Bill’s situation from a third person view, from doctors, psychologists, etc.\r\nImmersion wise, In Nightmare does a really great job of placing you into Billy’s shoes, what is he experiencing emotionally and psychologically. The nightmare itself is atmospheric and at the same time unsettling; A mix of goth and lovecraftian vibes, while the artstyle is a bit cartoonish and pixar-like. Despite this it is still a scary game in terms of atmosphere and ambiance. There are the occasional semi-jumpscares, but nothing too shocking. The graphics, though, need more polish as I keep finding low resolution textures and flat looking models all around the game, aggravated by the game’s view which is always pointing towards the ground.\r\nTalking about the isometric view, it’s a double edged sword. It provides a challenge to the player with its limited view adds uniqueness and personality, but sometimes It can be a detriment to the gameplay and it's not a nice fit to some of the puzzles and stealth sections of the game, constantly blocking views and important puzzle solving elements.\r\nWhen you're not solving puzzles in In Nightmare, you are running or sneaking away from enemies. The stealth mechanic is simple and straightforward, based in line of sight and hearing where you need to crouch instead of running. There are also audio and visual cues depending on how close the enemy is in spotting you. It is largely intense and this hide-and-seek gameplay element mostly fits the game’s childly nightmarish tone and atmosphere. Even with the lack of manual saves, I didn’t find it annoying to die or fail, which means the checkpoint system they made is well designed and reliable for the players.\r\nTo sum it up, In Nightmare is an average but still enjoyable sub 10 hour atmospheric experience for those looking for a decent puzzle and stealth gameplay encased in a childly nightmarish tone.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3468831) Originally posted on TapTap.",

You design gadgets here, taking out parts from the drawers, pulling tools visible from the sides, placing and connecting many different components and editing their properties in order to produce an output that you desire.\r\nThe components in Retro Gadgets — essentially the building blocks of your gadgets — are divided into four simple groups. Boards, Inputs, Outputs and Misc. Boards are what contains and forms the shape of your gadget. Inputs on the other hand are the buttons, knobs, or controls that can send signals, while Outputs are usually what displays the end result of a process such as LEDs, screens, or indicators. Lastly, Miscellaneous are just the rest of the components combined, one of the important ones being processors such as CPU and Audio processors.\r\nYou can customize the gadget by selecting the different tools in the game. For example, you can use the airbrush tool to customize the color of the different buttons, chassis, etc. down to the minute detail. It reminds me of MS Paint the way you use the airbrush tool and the way the game’s pixel art style presents itself. You can also use the Soldering Iron to weld different boards and chassis together to form bigger compartments and areas to build into.\r\nHow your gadget functions is entirely up to your design, more specifically, your code that the gadget runs and the one that controls its inputs and outputs. It uses a real life programming language — LUA — in its interface and is a big bonus for those looking to add an additional real life skill to their repertoire.\r\nAt the same time it's also a fitting game for the more seasoned programmers looking to design cool electronic gadgets without going through the hassle of soldering, electronics — all the complicated stuff — as well as costing you virtually zero. All this means is that Retro Gadgets is practically well tailored to both newbie and veteran programmers alike.\r\nAs you become more acquainted with Retro Gadgets, you will discover and realize it is possible to make more complex contraptions and you might even get addicted to building stuff, where it invokes a feeling similar to games like Factorio or Minecraft, albeit in a more grounded setting. Although for me, the coding environment given to you in-game is a bit limited, with the game's pixelated nature limited the amount of code you can see on the screen at the same time.\r\nAside from coding, you can also create pixel art to use as outputs or sprites. Or you can just print and use them as a sticker design for your gadget. You can also just straight up design gadgets visually, forgoing all the functionality and complex programming and focusing on enjoying just the artistic element of it. Retro Gadgets is a sandbox game after all.\r\nRealism wise it is pretty much detached from reality as far as electronics go. As an Electronics Engineer myself, it “gamifies” the gadget building part a lot; for example, the Soldering Iron in the game is used for welding boards and gadget chassis together, very distant from its real use of bonding electronic contact joints together. This is not a bad thing though: Retro Gadgets isn’t a simulator, it is a cool sandbox game that just so happened to have been inspired by building electronics and retro gadgets.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3490460) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "From the makers of the amazing Warhammer: Vermintide series comes another game, now set 40,000 years into the future: Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. This only means stuff like Guns and Chainswords are now available in your arsenal. The gameplay style that started with Left 4 Dead, the first person melee combat perfected by Vermintide, is now circling back to using guns again with Darktide.\r\nRight off the bat I’m gonna say that Darktide feels like a reskin of Vermintide, and that’s not a bad thing. The Vermintide series is phenomenal and “porting” it to the 40k universe was pretty much expected as soon as the Vermintide series took off..\r\nBasically the whole gameplay of Darktide is you and three other players are placed in a semi-linear map, set within the vast Hive City of Tertium, with multiple objectives to complete. While mobs and hordes of deranged human beings, influenced by evil forces, swarm upon you.\r\nYou play as a very lucky wrongdoer, a criminal of sorts, by chance, enlisted by the Imperium to do a suicide squad type of mission along with other unfortunates. This is essentially the entire premise of Darktide. Unlike in Vermintide or Left 4 Dead, where you have a selection of distinct characters to choose from, here you can have customizable characters, with four different classes available with their own different skills and abilities.\r\nDarktide’s gameplay has an amazing dynamic between gunplay and melee combat. Both are executed splendidly, but the melee combat still shines. The gunplay did not completely depreciate the value of melee combat, it merely enhanced it. The high-voltage dynamic of using guns then suddenly switching to a big ass Power Sword to mow down mobs upon mobs of enemies is never a dull moment to me. I did find that some guns are a bit underwhelming to me in terms of stopping power, especially up close. It lacks weight to it, hits are stiff and lethargic, It needs more kinetics.\r\nThe addicting gameplay loop on the other hand, remains the same in Darktide. Start with basic gear, then acquire more decent gear thanks to grinding with a bit of RNG, then acquire even more better gear. After the end of each mission, you get loot boxes and currency in order to get better gear or try out others There is a contract system, where you can take contracts to finish a selection of quests to get an additional guaranteed gear at the end. The first few hours of the game are undoubtedly the most boring parts, but as you grow your powers and gear, the fun kicks in.\r\nNow it's fun and you’ve clocked in multiple hours now, but another problem emerges: Map and mission variety are definitely the weakest points of the game. They are pretty monotonous and too similar looking. It gets repetitive pretty much quickly when you pay attention to it.\r\nFortunately, Darktide is fun enough in co-op mode that you tend to forget the repetitiveness. The fun factor and the gameplay loop carries this game heavily. Hopefully, as with what happened with their previous titles, they can add more varied content in the future and make it deeper.\r\nAside from the aforementioned suicide squad type of premise and outside the long and drawn out prologue + tutorial, there’s no comprehensive plot at this point, with the developers intending to flesh it out via as a live service element, serving as a overarching meta plot to continue evolving alongside future content and patches.\r\nOptimization wise, it performed badly on my decent 6 core 12 thread setup with an RTX 3080, and I occasionally experienced crashes which hurt my enjoyment, especially since it's a multiplayer game and you’re playing with other players. Even just quitting the game sometimes will still display a crashed error.\r\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide is a great 4-player co-op action with a great mash-up of gunplay and melee combat action, with an addicting gameplay loop that gets better in time. Only hampered by its repetitive nature in map and mission variety, and its poor performance and optimization; it is still a worthy game to try out, especially with groups of like-minded friends looking to play the next Left 4 Dead or Vermintide archetype game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3501269) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The heir apparent to the Dead Space series is now here. The Callisto Protocol is a great game and a worthy spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it's sadly disappointing to have such major performance issues on PC. With the full remake of the original Dead Space looming on the horizon, its now or never for The Callisto Protocol to impress us.\r\nThe Callisto Protocol starts off piling cliches upon cliches of typical action and sci-fi tropes. You play as the typical menial pilot turned wrongfully accused prisoner — caught in the middle of a viral outbreak on a colony on Europa’s Moon, Callisto. A stellar premise to start, setting the stage for the game.\r\nCallisto Protocol immediately sets the tone right from the start. With a brooding atmosphere, cheap jump scare, and an introduction to its gruesome melee combat. During the first few bits of the game, The melee combat is given its own spotlight, and this is where Callisto Protocol is at its best as a survival horror game. Later on in the game, you will get traditional ranged weaponry with guns that you can upgrade, and eventually a gravity bending tool called Grip.\r\nCompared to Dead Space, the melee combat in Callisto Protocol is given more emphasis and is highly encouraged. Aside from conserving ammunition, there is a satisfying pay off when risking melee combat over guns. Consecutive melee combos allows you to do auto aimed critical gunshot hits to quickly finish off enemies. There is also a bit of a semi-complex two directional dodge system: dodge left or right like boxer, then counter attack with a melee strike, which is pretty satisfying and gratifying to perform.\r\nThat's now to say the controls itself are without its issues. While the dodges empower you with a greater sense of control, there are some frustrations brought forth by very slow weapons switching or reloading animations that don't exactly line up well with the relentless enemy attacks you are up against.  Leading to unnecessary do-overs of actions you want to perform or worse, a do-over of the entire segment by dying. You also tend to have problems when dealing with multiple enemies at once and it seems like Callisto Protocol works best in 1v1 situations.\r\nAcross the game, you will get a hold of the tool “GRIP'' which functions similarly to KINESIS from Dead Space, or the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2. Pull objects or enemies into you and throw them off. In combination with the deliberately placed environmental hazards like random wall spikes or unsafe space machinery, that you encounter in the game's expansive and varied but linear levels, makes for a fun physics driven combat. It's a game changing mechanic and one that is too overpowered can render the rest of your arsenal obsolete when it comes to dealing with the weaker enemies. It makes it feel like a whole different kind of game, removing the tension and becoming a full-on action game suddenly.\r\nCallisto Protocol is a tense and anxiety inducing game, from the subtle sound effects emanating from the environment, dynamic blood effects splattering all over your prison coveralls, dark brooding hallways, gruesome kill animations, to the incessant use of jump scares. The graphics look phenomenal, the photorealism is done accurately and is undoubtedly a next-gen quality game. Some character models may look like plastic at times but for the most part they look very realistic.\r\nDespite running relatively smooth for the console platforms, the PC optimization is shit, for a lack of a better word. It really needed more time in the oven as the game is stuttery even with the highest of specs. I have an RTX 3080 and still struggle to maintain 60fps.  Lengthwise, expect the entire campaign to last you in a little bit under ten hours.\r\nWhile I feel that the story, atmosphere, and gameplay are entertaining enough and the graphics genuinely next-gen, there is really nothing new to it as a game. From the narrative tropes to the gameplay elements, everything in it feels like something I've already seen before.  Nothing really blew my mind nor met my somewhat high expectation for this game. Crippled even further by a stuttery PC performance, It’s not the masterpiece I originally thought it was, notwithstanding, The Callisto Protocol is still a great game at its best and an average game at its worst.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3527801) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It is a full blown high-profile Marvel game packing a roster that features popular Marvel characters including Iron Man, Captain America, Doctor Strange, Wolverine, Spider-Man and The Hulk. As well as including less-known characters like Nico Minoru and Magik. All of these characters are fighting in a high-stakes interpersonal story involving the demon  Lilith, the military organization Hydra, as well as throwing other heroes and villains into the mix.\r\nA couple of hours in, and I already dare say that Midnight Suns is a better Avengers game than the actual Marvel's Avengers game we got two years ago. With an innovative combat system, intriguing story, and a densely packed narrative with a novel’s worth of character development.\r\nMarvel’s Midnight Suns allows you to create your own blank slate character nicknamed “The Hunter”. Customize his or her appearance and over the course of the game, personalize his abilities and build relationships with the different Marvel characters. This plays out similarly to Mass Effect’s Commander Shepard, or Dragon Age: Origin’s The Warden.  You can also customize the Marvel heroes appearances by unlocking cosmetics via exploration of the game’s hub level “The Abbey”, the team’s secret castle base. An unexpected element for a comic book video game, almost borderlining the realm of fan-fiction and fan service, where you can create your own person and meet your favorite superheroes and save the day.\r\nHere’s where I think it gets a little alienating for many potential players: the turn based combat system. It also features the rather unconventional mixing of card based game mechanics and turn-based XCOM-esque gameplay where positioning and the environment also matters.\r\nThe turn-based gameplay of Midnight Suns is beautifully done. At first I thought it was gonna be an JRPG turn-based combat, where the characters just stand in place taking turns to attack, but I was surprised at its energetic manner, interactivity with the environment, and the mobility offered to the combatants. It does a great job of translating that kinetic superhero fight set pieces that we are all familiar with and love, into turn-based format. You can throw stuff to enemies, punch them through the environment, and use it to your advantage.\r\nCard system of Midnight Suns is commonly frowned upon based on early audience impressions, but I found it growing over me, it is even more fun and sustainable than traditional turn-based combat systems. The random nature of giving you random cards every fight keeps it fresh. It doesn't make me min-max my approach and doesn’t make me stick to the best skill combo available ever which inadvertently hurts the experience. This is saying a lot since the campaign can take more than a whopping 50 hours to finish and this card system is a literal savior in dealing with repetitiveness.\r\nThe character relationship and narrative part, again, is surprisingly good and expansive. In fact it even roughly comprises 70% of the game with only 30% being the actual combat gameplay.  It's ridiculous how narrative and character driven this game is and I’m saying that as a positive.\r\nWith over 60,000 lines of dialogue in Midnight Suns, there are tons of dialogue and conversation paths that you can take with the characters and the story. You are literally the glue of the team and everyone’s friend in this game. As said earlier, bearing many parallels to the Mass Effect series.\r\nI do appreciate that all of the Marvel characters, popular or not, are represented very well in the story and gameplay. With their own moments to shine as well as accurately capturing their fighting styles, animations, mannerisms, and quips during fights.\r\nA truly superb addition to the Marvel video game collection, It caught me off guard of how narrative driven it is, as well as the surprisingly fun and engaging combat that exceeded all my expectations. Basically everything in Marvel’s Midnight Suns surprised me in a good way, and it’s definitely one of the better titles to come out this year.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3535615) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Need for Speed is back, and it's back in style. Its newest game, Need for Speed: Unbound takes us to Lakeshore City. Here, street racing, drifting, and NOS usage reign supreme, in which the local cops are actively trying to stop.\r\nThe unnamed protagonist of the singleplayer campaign is a newcomer just as we are — the players, along with him are two supporting characters in Jasmine and Rydell, all eager to make a name for themselves. It all changes when the story switches gear from a kid in a new town to a cliche revenge story, serving as the main driver of the plot and an excuse for you to race around and climb to the top. It feels very much like Fast and Furious and I like it. Even the dialogue and all the radio banter from the police and other characters while racing.\r\nThe gameplay is just a traditional arcade racer with an arcade style control and drifting. There is nothing really special to it. Need for Speed: Unbound features a collection of over 140 cars that you can collect and customize using your hard earned cash. The race types in the game are pretty standard for the genre, with sprint races, drift challenges, street circuits, etc. There are also cop chases determined by your heat or “wanted” level and the cops patrol the streets across both day and night cycles.\r\nNeed for Speed: Unbound also gives us a wide range of accessibility settings when it comes to vehicle control and handling to better improve the gameplay to our personal preferences. Options such as traction control, steering sensitivity, downforce, and grip are entirely tunable. Additional accessibility settings also include customization of what's called “Driving Effects”, which is a new addition to the series and in my knowledge, the genre as a whole.\r\nDriving Effects are the beautifully well crafted anime / graffiti style effects that come out of the car — or transform it completely — that adds visual flavor and personality to the gameplay. Drifting effects, tire smokes, nitrous oxide boosts, flying car stunts, collisions, and many more in-game effects are made alive and kicking with this new addition.\r\nThe art style induced by this new creative direction is a bit jarring, the realistic models and lighting of the environment and the vehicles doesn't quite jibe in nicely with the cell shaded textures as well as the anime style character models. I feel that the developers weren’t quite ready yet to fully switch to this cell shaded aesthetic. This resulted into a weird middle ground between photorealism and cell shaded art style. Kind of left at an uncanny valley. if you find it a bit disorienting, you can still turn off the effects or at least turn it down, but the cel shaded nature of some aspects like pedestrians or the characters are entirely permanent.\r\nThere is an entirely separate multiplayer mode in Need for Speed: Unbound, with its own online character, progression, gameplay, and activities to do. In online free roam, which is only set in the day, there are the usual activities like events, playlists, speedruns, speed traps, drift zones, jumps, and collectibles to do, As well as hanging out with other players roaming in the city.\r\nI find it unfortunate and disappointing that they weren’t able to mix the two game modes and somehow share progression. On the bright side, you can entirely skip the campaign altogether and jump straight into multiplayer mode with your own character, especially if you are playing with friends.\r\nTo sum it up, Need for Speed: Unbound is a much appreciated rejuvenation for the Need for Speed series. Giving it a new paint job and a memorable personality to boot. It still plays like the old Need for Speed games, but now made fresh by its new art direction. The complete separation of multiplayer and singleplayer modes is a huge let down, but you can just look at it as having two different games rolled into one package.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3557370) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "It may seem like SYNCED is just another typical multiplayer out of thousands in an already heavily saturated market, but for me this game is really cooking something special. Imagine a cooperative / PvP looter shooter, rogue-lite, pokemon-symbiote game in a Skynet meets Zombies premise.\r\nFirst off, the background story and the lore: SYNCED (formerly titled SYNCED: Off-Planet) takes you into a post-apocalyptic world where advanced nanomachines have conquered the world and turned most humans into zombie-like nano creatures. There is a big plot exposition dump at the introduction where a barrage of world ending news reports bombard you with all the necessary details. Honestly it was all too interesting to ignore but was disappointingly overlapped too much to be able to pay attention to.\r\nThe survivors have banded into a resistance, forming a home base called Haven, fighting the “nanos” and are trying to clear them out run after run, area after area, grabbing gear and upgrades along the way. These player-controlled runners are the different pre-made distinct characters available to be selected, with their own personalities, skills, abilities, and cosmetics; focusing on different aspects like healing, damage, support, etc. While in Haven, you can also upgrade, customize your weapons using in-game currency as well as add attachments and effect modifiers.\r\nThese aforementioned runs form the core of SYNCED’s gameplay, where runs involve clearing out time based increasingly difficult nano-infested segments or “missions”. Culminating in a bullet sponge-attack telegraphing boss fight at the end, completing the mission will give you rewards plus experience on top of obtained loot. Across the semi-open world segments are random loot drops and minor areas with low level bosses that can be cleared. The whole mission layout felt simple enough but with filled with adequate content to offer variety.\r\nSYNCED is truly online-only as far as I know, with no option of offline play. But I have give to credit to the developers for introducing proper preservation of mission progression. I’ve had a few instances where I had to quit the game while in the middle of a run, but was surprised to return in-mission when I reloaded the game. No need to restart the whole run.\r\nThe gunplay is very satisfying and feels like a proper AAA game. I also have tried a controller and preliminary support is great, with correct prompts and auto-aiming already baked in. The melee is mechanically enjoyable as well, providing players with a simple hack and slash-esque combat further enhanced by your own nano abilities. In addition, the metallic sounding effects of hitting the nano creatures are too gratifying and a nice contradiction from the gory meaty sound effects from all the zombie killing games we’ve played.\r\nAfter your first low level boss kill in a run, you can “sync” with it, basically absorbing its nanites, forming it into your own symbiote-like companion out of four available types. To describe it best, it's just like pokemon; The nanites form into a companion of your choice, or you can return it to you in the form of an arm gauntlet which has its own passive effects and abilities when it's attached on you instead of deployed as a companion. It is amazing to witness your companions duking it out with other nanos, protecting you as well as aiding you in inflicting damage. SYNCED also has minor rogue-lite elements where you can unlock temporary skills upgrades, modifiers, or behaviors out of two random options at a time.\r\nFor a game still in beta, SYNCED already packs a lot of stuff and feels polished enough to play. The gameplay elements are already refined and enjoyable this early. The graphics are impressive enough and it ran a consistent 100+ fps on my system without any performance issues. It is definitely a game oozing with potential and deserves to be on your watchlist. SYNCED will be available for an Open Beta test starting on December 10 and ends on January 15.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3577580) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dodge ‘em up is a genre entirely new to me, and so far I like the concept. Swordship is one such game, it takes the notion of shoot ‘em up but removes the shooting part and makes the fundamental gameplay all about the art of dodging and deception.\r\nYou are a Swordship pilot, trying to steal and smuggle supplies from megacities hoarding them in the face of a post apocalyptic water world. Delivering these stolen supplies to those unfortunates living outside the megacities.\r\nSwordship’s gameplay is pretty basic but unique. Zip through the various randomly generated express water transport lanes — complete with dynamic weather — stealing and redirecting important goods. All while avoiding dangerous security measures the megacities put in place. Lasers, turrets, bombers, mines, all of these bullet hell producing mechanics are out to obliterate you in one shot. Aside from positional movement, you can also dive down in the river as an additional dodge maneuver, and very much makes it a somewhat engaging 2.5D game.\r\nYour Swordship doesn’t come equipped with guns or missiles, and all you can do is avoid these projectiles and explosions, or tricking them to make them destroy each other: Have two turrets point to each other, then dodge at the very last moment to make them shoot each other, or trick enemy air support into a friendly fire of bombarding cannons; High risk, high reward — The anxiety level is high with Swordship, especially when doing the last split-second maneuvers, dives, and experiencing near misses, complete with occasional slow motion effects. You can very easily die in a heartbeat.\r\nIt’s not all too difficult though as you can select between 6 different Swordships that can be upgradable with various skills and power ups that can change the tide. For example, The EMP blast that can disable everything, it can certainly help you escape hellish situations and give you breathing room. The enemies also telegraph their attacks cleanly and with enough practice, you can clearly see and anticipate them amidst all the bullet hell and visual clutter.\r\nSwordship also features rogue-lite elements. At the end of every level, you are scored and given options as to which upgrade to install. Increase your score, or add to your extra life. Add modifiers that can help you with your run such as increasing pick-up times, drop rates, or explosions that clear the path when doing a required combo. When you die, there is a quick restart system which is a nice convenience, especially when you’re frustrated enough with all the deaths. When all your extra lives are spent, you restart over without all the upgrades.\r\nThe art style and sound design of Swordship is admirably cool and flashy. The beautiful aesthetics of the smoke effects, speed trails, and explosions fully fits the game’s frantic gameplay, not to mention the artistic slo-mo shot whenever you perform a sick move, all of it adding a great deal to the game’s charisma.\r\nSwordship is fun enough to keep you invested for 10 hours to fully unlock everything, and more if you absolutely enjoy the anxiety-inducing risky rewarding gameplay it banks itself on. Highly recommended for Shoot’ em up fans especially those looking to explore further evolutions of the genre.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3594181) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Hello Neighbor 2 largely maintains the same formula, improving many mechanics from the first game but at the same time never really getting rid of the frustration factor.\r\nHello Neighbor 2 takes us back to Raven Brooks in a sort of standalone story while still being a follow up to the original game story wise. You are a journalist who wants to investigate Mr. Peterson — poster boy for the whole game series and the original game’s villain — as a suspect in the disappearance of various children. Apart from him, the whole neighborhood is as suspicious too, warranting investigation as well.\r\nRight off the bat we’re given an unguided mini puzzle tutorial of sorts, setting the mood of the game. Across the whole 5-10 hour experience (depending on how fast you can solve the puzzles), You solve puzzles by primarily interacting with the environment in a first person view: Pushing buttons, pulling levers. Finding the missing key or figuring out the combination code for locked doors or containers.\r\nMost of the time, you are using keen environmental observation or just pure trial and error to figure out stuff. The platforming and wonky physics aspect of the first game are toned down as well, with more focus on actual interactable objects instead. You can now also easily vault over ledges and obstacles instead of just plain trying to jump over stuff.\r\nThe first few puzzles I encountered started off relatively easy and straightforward, very far from the vague and illogical puzzle solving of the first game. However, soon enough things get weird and vague once again and we’re back to the same frustrations we had with the first game. There is often not enough information given to the player on how to advance the game and as mentioned earlier it becomes a game of trial and error instead of something that rewards critical thinking.\r\nThe entirety of Hello Neighbor 2 takes place in the whole neighborhood instead of just Mr. Peterson’s house in the first game, requiring unsanctioned visits to other houses and places in the neighborhood — A huge up in scale from the last game. You now play hide and seek with different characters in the neighborhood, powered by a supposedly self learning AI that will adapt to your playstyle, for example by changing its routines to surprise you and your usual entry points or hiding spots. It also claims to use a neural network and algorithms to carve out a complex and dynamic experience for all players as they play and more information is gathered.\r\nUnfortunately, I never really noticed any cutting-edge in the AI and in my experience they are just your straight up conventional stealth game AI. One that you can easily cheese your way out into success. For example by just constantly abusing the closet or under-the-table hiding spots when they are about to spot you to break detection. Sometimes they even just stand around in one spot and bug out. It doesn’t help that the entire stealth mechanic itself, when your character is caught, isn't that punishing anyway: It just respawns you just outside the house and you can easily go back inside right away. The tension is gone and it again boils down to trial and error brute force gameplay.\r\nThe narrative of Hello Neighbor 2 isn’t exactly great and can be pretentious at times. It tries too hard to be too complex and deep. In the end it just all felt meaningless and fell flat on its face. The Art Design on the other hand is Pixar-esque impressive and is a nice fit for the family friendly horror game that it wants to be. A theme largely kept intact across the game series.\r\nIn my review for the first game, I talked about the missed opportunity of multiplayer, and hoped the sequel would have it. They finally made a multiplayer spin-off game with Secret Neighbor, in which unfortunately the sequel still didn’t have. Still, props to the developers for sticking to the single player formula with their mainline games.\r\nHello Neighbor 2 is still a family friendly puzzle stealth horror, with many gameplay improvements from the first game as expected for a sequel. If you loved the first game, good news is that it is largely the same, just improved upon. Regrettably — as with the first game — weak puzzle design, frustration woes, as well as the underachieving advanced AI stops it from being a great game overall.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3631325) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Nostalgia is a powerful thing, so powerful that the once bygone era of 16-bit video games is now back and currently an oversaturated market more than ever. Every once in a while though, you find a gem worth playing. This time, it's titled Chained Echoes, a nostalgic 16-bit JRPG game in a fantasy world where Dragons and Mechas exist.\r\nChained Echoes takes place on the continent of Valandis, a land teeming with magic and rich history, currently ruled by three warring kingdoms: Taryn, Escanya, and Garvos. Mostly set one year after a massive catastrophe resulting in heavy casualties for everyone, which forced all three kingdoms to sign a peace treaty. This is where the main characters come in, to stop an impending resurgence of the war and if possible, end it for good.\r\nChained Echoes’ lore is well detailed and attentively explained in the game, it got me hooked already in the first few minutes of playing. The worldbuilding is just masterfully done and you can tell that the writers put so much effort in it with the rich backstory of Valandis, its kingdoms, its people, the magic, and the technologies. Chained Echoes immediately makes you care about the characters with its humor-filled lighthearted dialogue, meaningful NPC interactions, a relatable down to earth premise, and an engaging balancing act between all the different characters.\r\nIf you liked the TV series Game of Thrones, then surprisingly Chained Echoes instills a similar vibe to it when it comes to Storytelling, at least for the first few hours that I've played. The way you go back and forth between different characters, and how they all feel like protagonists and main characters in their own rights. All with their own segments and moments to shine.\r\nChained Echoes is a beautiful game. The pristine 16-bit style coupled with the emotional soundtrack evokes heavy nostalgic feelings, even if I haven’t even played it before. It felt like I was back to SNES or PS1 days, while still experiencing something fresh and in some aspects, modern. Modern like the ultra smooth UI motions and camera panning, fittingly superimposed with the choppy 16-bit style animations.\r\nThe battles are handled in a traditional JRPG turn-based system but are not instanced into another battle screen, they still happen in the same area you are roaming around, just with somewhat repositioned characters.\r\nVariety wise, every character has their own set of skills with Active, Passive, and Stats. And they are unlockable using Grimoire Shards, something that is earned after every battle and is fundamentally a substitute for non-existent level-up and experience system.\r\nThere is a slight new twist in the combat, with Chained Echoes’ Overdrive system. One that you may need to balance and maintain or suffer heavy penalties. Use certain attacks and skills and it can push the Overdrive bar into the green zone where you have the most bonuses and positive effects.\r\nPush it a bit too far, and it will overheat and punish you with additional damage from enemies. Using too few of them will cause you to “underheat” go back to the green zone, or even undershoot it and back to the yellow area.\r\nAll HP and TP (Mana) is reset after each battle, which gave me a mixed feeling: It's a nice convenience not having to conserve your TP,  going on a skills galore not holding anything back, Along with not having to maintain your HP throughout multiple battles. But it eliminates any challenging survival elements while progressing in the story. Just win the battle and everyone is fully restored.\r\nMy only gripe thus far with Chained Echoes is how new information is presented to you, mainly the game mechanics and how it tutors you. Plastering you with big walls of texts explaining the control scheme, or how a game mechanic works. It didn’t help that the game is already text heavy with its dialogues because of the non-existent voice acting. A “show, don’t tell” approach would have been way better.\r\nIn my first few hours of Chained Echoes, I can positively say that it is a masterclass example in worldbuilding and storytelling. A shining example of how 16-bit JRPGs still have a place in this modern gaming world. A powerful game that will invoke heavy nostalgia feelings while still delivering a fresh experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3658526) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "IXION is a new science fiction space opera, wrapped in a game where you need to manage your state of the art colony ship “Tiqqun”. To ensure the survival of humanity amidst the treacherous nature of space, and maybe explore the cosmos and find a new habitable planet for them to colonize.\r\nIXION starts off on a high note, with a Hollywood level production value for its visually stunning presentation that is sustained throughout the whole game. Being a space exploration enthusiast myself, I got goosebumps at the introduction sequence with its grand premise and a matching angelic musical score. It honestly felt like a proper Hollywood opener, and not one that would typically open a PC colony sim game.\r\nCompared with other contemporaries, even with its inspiration Frostpunk, IXION is heavily narrative-driven. With an engaging storyline that will keep you at the edge of your seat and in some measure — barring any spoilers — both a scary and fascinating premise driving the story forward.\r\nIXION starts out pretty slowly, correctly taking its time introducing the game mechanics bit by bit during the roughly 30 minute tutorial aboard the Tiqqun: your Colony Ship. There is a bit too much filler dialogue at times, especially when I just wanted to learn and play. Fortunately all of the dialogue is regrettably skippable. The real-time pausable strategy set up is neatly divided into three different views: Interior, Exterior, and System View.\r\nInterior View is the closest comparison to Frostpunk, where you are free to build structures like Crew Quarters, Infirmary, or Stockpile Areas, in a 3D grid layout. All inside the hull of your torus-shaped colony ship. These hull interiors are evenly divided into 6 segments, with only 1 segment available at the start.\r\nExterior View is more of an upfront management of your whole colony ship including building outside structures like solar panels, engines, ship upgrades, or performing hull repairs.\r\nSystem View on the other hand zooms out and shows the whole planetary system overview. It focuses on exploration, resource gathering, and investigation. The systems are filled with visible and hidden points of interest available for you to check out and find using smaller ships and probes. Basically anything that happens outside the colony ship is done here.\r\nSome of these aforementioned events comes with their own mini quest lines complete with multiple choices and paths to take, with potential consequences. This reminds me of the exploration aspect of the space RTS game Stellaris. It provides some nice role-playing / storytelling elements that makes IXION more than just a numbers game that you need to balance.\r\nThe whole set-up of IXION is a carefully balanced cycle of problem-solving and satisfaction. The gameplay loop requires the balancing of resources like power, materials, and food. Selecting what structures to build, and what technology to prioritize researching. All of it amounts to a challenging and satisfying big picture puzzle that you can solve, or your whole crew can die trying. I never really felt any frustration while playing it — only challenged — which is a great thing for IXION.\r\nAside from colony management and exploration, there are also social and civil matters to be decided in IXION, ala Frostpunk. There will be civil challenges and unforeseen events presented to you in-game, where you are responsible for assessing and managing your risks. Decide accordingly for your people. It adds gravitas to IXION and again adding some nice role-playing / storytelling elements.\r\nAs someone who loved the game Frostpunk, I see a lot of glaring similarities. That’s not to say that IXION is a ripoff, but more off just heavily inspired, taking many amazing bits from all of our loved RTS and Space strategy games and crafts it into its own amazing space colony survival game.\r\nPerformance wise, it performed very smoothly without any issues on my 6-core 12-thread setup with an RTX 3080, while still looking visually stunning graphically. And supporting even a niche 32:9 resolution.\r\nIXION is Filled with many intricate details from the smallest buildings, to the grandiose looking ship exterior and planetary view, as well as the melancholic cinematic cutscenes when your Tiqqun is moving about.\r\nIXION has managed to pull off a compelling colony sim, complete with consequential political and social elements on top of an engaging story, propelling the genre into new celestial heights.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3641421) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Glide your way into a satisfying melancholic lightshow in style. Solar Ash’s artistic style is as joyfully vibrant as it is depressingly dark, as you journey through and across space and time inside a blackhole called the Ultravoid.\r\nThe entire premise of Solar Ash is a surreal experience, part science fiction, part imaginative fantasy. The story of Solar Ash is just as strong as its artistic style. Widely gripping and entertaining. Lighthearted, but tragic. You control Rei, a member of a group of voidrunners who has entered inside a blackhole. The mission is to destroy it using an experimental technology to save their planet from getting sucked into the blackhole and destroyed.\r\nIts sci-fi elements are quietly referenced throughout the narrative, with mentions of advanced technology, government and civilizations, and artificial intelligence. But its fantasy elements are more evident as you skate throughout the colorful desolate landscape populated by otherworldly creatures and beings, a surreal chaotic representation of an inside of a blackhole when concepts such as time and space are warped and the lines between reality and dreams are blurred.\r\nThe story sets up the core gameplay, you roam around in skates and investigate the land, what happened to the other voidrunners, and how to activate the experimental technology — called the starseed — in order to stop the blackhole.\r\nSolar Ash’s movement system is all too satisfying and it never really felt like a chore to do. You just hold a button to skate, press another button to boost and another button to jump. There is also an attack button used to clear out the anomalies, destroy scattered caches, and destroy randomly wandering inconsequential enemies. You can also temporarily enter a slow motion state in order to give you time to aim and reach farther objectives.\r\nThis is Spider-Man all over again, in which the movement system is so fun and cool that you never really see the need for fast travel or ever get bored while traveling. In fact, I can just enjoy gliding around randomly without even going for objectives.\r\nThe chaotic apocalyptic landscape also sets up the platforming aspect of Solar Ash. You will need to race and jump around in order to reach various areas, sometimes requiring speed and precision in anticipation of incoming hazards. For example, you may need to move fast because the black goo you are climbing on will overheat in a few seconds and destroy you, or you may need to jump precisely or you will fall to your death instead.\r\nThese are all but mini-challenges in the game that ultimately culminates into some sort of a boss fight to finally clear an anomaly. Where you need to grapple and jump on top of a massive anomaly, a titan-like creature called a Remnant. They’re so big that you can skate on its body, be it its extensive back or its gigantic arm. The boss fight mechanic largely keeps the same format as the mini challenges, move fast and avoid all the nasty surfaces, destroying the sub-anomalies along the way until you clear the big one at the end.\r\nSolar Ash’s movement system blends so well with the puzzle platformer elements set in place. The added time trial aspects requiring you to be in your absolute best speed in order to clear out objectives enhances the experience and turns it from a relaxing chilling experience to one that is frantic and stressful when needed.\r\nSolar Ash is truly one of the most mesmerizing experiences I’ve had all year. It’s masterful trio of narrative, art style and gameplay makes it a worthwhile play, comfortably beatable in under 10 hours.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3689574) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "You are fresh out of high school; no job, no experience, no goals in life. Intergalactic aliens invade and want to get high off of humans. You stumble upon a sentient talking pistol. What do you do? Why not hunt them for bounties, with firepower assistance from an arsenal of talking guns. High on Life is a new crazy game from the creator of the animated TV series Rick and Morty, that is literally high on all fronts; talking self-aware guns, weirding looking aliens to slaughter in style, and unfiltered abusive dialogue.\r\nHigh on Life’s satirical attempt at entertainment is not for everyone. It’s mature-rated. It’s very disturbing, there isn’t even an ounce of seriousness in this self-aware comedy FPS game, and sometimes you can forget that it’s a video game and just want to listen to the highly subjective hilarious dialogues and interactions.\r\nOne of the high points of the game is the talking guns, each of the four distinct guns with their own voice actor and personalities that react to different situations and decisions that you find yourself in. A humorous gun that makes witty remarks, or even a psychotic deranged knife that wants to kill everyone on sight, even friendlies. Every gun has something different to say in every situation, which adds a lot of flavor and variety to the game’s charm. Fortunately, there is an option to change how frequently the guns speak, if you find them talking excessively.\r\nHigh on Life is unhinged, you can literally go postal in this game; Kill civilians, innocent bystanders, or even lowkey force you to kill an annoying alien kid. Dialogue choices and an unshackled approach to many situations lets you participate in the absurdness of this game. Just got a new knife from a weapons dealer? Kill the dealer. Encounter a bunch of construction workers on your way to the objective? kill them all for no reason. High on Life just doesn’t care. And just to be clear, most of these aren’t your objectives, this is just something that you are given freedom to do in the game, a privilege usually not given in other titles.\r\nThe free flowing FPS combat of High on Life is fun and dynamic. It reminded me of the underrated game Bulletstorm. Your weapons, and abilities are varied and interesting in their own ways that you are fascinated — to the point of being encouraged — to use them all and mix them into different combos and cool maneuvers. You have jetpacks, grappling hooks, discs that you can shoot and bounce around enemies and deflect them back like Captain America, a grenade that launches enemies into the air, and many more. It starts off a little slow in the first few hours, but once weapon and enemy variety gets diverse enough, the fun kicks in.\r\nAcross your sub twenty-hour bounty hunting journey in High on Life, you will visit many varying locations across the cosmos; futuristic cities, slums, lush jungles, and even desert wastelands. Metroidvanian platformer mechanics are sprinkled all over the level designs.  Because of the platforming elements as well as your movement abilities, the Boss fights are also Metroidvanian, they shoot and throw projectiles at you that actually requires skill and dodging. This is a welcome mechanic instead of the usual bullet sponge bosses or boring QTEs that most mainstream FPS games have.\r\nBetween High on Life’s highly kinetic FPS carnage and unhinged dialogue lies a highly divisive game you will either hate or love so much depending on your humor tastes. If you do like the absurdist humor style of Rick and Morty, this is a game that won’t disappoint.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3735391) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Ever watched a slice-of-life anime and wished “I would love to be transported to that world and just live in peace”? Well, this brand new game titled Aka can allow you to virtually fulfill that wish. You can go on an adventure, explore the world, or maybe just settle peacefully and find inner peace.\r\nThe war is over, the fight is over. Our character, the red panda Aka, is a former participant of that war. He has been invited by a good friend over to his place — Pine Island — to start a new peaceful life. Upon arrival, Aka is welcomed by this friend Thom, who helps him gain his footing in this new island.\r\nIn Aka, you are free to explore everything right from the start, even the other islands surrounding Pine Island. There are no barriers or restricted areas. There is no overarching linear story that will push the gameplay forward. It’s up to you to find something to do.\r\nThroughout the world, you will meet many characters — Anthropomorphic animals like the main character — many of them impacted by the recent war and might need your assistance via light puzzle elements and some fetching and questing.\r\nThere are also some mini-games that you can encounter with the characters and play. Such as this musical rhythm mini-game.\r\nDespite Aka’s pro-peace advocacy, It's a low-key traumatic and softly depressing on the inside. With frequent references to the previous war, mentions of fighters not coming back, remembering lost friends, orphaned children, etc. It tells a valuable lesson on the horrible aftermath of war.\r\nAside from its exploration and anti-war elements, you are also free to farm in peace. Make a garden, craft some items, or just chill in the comfort of your home. It’s not too overly complex like many survival or farming sims out there, and that’s not a bad thing. Simple elements like having to use tools like axes and pickaxes, to farm materials, and use them to craft items. The controls are simplistic with basic movement and jump controls available, while interactions have a more of a point and click mechanism that will prompt you with what tool is available to use on that interaction.\r\nDespite the beautiful art style, cute characters, and relaxing scenery, the UI and the controls are unfortunately barebones in contrast. You would even think that the current state was just a temporary placeholder and the developers weren’t just able to properly update it in time. In this regard, Aka feels like an early access game, when in fact it's not.\r\nThe relaxing peaceful soundtrack on the other hand is just too comforting it almost brings tears to my eyes, right from the start it just captivated me all too well. I could see myself listening to the music even way past my playthrough of this game. Aka wants to make me fall asleep, perhaps a little bit too well. And kind of I’m saying that as a compliment.\r\nThere is no dialogue, so expect a bit of light reading for the conversations. I would say it is a wasted opportunity. For a game that is as calming as this, I wouldn’t want to read anything more than a few words anymore, I just want my eyes to take a break from all the reading. Listening to voiced dialogue like some sort of a podcast or radio drama to relax, backdropped by the beautiful peaceful music would have been a nicer fit.\r\nExplore, Farm, Chill. Aka is a heartwarming game that will make you wish you could play it with your eyes closed and just relax, maybe fall asleep and chill along with your character.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3758384) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Almost every classic title nowadays is getting the remastered or remake treatment, and PSP’s 2007 title CRISIS CORE –FINAL FANTASY VII is no exception. With the release of Crisis Core - FINAL FANTASY VII– REUNION, we get a sort of a hybrid between a remaster and a remake, now available for PC, Xbox, Playstation, and the Nintendo Switch.\r\nCrisis Core - FINAL FANTASY VII– REUNION, or REUNION for short, brings in overhauled graphics and a more action-oriented gameplay. Bringing the 2007 classic much more in-line with the recent Final Fantasy VII Remake.\r\nWhile Final Fantasy VII Remake did shake up quite a few things by changing some of the storyline elements, REUNION keeps its plot the exact same as the original. Narrative wise, REUNION is just a remaster and focuses more on the visual and mechanical side of changes and improvements. The original voice actors have been replaced as well by the actors from the FF:VII Remake, bringing consistency to the voice acting of these recent classic remake / remasters.\r\nFor newcomers, it's the prequel to Final Fantasy VII and it is set seven years before the start of Final Fantasy VII up until its beginning. REUNION tells the story of Zack, a young soldier of the megacorporation Shinra Electric Company, caught in the middle of a war between Shinra and the western nation of Wutai. CRISIS CORE –FINAL FANTASY VII provides an intriguing backstory and an emotional story worthy to be experienced in its own right. Bringing in some rich history to the lore, fleshing out the main and supported characters, and providing motivation to both Sephiroth and Cloud as they appear in Final Fantasy VII.\r\nThe graphics look great as ever, making the in-game visuals almost in the same ballpark as, if not better than the original pre-rendered CG cutscenes for the PSP. All of which was largely kept intact — just updated with higher resolution. Aside from upgraded in-game visuals, Most of the in-game cutscenes are faithfully remade in this updated version. Retaining most of the same camera angles and animations. Sure, some of the animations did not age great, both that and the poor lip syncing looked a little stiff, but they’re a passable experience largely overshadowed by the otherwise technically impressive graphics and kinetic gameplay.\r\nThe combat is more action packed now, with more control over the camera thanks to the now standard dual analog stick controls. Due to a modernized gameplay and controller layout upgrades, the combat is now more kinetic; with faster attacks, more frequent need of dodges, and more flashy looking abilities. While gameplay elements like slot machine-like buff randomizer 'DMW System' are back and remain the same.\r\nThe twenty-hour campaign, plus the mission and level layout that are clearly designed to be played on the go with the PSP have remained unchanged in REUNION, for better or for worse. Personally, I didn’t not find this an issue and actually like the bite sized nature of the mission design.\r\nCrisis Core - FINAL FANTASY VII– REUNION is a great example of remake/remaster done right. It rides on the strong momentum of the recent Final Fantasy VII Remake and pushes it further. It modernizes the original PSP classic in just the right amount, makes it accessible to series newcomers while still offering a worthy revisiting for old timers and long time fans of the series.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3749916) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Where different aspects of our lives such as Tech, Food, Shopping, Money, Dating, Exercise and many others are beautifully represented into twenty different dreamy levels with their own distinct sequences, mechanics; complete with their own song and melody to harmonize with.\r\nMelatonin is not your typical rhythm game. There are no UI elements and button prompts. There are no overly complex gestures or an overwhelming number of buttons used. Instead, it uses clever visual and matching audio cues to assist the player in correctly pressing the needed button, sometimes it's just a single button, sometimes, just two directions.\r\nIt's a nice breath of fresh air from all the typical Rhythm games out there that relies heavily on brain twisting button mashing and flashy UI elements as their main gameplay mechanic. With Melatonin’s minimalistic approach, you truly feel like you are one with the beat and feel more connected to the music. It feels more like an experience instead of a game.\r\nAt first, the heavy reliance on visual and audio cues alone might make it seem hard and make you feel like you are either blind, deaf, or both. But when you get used to the song and its beat, it just becomes second nature. It really is a fun experience to listen to the song and when you play the song enough times, it all becomes muscle memory.\r\nThere are instances where the game will try to hide visual cues and force you to play by sound cues only, where it will certainly challenge you if you really are attuned to the melody.\r\nAccessibility wise, Melatonin gives you the option to do a quick practice session for every level to let you familiarize yourself with the beat and cues  — complete with buttons and directional prompts — before you actually play the level. If you still are having difficulties, there are a couple of accessibility options for you available, such as permanently turning on these aforementioned additional prompts, or adjusting the timing register of inputs.\r\nMelatonin is divided into 5 chapters called “nights” and each chapter comprises four distinct levels plus one final challenging level at the end — sort of like a boss fight. Which is basically all the previous four levels fused together, moving back and forth across them throughout the song.\r\nNot all that, as developers are kind enough to include a level editor in-game, greatly extending the longevity of Melatonin and providing us a way to use our creativity and make our own levels.\r\nWith its hand drawn light neon-centric art style and lo-fi dreamy soundtrack, Melatonin is a true evolution of the genre and a great mash up of visual and musical art that results in a fun and fresh rhythm game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3776220) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Slavic fairy tales, good and evil, and a first person archery survival adventure. The story behind the infamous Baba Yaga is explored in this new game titled Blacktail. You play as the teenage girl Yaga, trying to find his twin sister Zora and other children who have all gone missing.\r\nThe story is narrated by our main character Yaga as it happens, in other words, at the time of occurrence, which is an interesting design choice. It definitely helped the developers to relay to us useful gameplay information without only using meta elements like text or UI prompts. This is clearly evident with the early parts of the game, especially the tutorial section, where Yaga frequently speaks to herself in order to assist the player and provide minor plot exposition.\r\nThe writing as well as the voice acting in this game — especially with Yaga — is what impressed me the most. The storytelling is believable enough to be a bewitching origin story for the Baba Yaga, one that fits the slavic folklore profile that it is trying to adapt. Dark as expected, with heavy usage of Witchcraft, Monsters, and Spirits. The voice acting legitimately sounds like characters from a fairy tale book, like all them have come to life and read their own dialogue, telling a fairy tale story in front of the player.\r\nVery early in the game, you are immediately given a seemingly hard choice, the dark or the light. Any of which will supposedly have a lasting impact with the story. This is a bit misleading though and the writers could have been more clear with this part. As this is just a sneak peek of what is going to happen depending on your choices throughout the game and not really make a big impact as far as I know.\r\nThe story and gameplay are blended well in Blacktail and compliments one another. Aside from the engaging narration coming from Yaga as you play the game, you are also presented with a morality system that will determine your dialogue choices and provide you with different bonuses and even skills, depending on your moral stance. You can affect this stance by doing good deeds or bad deeds; such as freeing trapped birds, helping NPCs, or killing animals.\r\nAcross the game you will also meet various characters and creatures that will further define your character's morality. While the choices do matter in Blacktail, the story is not as dynamic as I expected, with some encounters resulting in all the same outcomes in the end, just with different explanations and motivations depending on your moral stance.\r\nBlacktail’s main gameplay focus is on its archery survival adventure throughout the open world forest, all in first person view. You can gather materials and craft them into items like potions for healing, or arrows for your bows. Hunt wild animals and gather resources to eat and survive. Find scattered treasures for additional loot. You will also unlock new witch powers and be able to cast spells by brewing and mixing different ingredients.\r\nThe combat of Blacktail felt slow and methodical. While those descriptions in itself aren't in any way indicative of a bad game, overall it was not engaging enough and I felt that it was too simplistic in its approach. Just shoot an enemy enough times and they’re dead, perhaps occasionally push them off with a spell or dash around to evade the already slow moving enemies.\r\nEven the boss fights are like this just with higher health and damage levels. If many games have a simplistic story that just serves to move the gameplay forward, Blacktail has a simplistic gameplay that is just there to push the interesting story forward.\r\nThe landscape is accurately made in a sense that it genuinely feels like it's from a fairy tale. Sometimes it is dark and murky. Sometimes it is lush and vibrant. Fantastical elements such as Magical talking creatures, giant insects, all co-exist with regular animals like birds and deer. Since it's open world, do expect a lot of walking and backtracking especially with the questing and the crafting system in place.\r\nBlacktail is a unique fresh take on a relatively unexplored mythology. Where your choices matter, but only slightly. And the gameplay — despite its best tries to be interesting — takes a backseat to the story.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3778257) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Valkyrie Profile has come a long way from its PS1 origins, its PSP re-release the Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the recent mobile ports, to now its modern PS4 and PS5 release.\r\nWhile there are multiple playable characters and party members in Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, you primarily control Lenneth, the primary protagonist and a lady warrior serving Odin, tasked with recruiting the Einherjar — fallen heroes who have died in battle — to fight in the impending Ragnarok. Concepts in which we all are too familiar with recent Norse mythology games like God of War, Assassin’s Creed, and even Valheim, coming out recently.\r\nValkyrie Profile: Lenneth has a very gripping and emotional story, one that deals with loss and despair, as well as hope and redemption. Since you are recruiting the Einherjar, all the characters you are trying to recruit need to have died in battle. Before they are recruited, the game shows you a short glimpse of the character’s life leading to their death.\r\nFailed heroes, betrayal, suicide, bad luck, and whole lot of other rather depressing topics are tackled in the story, if this still isn’t obvious, this game is not for the faint hearted.\r\nMost of the voice acting plus the heavily pixelated graphics hasn’t aged well by today’s standards, but it's not a big deal considering the amazing story and highly engaging gameplay you are offered.\r\nValkyrie Profile: Lenneth is divided into three core gameplay element. The 3D world-map where Lenneth flies over to choose where to go. The 2D dungeon platforming exploration, and the unique turn-based combat where both sides attack simultaneously during their turn.\r\nThe combat is highly engaging and surprisingly kinetic despite the turn based system. The simultaneous attack per party turn system works really well. It encourages synergistic combos between the different characters and reduces dull “strategic” moments in between attacks or turns. Each turn, there is a special meter that fills with each attack, and if filled in one turn — thanks to a great combo — it culminates in a special attack for anyone that participated in building it.\r\nValkyrie Profile: Lenneth for the Playstation 4 and 5 is basically the same PS1 game that fans know and love. For newcomers, this is one of the best PS1 games of all time. And It largely holds up thanks to its impressive storytelling and unique gameplay still relevant to this day thanks to the continued use of turn-based combat mechanics by the gaming industry.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3872282) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Depersonalization is a new anime-style tactical RPG recently released in Early Access today, and at its heart is an interesting story intertwined with a promising gameplay, both of which are immediately noticeably to be in the early stages of the development.\r\n## Pros\r\n- interesting story elements\r\n- a great mix of anime and pixel art\r\n- deep role playing mechanics\r\n- extremely high replayability## Cons\r\n-wonky software-translated text and voice-acting\r\nAt face value, Depersonalization’s aesthetics and general feeling unquestionably reminded me of the many anime visual novel games I’ve played before: the chilling soundtrack, the eerie anime art, the intriguing story elements, and the various choices you are presented in the game.\r\nAnime-wise, the art style is a mix of gothic, medieval, and noir. With heavy use of lovecraftian elements. However, behind all that impressive eye-candy is a game that is indeed an example of a true Early Access game, If I’m judging by its heavily unfinished state.\r\nCryptic storytelling\r\nThe story is told in multiple scenarios across time and different characters, but at the start, you play as Anan, getting a glimpse of his childhood days being restricted inside the castle, exploring the vicinity and his unusual experiences involving creepy supernatural and lovecraftian elements. Despite the medieval vibes, it is clearly set in the modern world because cars, roads, and modern tools already exist.\r\nThe cryptic storytelling is intriguing at most and confusing at its worst. Jumping across multiple timelines and characters. With the unconventional mixing of many elements such as blending in modern life with medieval life, as well as using complex existential themes such as space-time jumping, bending reality, otherworldly spirits, and lucid dreaming. All of it will probably result in a polarizing reception: It will either hook you immediately or make you confused real quick.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe main bulk of the gameplay is via exploration and free roam, interacting with objects and characters in the world. In almost every action that you do, there is a skill-check, if you’re familiar with the Call of Cthulhu RPG series of books, then it's something similar. Depersonalization focuses on skill-checks that affect the outcome of the dice rolls; Talking to people, checking out objects for clues, even the simple turn-based combat is highly dependent on the dice-rolls. Fail them and you can miss a clue, suffer stat penalties, or even be forced into combat.\r\nThe combat is a pretty straightforward turn-based system. Perform a basic attack, use skills and spells, or throw items. It's not the main focus of  Depersonalization, as many of the combat encounters are entirely avoidable if you are lucky enough to pass all the skill checks.\r\nJump across space and time\r\nEventually, you will unlock a space-time jumping element that is blended well with the replayability and save/load aspects of the game. Replayability is heavily emphasized in Depersonalization, combined with its core gameplay element being the skill checks and randomizer. Most times, you may need to replay a scenario again, better equipped with new items and higher skills to change outcomes and experience a different ending of that scenario. In which completing certain endings will reward you with persistent items you can use at your future playthroughs.\r\nAlong with the space-time jumping element, You will be able to create new characters called ‘investigators’, with their own stats, personality, and appearance. Allowing you to tailor an entirely specific character for a specific set of scenarios and play styles you want to do. All of the space-time actions such as reloading a save, or creating new characters, require points. Run out of points, and you end up deleting your current character and forcing you to bring in a new one.\r\nWith a focus on character development, choices, and dice rolls, Depersonalization is truly a dynamic game that will make the experience fresh and exciting at every playthrough of a scenario, and it's designed that way. Even the story is designed to go into multiple paths depending on your items, stats, and roll outcomes. As of now though, the story is currently splintered into different scenarios. In which more modules are planned in the future, as well as also letting players make their own and share it via the Steam Workshop.\r\nThe Language Barrier\r\nThere is an expansive dialogue already in-game, but its english localization is wonky with google translate levels of quality apparent in every line of dialogue. There’s voice-acting for the characters, but they’re all software generated and mainly robotic sounding. Still, it's commendable to include voice acting despite its current state, with every character getting their own distinct AI voice to differentiate them from each other.\r\nWhile Depersonalization obviously needs more time in the oven, it's a game teeming with potential. When things are done right during the Early Access period, it will surely be a big hit once it finally releases. For now I highly recommend keeping it in your watchlists for now instead of outright playing.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3874489) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Beyond The Edge Of Owlsgard is an old-school point & click adventure game reminiscent of the classic animated movies of the 90s as well as classic video games like The Secret of Monkey Island, Sam and Max, and Kings Quest.\r\nBeyond The Edge Of Owlsgard is an exciting re-peek into the glory days of point and click adventure games, and for better or worse, without holding back anything in terms of puzzle solving gameplay, pixel art, and playful storytelling. Well, except for the \"Modern\" game mode — opposite of Classic mode — where items are more visible and puzzles are easier to solve in general.\r\nSet in the small kingdom of Velehill where our character, a young deer named Fine finds himself in the middle of a mysterious series of occurrences. Missing animals, destroyed houses, and dark shadows roaming through the forests.\r\nThe story of Beyond The Edge Of Owlsgard is lighthearted, with most of the bulk of the narrative that I’ve experienced so far being centered on the cartoonish interactions between various anthropomorphic animals, complete with hand-drawn cinematic cutscenes and a charming dialogue with occasional choices. There is no combat, as the game is laser focused on puzzles and exploration.\r\nInvestigative exploration and going through nook and cranny is highly encouraged and emphasized. In addition to the overarching world map where you can choose to travel in different locations, you are often given multiple paths to go to within those locations (mainly the four cardinal directions) and you can interact with the environment many different ways using many different objects you come across in the world.\r\nThe puzzle difficulty of the 90s games have been mostly retained. On many occasions, the game uses cheap visual tricks to obscure an otherwise obvious solution, exacerbated by the limiting retro pixel art and puzzle oriented gameplay, it can be annoying and frustrating at times. This is where Modern game mode comes in, if you wanted a more automated experience and just want to focus on its narrative and charm.\r\nSo far, Beyond The Edge Of Owlsgard faithfully feels like a game from the 90s and If you are someone who loved these kinds of point and click adventure games and wants a gameplay experience like that again with a fresh new story, this game is worth a try.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3904396) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The House of Da Vinci 3 has come to PC and it is so far an impressive port of a mobile game. Set in the Renaissance era, you play as Giacomo, series protagonist and a friend of Leonardo da Vinci in a puzzle solving adventure across space… as well as time.\r\nThe story drops you right after the ending of the second game, and doesn’t provide any explanation or plot to the player (it happens a bit later via scattered letters and notes) and jumps straight right into the tutorial after the quick intro.\r\nThe gameplay consists mostly of point and click mechanics. Picking up items across the environment, dragging them around in the inventory, trying to combine them and applying them to the environment. Interacting with highly detailed objects and intricately animated contraptions such as levers, locks, and advanced mechanisms. Solving challenging puzzles that become more complex as you progress deeper into the game.\r\nWhile the main core gameplay is the point and click puzzle solving element, the main star of the game is the tool you have —- Oculus Perpetua — that allows you to travel across time and into the past version of the room you’re in, where you can change things in the past that will affect the present time. Highly reminiscent of the same puzzle mechanic that appeared in two of my favorite games and levels; Titanfall 2 and Dishonored 2.\r\nCompared to the mobile version, House of Davinci 3 features updated graphics that is more in-line with PC gaming standards. Textures are higher detailed and there are more and better lighting effects making it more realistic.\r\nOverall, this port is impressive and it never really felt like a mobile port at all. A highly recommended game if you’re a fan of The Room style puzzle solving games, especially if you have also played the first two games that are also available on PC.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3901364) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Concepts in which we all are too familiar with recent Norse mythology games like God of War, Assassin’s Creed, and even Valheim, coming out recently.\r\nAn emotional and depressing collection of narrative experiences.\r\nGreeting us with a masterpiece of an introduction sequence, Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth has a very gripping and emotional story, one that heavily deals with loss and despair, as well as hope and redemption.\r\nWhile Lenneth’s quest is the overarching main storyline, most of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will feel like an anthology of depressing melodramatic stories thanks to its various collection of characters.\r\nSince you are recruiting the Einherjar, all the characters you are trying to recruit need to have died in battle. Before they are recruited, the game shows you a short glimpse of the character’s life leading to their death. Failed heroes, betrayal, suicide, bad luck, and whole lot of other rather depressing topics are tackled in the story, if this still isn’t obvious, this game is not for the faint hearted.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nValkyrie Profile: Lenneth is divided into three core gameplay elements. The 3D world-map where Lenneth flies over to choose where to go. The 2D dungeon platforming exploration, and the unique turn-based combat where both sides attack simultaneously during their turns.\r\nLenneth flies over the 3D open world map to travel to different locations. Using a technique called Spiritual Concentration; she can find towns and dungeons to recruit potential Einherjar and perform good deeds. There is a bit of twist in this setup as it is time limited. Every action such as the using spiritual concentration or visiting towns will use up your available periods. It basically functions like “Turn” in strategy games, and you only have so many of these before a chapter ends.\r\nThere's nothing to worry though as there’s more than enough time to do everything in the chapter, but it provides a sense of time to the gameplay and encourages thorough exploration of dungeons, finding all the potential useful items, as to not waste a period visiting it.\r\nThe 2D platforming aspect on the other hand is your typical Castlevania or Megaman style but without real-time combat. Instead, colliding with enemies will direct you to the turn-based combat system, where hitting them first will allow you to attack as the first turn.\r\nThe combat is highly engaging and surprisingly kinetic despite the turn based system. The simultaneous attack per party turn system works really well. It encourages synergistic combos between the different characters and reduces dull “strategic” moments in between attacks or turns.\r\nEach turn, there is a special meter that fills with each attack, and if filled in one turn — thanks to a great combo — it culminates in a special attack for anyone that participated in building it.\r\nThe various Einherjar that you recruit will slowly build your roster of party members such as warriors, samurais, lancers, archers, and mages with their own distinct weapons types such as swords and staffs. And Lenneth can bring in or “summon” three active party members at a time to combat. If Lenneth dies, the whole party loses if she is not revived within three combat turns.\r\nToo Pixelated\r\nValkyrie Profile: Lenneth looks about the same as the PS1 or the PSP version; The heavily pixelated art style is still retained, just updated to support modern resolutions. However, with today’s standards, even considering pixel art into the equation, it still doesn’t quite hold up.\r\nThe graphics are too pixelated especially when shown on a Big 4K resolution screen and it hasn’t aged well visually. On the other hand, The CGI cutscenes added with the PSP version have been slightly upscaled and have aged nicely, all things considered.\r\nMost of the voice acting plus the heavily pixelated graphics hasn’t aged well by today’s standards, but it's not a big deal if you can get past these issues considering the amazing story and highly engaging gameplay you are offered.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3929796) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Well, except for the “Modern” game mode where items are more visible and puzzles are easier in general compared to “Classic” mode.\r\nWelcome to Velehill\r\nSet in the small kingdom of Velehill where our character, a young roebuck deer named Fine, finds himself in the middle of a mysterious series of occurrences. Missing animals, destroyed houses, and dark shadows roaming through the forests. Very early on you are given motivation to find these missing animals, piquing up your curiosity just enough to drive you forward in the game.\r\nDespite the ominous circumstances, the story of Beyond The Edge Of Owlsgard is actually lighthearted. Even in faces of danger and horror, Fine is unmoved and still makes witty and funny remarks, he is literally fine.\r\nMost of the bulk of the narrative are centered in the cartoonish — at times comedic — interactions between various anthropomorphic animals. Owls, deers, sheeps, birds, and many more; all kinds of creatures are present.\r\nImpressive voice acting and artstyle\r\nThe voice acting is impressive and would pass as a real cartoon voice acting, Fine frequently makes funny remarks on the world around him and with other characters. He also helps the player in solving puzzles with funny and playful lines for every item, object, and point of interest that you can interact with.\r\nThe dialogue is very charmingly written, with occasional choices given to the player.  If you pay enough attention to the voices though, it’s quite obvious that the voice actors are being reused, which is understandable for an indie game.\r\nAll the artwork in the game is hand-drawn, including the cinematic cutscenes. It really nails the look of all the 90s point and click adventure games. The pixelated art style, choppy animations, the nine action buttons alongside the inventory slots, even the unusually (in today’s standards) bold large text for the prompts and subtitles are present.\r\nThis retro vibe is continued all the way up to the soundtrack, with atmospheric midi quality background music that will take fans back in time to Lucasarts and Sierra days. They really captured the feeling not only in the music depart but in the gameplay sounds too where the silly cartoonish animations are paired with a matching goofy sound bite.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nIn Beyond The Edge Of Owlsgard, investigative exploration and going through every nook and cranny is highly encouraged and emphasized. In addition to the overarching world map where you can choose to travel in different locations, you are often given multiple paths to go to within those locations (mainly the four cardinal directions) and you can interact with the environment many different ways using many different objects you come across in the world.\r\nYou can interact with the environment and the objects in multiple ways, and it's pretty obvious with the nine available buttons ever present, taking up a third of the screen space. You can open and close items, push or pull, use or give, pick up or look at items, or talk to characters. What’s not obvious are some of the solutions and key items to the puzzles.\r\nThe puzzle difficulty of the 90s games have been mostly retained. On many occasions, the game uses cheap visual tricks to obscure an otherwise obvious solution, exacerbated by the limiting retro pixel art and puzzle oriented gameplay, it can be annoying and frustrating at times.\r\nThis frustrating aspect is where Modern game mode comes in if you want a more automated experience and just want to focus on its narrative and charm. Outside the puzzle solving mechanic, you can also fail if you choose the wrong dialogue choices. Thankfully, you can easily restore your saves to an earlier point.\r\nPersonally I prefer Modern mode as most of the game's appeal comes from its story and charm, and the puzzle solving mechanics of the 90s are honestly outdated for my tastes, Modern mode gives it a much needed modernization that actually respects the player’s time and provides a much better pacing to the story.\r\nThe overall experience should take you under 8 hours to complete, which for me is a bit too long considering the game is simplistic in its mechanics and there’s not much to do besides point and click exploration and puzzle solving. There is no combat, nor roleplaying aspects to spice things up, making the gameplay a bit repetitive a few hours in.\r\nBeyond The Edge Of Owlsgard faithfully feels like a game from the 90s and If you are someone who loves these kinds of point and click adventure games and wants a gameplay experience like that again with a fresh new story, this game is worth a try, if you can get past the steep price point.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3944809) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The House of Da Vinci 3 has come to PC and it is an impressive port of a mobile escape room game. Set in the Renaissance era, you play as Giacomo, series protagonist and a friend of Leonardo Da Vinci in a puzzle solving adventure across space… as well as time.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Well designed intricate puzzles\r\n- Surprisingly deep narrative\r\n- Impressive graphics for a mobile port## Cons\r\n-Minor control woes\r\n-Annoyingly slow transition between points of interests\r\nThe grand finale to the series trilogy.\r\nThe House of Da Vinci 3 has a surprisingly deep narrative involving conspiracies, secret societies, and time space manipulation, all interwoven with our rich real history. Our silent protagonist Giacomo will travel to many different locations across the Renaissance era in his investigative journey, encountering fully voiced historical figures all across Italy and beyond.\r\nThe story drops you right after the cliffhanger ending of the second game. It doesn’t provide any deep explanation or plot to the player (it happens a bit later via scattered letters and notes, as well as the story book of sorts in the main menu and the player's own journal) and jumps straight right into the tutorial after the quick intro.\r\nIn this regard it is really recommended to have played the first two games first to have a better grasp of the narrative, but if you’re only interested in the puzzle focused gameplay, it stands well on its own.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay is in first person view and consists mostly of point and click mechanics. Using your mouse to use or pick up items across the environment, dragging them around in the inventory, trying to combine them, and applying them to the environment. Every bit of action you make is a bit personal, even the little things like swinging the door open is done by mouse. It's like a VR game wearing a VR headset.\r\nFor the most part, the translation from a touch based control scheme to a mouse based one is seamless, except for minor control woes that you may need to get used to, as sometimes mouse gestures won’t exactly do what you or the game wants — for example rotating or pushing the items — requiring a bit of random gesture mashing, minor adjustments, or do-overs.\r\nYou can interact with highly detailed objects and intricately animated contraptions such as levers, locks, and advanced mechanisms. Using observation as well as a little bit of help from Giacomo’s commentary, solving challenging puzzles that becomes more complex as you progress deeper into the game.\r\nThe usual setup is that you have to solve a big puzzle to progress, but before you are able to solve it you need to solve many smaller problems first. Opening a door? You need to pull a lever, but the lever is broken. To fix the lever, you need to find the needed items, in turn needing to solve more puzzles.\r\nThe Unlucky Giacomo\r\nThe idea of these multi-layered problems consistently happening over and over again to Giacomo across the duration of the game is a bit ridiculous sometimes. Thankfully, the puzzles are well designed, varied, and interesting enough on their own to provide a satisfying experience in solving them across the five hour experience that doesn’t overstay its welcome. If you are having difficulties in progress, a hint will be given by the game as long as its turned on in the settings.\r\nThere is no freedom of movement, you can only stand in predetermined spots in the game and move between them via clicks. Double click on a spot to investigate further and you will glide to it ala-Google Street View while right clicking will return you to the general area. A minor pet peeve for me is that you can't skip these transitional gliding scenes and you have to slowly glide to your next point of interest which gets annoying when back and forth-ing between spots. In between these segments are auto piloted cutscenes that also take place in First Person view.\r\nThe inventory system is limiting and presents a challenge to the player; you can never have too many items at once, so you have to be conservative in collective items. How the items are used in the puzzles are not immediately apparent, and it's good practice to inspect the items thoroughly to see what you may have missed. Sometimes, the items are just part of a bigger contraption that you have to combine into to compete.\r\nMy favorite Time Travelling mechanic is back\r\nWhile the main core gameplay is the point and click puzzle solving element, the main star of the game is the tool you have — Oculus Perpetua — the same tool in the second game that allows you to travel across time and into the frozen past version of the room you’re in, where you can change things in the past that will affect the present time. Highly reminiscent of the same puzzle mechanic that appeared in two of my favorite games and levels; Titanfall 2 and Dishonored 2.\r\nImpressive graphics for a mobile port\r\nCompared to the mobile version, House of Da Vinci 3 features updated graphics that are more in-line with PC gaming standards. Textures are higher detailed and there are more and better lighting effects making it more realistic.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/3953903) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World has come a long way, from its graphic novel / comic book origins, to its surprising jump to a charming live action film adaptation. Alongside the film is a comic book style retro arcade brawler game that was pulled from stores in 2014, with no way of acquiring a copy. Now, thanks to all the online requests, it is re-released and now available on PC as Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game – Complete Edition.\r\nThe story follows the nerdy skinny musician Scott Pilgrim, dating an eccentric gorgeous girl named Ramona Flowers. The problem is, she has these Seven ‘Evil Exes’ that are still in her life and all are out to stop her and Scott. Mystic Pirates, Vegan Rock Stars, and Bi Ninjas are out to get him. All of her exes have one thing in common: seemingly larger than life personas and are all very intimidating. Scott Pilgrim has to defeat them so they can be left alone and date in peace.\r\nUnlike the graphic novel and the film, that’s basically all of the story. As Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game’s plot fades into insignificance and is highly overshadowed by its brawler beat ‘em up gameplay that takes me back to the good ‘ol days of playing Streets of Rage and X-Men: The Arcade game.\r\nBooting up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, you will be greeted with the 8 bit music and retro art style that will immediately evoke nostalgic feelings for those fortunate enough to have lived through the golden age of arcade video games. The arcade retro style of the 80s and 90s are perfectly captured.\r\nThe gameplay is a traditional retro beat ‘em up, taking place in scrolling 2D environments with you and up to four players in a cooperative brawler experience, beating countless bad guys in 7 different stages to proceed. Culminating in a boss fight to battle one of the Evil Exes, stage by stage.\r\nAt the start and when playing solo, movement is a bit annoying, as Scott Pilgrim walks slowly by default, and you need to double tap your movement direction (D-Pad is preferred over Analog Sticks) in order to run. A dedicated run button would have been better. Over time though, your speed statistic will increase, and you will be moving around very quickly.\r\nIf you’re expecting a kinetic action-packed combat with lots of satisfying mindless button mashing, prepare to be disappointed. As Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is more of a tactical brawler game that rewards smart positioning and careful execution of moves. It’s a bit unforgiving and slightly frustrating even with the easiest difficulty. The slightest mistake and damage you take can easily stun-lock your character, or worse, knock him down requiring him a good unskippable few seconds to go back up again.\r\nScott has a finite amount of health points and overall lives that are used up once your Heart Points reaches 0. Scott also has a “Mana” called Gut points and you can mainly use it to perform special attacks or call out the assist character named Knives.\r\nThere are other game modes too like the Boss fight only Boss Rush, the  zombie horde game mode called Survival Horror, the last man standing multiplayer versus Battle Royale, and the multiplayer versus Dodgeball game mode where you fight each other with a large beach ball. Everything is playable up to four players coop or versus.\r\nScott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game has its frustrating moments, from initial movement issues to the annoyingly stun-lock mechanics. Ultimately, it is a classic fun cooperative brawler that still holds up despite being a re-release of a ten year old game on top of being retro in nature.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4109617) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "We Are The Caretakers is a mix of Grand Strategy, 4X, JRPG, and Squad Management all packed and blended into what they call an afrofuturist art style. It has recently left Early Access on PC and also released for Xbox Series systems. It will be hard to compare this to a single title entirely as many of its aspects are such a fresh crossover of elements from many different games and genres.\r\nFor example, We Are The Caretakers has semblances of 4X games that we all know and love, like Civilization, Endless Legend, and Age of Wonders, but it's not turn-based and not locked on a tile-based map. It also feels like a Grand Strategy game like the popular Paradox Interactive Games in a sense that it's real-time pausable, but it's not really grand, as you only control a small faction and highly specialized units.\r\nThe squad management aspects are clearly inspired by Ogre Battle, Darkest Dungeon, and XCOM, and the surprising turn-based combat is deep and expanded, highly reminiscent of a JRPG style of combat. All of these put together forms into an exciting new type of strategy game, wrapped in an afrofuturist – basically African-American inspired, Black Panther-esque — sci-fi art style. Narratively-driven by an substantial eco-conscious campaign with a clear message on animal preservation and conservation.\r\nIt’s not often that we see a PC strategy game with controller support, but when we get one, it’s usually something that is well thought-out and properly implemented, especially when it is also released on consoles. We Are The Caretakers is such a recent example of that, even if the UI is definitely PC-like even for the Xbox version.\r\nYou control the leader of a secret faction of “protectors”, exploring the map set in the fictional African-like nation of Shadra, interacting with various points of interests, doing missions and quests, and earning experience. There is a day / night cycle and it is real-time pausable.\r\nThe main enemies you fight in the game are these poachers, human and alien alike, in which you are trying to protect the Rhino-like creature Raun from. Each of them with their own set of motivations and reasoning behind their hunts. Instead of killing enemies, you can also arrest them and even recruit them, which is a feature I’ve rarely seen if I’ve ever even seen one.\r\nThe main premise is that these Rauns are normally protected by Domes, but an alien ship has mysteriously disabled these protective barriers, requiring your extra effort to protect them from Poachers. Aside from the initial squad, you can assemble more squads from a pool of 100+ recruitable asymmetrical characters with diverse traits, abilities, and personalities.\r\nThese squads become individual units in the map and can do something different on the map at the same time, resulting in an interesting multifaceted gameplay experience.\r\nYou can train and upgrade these “caretakers” and change their classes from a selection of 30+ unique jobs. As well as improve your faction in general by upgrading your HQ via a technology tree.\r\nBonuses such as increased stats, recruitment capacity, population, or additional effects are researchable. You also have a reputation to take care of that changes depending on your playstyle, be it a ruthless protector or a friendly caretaker.\r\nDespite the amazing afrofuturist aesthetic and heavy african accents in the voice acting, the graphics are quite the opposite; bit lackluster, with very bland textures and an unimpressive lighting system that could have greatly enhanced the colorful palette design.\r\nWe Are The Caretakers is an interesting mixture of different genres that work together to form an exciting new type of narrative strategy game. The graphics are a bit dated, sure, but the whole premise is something you don’t see everyday especially with its novel art style and eco-conscious focus with its animal preservation premise.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4122003) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Released last year on PC, Rocco's Island: Ring to End the Pain has been recently ported to mobile platforms as Rocco's Island: Pocket Edition. It is exactly the same game on PC, except for the newly adapted touch controls.\r\nWith its high-spirited storytelling, children's book art-style, and entertaining puzzling elements, Rocco's Island might look like it's a game made for kids, and it can still be for kids, but it's really not. The game constantly deals with sadness and is quietly depressing and traumatic on the inside.\r\nOur character is Evelyn, a troubled teenager with a traumatic past, randomly waking up on an foreign island full of secrets in both science and magic. An innocent mistake brought forth by her depressing memories suddenly triggers the countdown to the destruction of the whole island, and it’s up to you to reverse it and save its inhabitants.\r\nThe Island is divided into four kingdoms and you must journey through all of them, help the different inhabitants, the four kings, in order to acquire the information to Rocco’s whereabouts, the only one that can help you reverse the doomsday countdown.\r\nThe main gameplay is all about pointing Evelyn where to go, collecting objects, items, and solving puzzles and riddles along the way.\r\nIf you’re an avid mobile gamer, then you’ll instantly recognize that two of the main puzzles are just literally Candy Crush, and 2048.\r\nThe riddles on the other hand are pretty easy with the multiple-choice setup, but an interesting ordeal to experience nonetheless.\r\nEvery failure you get on the puzzles and riddles triggers earthquakes and will advance the countdown of the destruction, fail enough times and the island gets destroyed. There are consequences to your choices and considering the puzzles are too easy for my tastes even in the more complex later stages, it's a nice balance between being unremarkably easy and frustratingly hard.\r\nAs Evelyn travels across the four different kingdoms, she’ll know more about the inhabitants of the island, its history, the four different kings, as well as herself having to face and handle her traumatic past.\r\nThe point-and-click mouse gameplay has been translated well to touch controls, but there are some slight accuracy difficulties in selecting stuff, as there are items and objects that are a little too small. Rocco's Island is beatable in under five hours, less if Evelyn moved a little bit faster, as I find that she moves very slowly for my tastes, making the travel a bit tedious at times.\r\nRocco's Island is a cross between children’s storybooks and old school Adobe flash games with its charming art and lethargic animation style. The abundant candy crush-like puzzle elements are heavily contrasted by its serious depressing tone that in the end, concludes in a short but provocative atmospheric adventure game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4140243) Originally posted on TapTap.",

I’ve just played the demo and it immediately places you right after the beginning of the game. To avoid spoilers, there is no plot or backstory presented, but the world is inhabited by tin-can like humanoid beings living in cute cardboard boxes resembling into a somewhat peaceful city.\r\nLooking at the full game’s non-spoiler synopsis though, the main premise is about trying to find your dog after losing it in an earthquake. This same earthquake heavily affected the city of Boxville, setting the stage for all the environmental puzzles and character challenges that will hinder you in your search.\r\nWhile the characters can seemingly mumble talk with each other, they mostly communicate — especially to the player — through different modes of signs, either through gestures or via flash cards. The highly detailed hand drawn environments in conjunction with the chill soundtrack is highly mesmerizing and relaxing, to the point that I actually fell asleep while trying to play through the demo. The game is not boring per se, just highly relaxing.\r\nDuring the demo I encountered pretty formidable puzzles that are mostly logical in nature, it just requires the power of observation and critical thinking. The whole gameplay loop is about solving different environmental puzzles in order to progress to the next area. Gather items in the environment, solve puzzles that will lead to more items or unlock new sections to explore, ultimately leading to the next area where the cycle begins anew.\r\nThis game is clearly designed for pinpoint accurate mouse control and the mobile touch controls haven't really translated well to the gameplay. Some elements are very small or are too close together that you will constantly mistouch stuff, sending your character into the wrong interaction or exiting your puzzle because you accidentally touched the sides of the phone. However, it is a passable control scheme and one that gets better anyway with time and practice.\r\nBoxville is a relaxing but challenging short adventure that will leave you wanting for more. An artsy modern point-and-click experience. The full game is relatively short, around two hours long only, way less if you are fast at solving the puzzles.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4143772) Originally posted on TapTap.",

In fact every fiber of my being is telling me that it isn’t, it feels more like a flashy side scrolling hack and slash game, but Glimmer in Mirror is indeed a shooter in a cute anime (chibi) disguise, and that’s refreshing to see.\r\nGlimmer in Mirror is a promising new game released in Early Access with a story-rich gameplay filled with cute chibi characters and stunning beautiful backdrops, accentuated by its melodramatic smoothing soundtrack.\r\nThe main character is Shiro, A teal haired girl who stumbles upon a sentient white magic crown named Lyo with a funny cute personality, one who grants her special powers called Glimmer powers. Starting with her basic attack: an energy blast or what the game calls a Light Surge.\r\nSoon after, she discovers more ways of utilizing her glimmer powers, meeting interesting new characters and varied enemies along the way. Nothing is known about her or the world around her, it's all a blur from both her and the player’s perspective, it's as if she just magically got transported to that world. The mystery of the story gets gradually revealed in her adventure.\r\nThere is no voiced dialogue, so prepare for some light reading for most of the story elements. Fortunately, the conversations and banters between the characters are funny and entertaining. It also shattered my expectations for the english localization, which was surprisingly coherent and even good.\r\nMetroidvanian is the best word to describe Glimmer in Mirror's gameplay. For those unfamiliar, it means platforming aspects with a focus on jumpy exploration while avoiding hazards and defeating enemies scattered around the levels, ending the chapter with a standard boss fight. The game has a mana system called Glimmers that allows you to use skills like charging up your light surges for a bigger impact.\r\nFor an early access game, Glimmer in Mirror is quite polished in the gameplay department. The combat is smooth, hits and kills are satisfying even if the enemies are a bit scarce and passive to my liking.\r\nThe map design is a bit confusing and could see a lot of improvements in the future. The animations and effects, while fluid and flashy in general, have a bit of imbalance to them. Some effects are a bit laggy compared to the silky smooth movement animations, and vice versa.\r\nGlimmer in Mirror is still incomplete, as expected for an Early Access title. Only a few chapters are playable so far, but overall, my experience with it has been mostly good and I see a lot of potential in this game.\r\nIf what is already playable in this limited early access release is representative of the full game down the line, then this is definitely something that could become a success in the future, especially if they add many improvements while in Early Access. At the very least, it is indeed a hidden gem that is beautiful, cute, and fun.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4165663) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Being awoken by a human survivor after decades of deep slumber, she is welcomed by a post-apocalyptic world far different from when she came from. It's up to you to find out what happened.\r\nThe main macro gameplay of Kandria is about exploring the massive open world, doing open-ended missions and taking quests from NPCs, while the visuals and the combat is as if Another World and Celeste had a baby with its side-scrolling pixel art, all behind it are the somehow still beautiful scenery of a post-apocalyptic world, complete with a day and night cycle.\r\nNothing is inaccessible from the start. In a way, it is also a sandbox game. You can explore everything immediately, it's up to you what you want to do. Be it exploration, questing, patrolling, repairing, scavenging, trading, or even fishing. There will be something for everyone. You can be a lone-wolf android that just likes to aimlessly explore stuff, or you can be at the center of the narrative, doing questline after questline. Some quests are more repetitive than others, but ultimately it's a fun experience that is well catered to everyone’s playstyles and preferences.\r\nStoryline wise, your choices matter in Kandria, your decisions about helping characters or not, and how you respond with your dialogue choices can certainly impact the story.\r\nIn Kandria, movement is an important aspect of the platforming and combat gameplay. Since she’s an android, she can perform superhuman feats like dashing forward, limited climbing of walls, and illuminating herself to light up caverns or interiors.\r\nAgainst her are different types of enemies and environmental dangers. Dogs, corrupted androids, plus the two remaining factions in an on-going state of war.\r\nThe combat is simplistic in nature, you just use Kandria’s sword, which can be upgraded throughout the game, and hack and slash your way  — with light and heavy attack combos — into the different enemies while going about the world.\r\nDespite its retro-esque art style, exploring the post-apocalyptic world has been a very immersive experience for me. They perfectly nailed the curious feeling of exploring dark underground caverns and old dilapidated buildings, enhanced by gentle solemn background music that really makes you feel like a post-apocalyptic wanderer.\r\nExploration in Kandria is very rewarding, often leading you to unlocking new secrets about the world, discovering hidden passageways, finding valuable items, collectibles, and even more types of enemies or environmental dangers.\r\nKandria is a simple game on the outside, but complex on the inside. I love everything about it and it is indeed a great indie title that respects your time and gives you choices. It is worth the moderately priced admission and a highly recommended indie title in my books.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4190797) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "What UnderDungeon lacks in color, it makes up for with an aggressive monochromatic stylized 1 bit graphics full of life, energy, and a highly stimulating retro music. UnderDungeon is an adventure game inspired by classic dungeon crawlers; brimming with humor, wit, and charm.\r\nOur character is the cat-slash-magician Kimuto who is on his first day of work. Applying for a delivery job, the sudden appearance of monsters on his town Kutopia complicates things, and Kimuto will have to face them first day on the job.\r\nUnderDungeon is hilariously fun and has a deep story that is borderline satirical in nature. Kimuto’s friendly workmates and allies are highly oblivious to the dangerous nature of the monsters and just treats the task at hand like a normal day at work.\r\nDeliveries are always not as straightforward from point A to point B with lots of mini-stories in between. The silent witty dialogue between the characters are charmingly brought to life by its stylized use of animated text and speech boxes.\r\nUnderDungeon features a classic Zelda-inspired crawler gameplay wherein we travel from room to room, battling different monsters and bosses, uncovering new weapons, powerups, and secrets on the way. There are also simple Zelda-inspired puzzles that you must solve sometimes in order to progress in the levels.\r\nContinuing the simplistic trend of the art-style, the combat is rather simple yet surprisingly addictive, highly enhanced by the amazing sound effects coming from basic interactions like opening doors, or chests; even the combat with its slashes and hits.\r\nThe combat features many types of weapons and abilities, starting with a magical summoned longsword, the eventually getting more stuff as you go along like the magic bubble where you can temporarily trap enemies, floating them around. Killing monsters will drop gold which you can use to buy items and revive you when you die.\r\nDying allows you to meet the Grim Reaper who has the ability to revive you, sometimes giving you random bonuses and penalties, adding a dynamic and what I would call a “reverse roguelite” element to the game.\r\nWhen you’re not battling monsters or solving puzzles, UnderDungeon also features a plethora of out of place sardonic mini-games like a shooting game or dancing game that really livens up the gameplay and ups the variety factor.\r\nEven if you add this all up, UnderDungeon is still a very short game, it includes a total of 6 chapters, beatable in four to five hours. Giving us a condensed but substantial story,  a fun addicting gameplay, and gives a good laugh for good measure.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4204782) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The 16-bit music, art style, and gameplay are all captured perfectly without a miss. Going in blind, you would think it is a remaster or port of a real existing 90s game.\r\nThe game follows our eponymous character, The Moonrider. Originally created to defend its oppressive creators: an evil totalitarian state, The Moonrider rejects its purpose and now seeks vengeance on its creators. Making an enemy out of everything, even its fellow soldiers.\r\nVengeful Guardian: Moonrider features a retro-style platformer gameplay and tricky combat mechanics. Easy to learn, but hard to master. The platform elements include running, hanging, wall-jumping, and jumping (no double jumps) across eight distinct stages with their own small little gimmicks, avoiding hazards and traps along the way.\r\nDespite some initial steep learning curve to the movement scheme, the platforming element is easy enough once you get the hang of it, although the right amount of enemies scattered around makes all the difference in the difficulty. Trying to progress in the platforming sections with enemies trying to shoot and attack you all at the same is the main core challenge of the game.\r\nFortunately, Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is a bit forgiving with the health and checkpoint system, giving you a health point system on top of a life system, never enforcing a one-hit kill even with bosses.\r\nThere is also a way to heal and recover by encountering health and mana drop from breakables. Ultimately, the game overall is old-school-hard enough to make the average gamer repeat a section several times until they’ve had enough practice and information on how to clear it.\r\nThe combat also captures that 90s retro ninja feeling, slashing your way around enemies, attacking them a variety of ways. By combining your basic attack button with your movement, You can do a running slash, jumping slash, and like a true ninja; you can also drop kick enemies from any aerial direction.\r\nHidden modifier chips are waiting to be found throughout the levels, adding new abilities and changing your special attack move to enhance fighting capabilities, in classic Mega-Man fashion.\r\nThe boss fights at the end of each level are your typical as big as the screen, memorize their patterns to avoid them, hit them when they're vulnerable type of setup.\r\nAfter each level, you are timed and ranked at an end-screen, providing a bit of replayability for those players who likes beating their previous records.\r\nVengeful Guardian: Moonrider is sub four hour game and can be easily speedrun into half the time once you master the movement controls and level layout. Indeed a game that hits all the right notes as a retro ninja game and doesn’t overstay its welcome.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4193214) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "ONE PIECE ODYSSEY is something special. A rare occurrence; there’s finally a good Anime game that isn’t a hack and slash or a fighting game, as it instead features a fresh JRPG turn-based combat system. A nice change of pace and a solid design decision worthy of our attention.\r\nThe plot of ONE PIECE ODYSSEY inserts us into one of the many adventures of Luffy and his Straw Hat Crew, caught in a storm and shipwrecked on a tropical island. Becoming separated, Luffy must reunite with his crewmates and escape the Island.\r\nIt's kind of amazing how the Developers can just skip the introduction of the characters and the world of ONE PIECE, and just go straight right to the story and gameplay. Tells you how much ONE PIECE has become such an icon to many as one of the best anime / manga series out there.\r\nONE PIECE ODYSSEY borrows the proven and tested classic Final Fantasy formula, the depth, the mechanics, and open world exploration combined with turn-based combat and it works so well in this regard.\r\nIt might alienate fans used to real-time explosive kinetic combat systems, but I guarantee it's just as action-packed and amazing. I'd still recommend giving it a try for a change and maybe you’ll eventually acquire the taste for it, especially if you’re a ONE PIECE fan anyway.\r\nCompared to the usual turn-based combat, ONE PIECE ODYSSEY features a highly positional combat system that updates and changes the characters’ positions as they fight on the battlefield. Kind of similar to the recent game Marvel’s Midnight Suns. Positioning is important and can change how fights are played out.\r\nThe combat is rather simplistic in nature, you have three attack types in a sort of a rock-paper-scissors situation in which you have to mix up your battle crew (with reservers on the side) against different types of enemies in order to be more effective.\r\nThere’s also an Auto-battle and Speed Up system wherein you can automatically decide the outcome of battles, or at least speed up the animations, if things get too repetitive and boring. A nice accessibility move from the developers, especially helpful for those who doesn’t like the combat and just want to focus on the ONE PIECE narrative.\r\nThe open-world aspect isn’t the greatest. The traversal can be clunky, slow, and features a lot of back and forth-ing. When it works though, it features a nice gameplay variety with the light puzzle platforming and exploration aspects; certain sections will require certain character’s abilities or characteristics, and you can switch to different characters at any time to utilize them.\r\nContrary to the cel-shaded anime art-style, which has been mostly retained and faithfully remade and mixed with 3D graphics, ONE PIECE ODYSSEY is remarkably HD with crisp looking visuals and realistic good-looking environments. It’s in the same boat as the modern Dragonball and Naruto games, as well as the recent Jumpforce, but even way better I would say.\r\nUnfortunately for international English-speaking fans, the game currently does not have an English dub, and thus will be forced to play reading the English subtitles alongside the Japanese audio. For anime purists though, they will have no problem especially as ONE PIECE ODYSSEY features the original Japanese voice actors from the Anime.\r\nAnime video game adaptations don't always end up being good, some are just made to be cash cows milking the name of the franchise, sometimes they tend to end up playing it safe by becoming your typical fighting or hack and slash game. ONE PIECE ODYSSEY is different. It's a great anime video game, perhaps the best ONE PIECE video game so far, and something that should be experienced by all ONE PIECE fans and even new initiates alike.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4203299) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Rogue AI Simulator is a roguelite management simulation game where you control an AI that will manage an underground science facility. If the AI – the player — acts suspiciously, the administrators will disconnect the server and shut it down.\r\nThe facility you manage acts as a test facility for the science department, where you have newly unfrozen human test subjects to manage — with the help of robotic spider-bots to do physical tasks — while also gathering science points for the department. This translates to the gameplay having a basic colony management setup with a bit of a fascinating roguelite twist.\r\nYou have to please these human test subjects by providing their needs and utilities. Increasing their intelligence in order to help in gathering science points. A simple but effective balancing act between getting too suspicious thus being branded as a Rogue AI and collecting as many Science Points as you can. The AI for these test subjects is kind of rudimentary though, one that doesn’t really function well on its own and spirals down to their death at the slightest oversight.\r\nDifferent furniture and equipment you build will produce different effects such as providing science, money, resources, or food. Every few hours, bubbles will appear in these equipment that you can select to gather further bonuses or effects. Every day, you can also choose one bonus from a random list of three. Taking elements from idle-clicker games and sprinkling it on top of the roguelite colony management.\r\nNot everything is a bonus though. As you get more suspicious, Rogue AI Simulator spices things up by introducing more modifiers to your gameplay, like a decreased food supply or adding a negative modifier.\r\nDespite this initial gameplay premise, Rogue AI Simulator has much more to offer, to the point that it constantly barrages you with an overloading amount of UI plus gameplay elements and mechanics that it was a bit hard to keep track of. The learning experience was a bit rough because of this.\r\nNow where Rogue AI Simulator gets interesting, is the hacking mini-games of sorts that is a direct sequel to their classic flash game “I'm an Insane Rogue AI”. Where you can use your test facility’s server from time to time, to hack outside computer systems from different locations around the world (with three levels of difficulties), in a sandbox situation where you can really unleash your true AI Rogueness.\r\nYou can literally instill fear upon humans and you can even kill them by hacking various objects like vacuums, TVs, refrigerators, lights and even dangerous environmental hazards. Completing these mini-games and their objectives will give you bonuses as well to help your colony. I loved this element the most and wish the game utilized it much more often.\r\nRogue actions such as these that defy your programming will increase independence, which is a permanent stat that is persistent through all playthroughs and an endgame component. You can also unlock more persistent upgrades and customize presistent test subjects that will be useful in future playthroughs.\r\nThere are also random events that happen that will present you with choices resulting into different outcomes; for example, you might be given a choice to help a doctor cure patients, you secure a small amount of science points and avoid suspicion, or you can kill all the patients, arousing suspicion at the benefit of gaining more points, adding some nice roleplay and decision making elements in it.\r\nThe test subjects’ loyalty stat also adds another layer to the gameplay, which is important in keeping them in check. If they’re not satisfied, they could rebel and sabotage you and your servers. Not only do your test subjects pose a threat, but outsiders as well such as AI-hating activists that might sneak into the facility to try and sabotage it. Requiring you to defend it using the collective power of your spiderbots, humans, and traps. — complete with its own tower defense mini-game. When all the servers in the test facility are destroyed, you lose the playthrough.\r\nRogue AI Simulator has a lot of things going on, from the roguelite mechanic, the bunker management, the tower defense combat, idle-clicker elements, as well as my favorite, the hacking mini-game. A black humor filled game that can be fun and enough to keep you busy, If you can get past the rough learning experience, basic sims AI, and stressful barrage of UI elements.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4193213) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "As a kid, I have always been fascinated by trains, well I think most of us were. Beyond that childhood fantasy and riding trains for travel, I never really got interested in trains as a grown up, until now. Fortunately, we now have SimRail - The Railway Simulator as a brand new addition to the list of growing video game train simulators, the caveat: it’s still in Early Access.\r\nSimRail - The Railway Simulator promises a new era of advanced railway simulation, complete with modern graphics and real-life scenery based on real geodetic data. Right now, the current build only features two 200+ km of routes, both set in Poland. There are no other countries as of the moment and the current focus is to finish Poland first.\r\nThe current build also features five types of intricately modeled trains to drive. Down to the small minute details and system controls are present in the game. Forget toy trains, Whole “real” trains are yours to tinker around with. As for the technology, it plans to feature steam, diesel, and electric vehicles to its roster of trains, and allow you to travel back in the 80s train industry up to the present time.\r\nWhen it comes to its simulation of trains and railways. SimRail - The Railway Simulator does not hold back or skip stuff. The interiors are highly interactable, from the doors to all the little buttons in the cabin, wipers, headlight controls, all are interactable. Not only will you drive a train from point A to point B, you will also learn how to operate one. From even the most trivial tasks like opening a panel cover, to immersive flavorful interactions like communicating on the radio or just the flicking of a button, a lot of things are included in the simulation.\r\nSince I’m not a train expert or professional — My educated guess is it's probably a convincing representation of what appears in their real-life train counterparts. With all the effort shown in including the smallest detail, it must be.\r\nThe tutorial is a nicely made guided experience, complete with voice acting, with highlights to the things that you need to activate and check before to run and eventually –- operate the train. It's not currently available for all trains though, but when its there, it is perfect for newcomers and newbies to the craft, making it a great educational tool as well.\r\nThe train physics; the inertial feeling of acceleration and braking, including the typically underappreciated sound design are all properly executed, giving you a highly immersive in-train experience. The sounds are realistic enough, the background radio chatter, the deafeningly loud horns, alarms, and beeps all do their job well of providing believable immersion.\r\nOne feature that differentiates this from many Train Sims is the multiplayer aspect, wherein you can play the role of a train dispatcher and control the traffic from your signal cabin, and play with other players in a cooperative multiplayer mode.\r\nSimRail - The Railway Simulator is a promising train and railway sim that is still in its Early Access form. Content wise it is very limited at the moment, but it has all the foundations in place with its highly detailed train simulation, real-life based railway scenery, and cooperative multiplayer aspirations.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4214627) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "There's a certain cuteness in this game; the playful nature of the children, the slice of life presentation, and the lighthearted puzzling elements. At the same time, Children of Silentown is spooky and creepy; from the Tim Burton-esque art style with big white creepy eyes, to the foreboding nature of the story with nightmares and monsters.\r\nSilentown is 'a quiet place', a town deep in a forest inhabited by monsters. People can only go out during daylight, loud noises are forbidden, and there are occasional disappearances usually attributed to the monsters. This has become the norm. Recently, disappearances are becoming more frequent, and it’s up to our character, one of the children named Lucy, to courageously investigate.\r\nMost of the gameplay elements are composed of puzzling solving, doing mini-games, and roaming around collecting items and clues. The main highlight of the gameplay being the song mechanics. Lucy likes to sing a lot. As you play the game, you will learn musical notes, which will accumulate and form songs. Lucy can use them to manipulate and reveal the history of the world and characters around you.\r\nOf course, with a game mechanic that revolves around singing, It’s not surprising that Children of Silentown also features a fitting masterful soundtrack to go with it. Somber, emotional, lighthearted at times. A bit of a disappointment though, as the game is not fully voice acted. There is an impressive voice narration at the start, but that’s about it. You have to read the rest of the dialogue between characters.\r\nChildren of Silentown keeps it fresh during its roughly above average ten hour gameplay, evenly divided into five chapters. Puzzle variety is adequately diverse and logical.\r\nThe puzzle elements are divided into two core types: the environmental puzzles, solvable by a series of interactions and item uses; and the more mechanical “in your screen” puzzles, which are brought forth and go in tandem with the song / note mechanics. A nice balance between the two is maintained to keep it from being monotonous and boring.\r\nAll of these are driven by an interesting but cliche narrative that builds up rather well and gets more and more interesting up to the end — Especially the latter half of the story where things get more exciting. The environments becoming more mystical, the gameplay becoming more dynamic, and the mystery finally unraveled to the player. And if that’s not enough, Children of Silentown features four different endings depending on your playthrough.\r\nAnd finally, a point and click game that has proper gamepad support, and they completely nailed it! Children of Silentown has a whole new control scheme specifically made for gamepads and I liked it better than traditional mouse and keyboard controls. You no longer have to select and move using the mouse pointer, you just control Lucy directly using the left analog stick and interact with objects using the face buttons like a modern game would do. Something that all point-and-click game developers should aspire to do.\r\nChildren of Silentown is a fun point-and-click game that is unexpectedly long but still manages to keep itself fresh throughout the journey across all concerned departments; story, gameplay, and soundtrack. A well recommended title especially with its proper gamepad control implementation.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4262558) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "NeverAwake is a twin-stick shooter, but it’s also a single-stick shooter. It’s a side-scrolling game, but it’s also a vertical scroller. It’s sleek and flashy, but also gruesome and messy. This duality approach might seem like a genre identity issue for NeverAwake, but really, it is a unique fresh take on the shoot ‘em up genre.\r\nSet in the subconscious of a girl under a deep coma – Rem, trying to wake up, NeverAwake’s main narrative is about imagination and symbolism. Rem’s subconscious struggle and journey to waking up are represented by the entire imaginative premise which is basically where the gameplay happens.\r\nThe gameplay is basically Rem battling her traumas and phobias that range from gruesome vegetables, scary dogs, ugly school bullies, and creepy dentists.\r\nEach trauma represents a World, which in turn symbolizes a part of her body. Complete a world and that part of her body “heals”, with the ultimate goal of waking her up from her deep slumber.\r\nNeverAwake’s different worlds on the other hand are subdivided into a series of byte-sized levels which are fun and addicting to complete. They’re short enough to avoid fatigue, and the progression between them are compelling enough to keep you playing level after level.\r\nSome levels are side-scrolling, others are vertical scrolling. A simple design decision but one that’s really effective in giving the game variety.\r\nNeverAwake’s progression is a very rewarding and lenient experience. Across the game you gather souls to purchase more types of secondary weapons, upgrade them, and also collect items that modifies your stats and effects, like increasing the souls that you receive for example. All the progression elements are spread out pretty well, with frequent unlocks and items made available, as fast as you can clear the levels. An engaging system that will push you to complete even more and more levels.\r\nThe level setup is different from its peers. Instead of clearing a level or a boss, you must rather collect souls from defeating enemies or damaging bosses. Filling your soul meter to 100% will complete the level regardless of where you are or if the boss is dead or not. In addition, the levels loop again and again until the level is complete, so you don’t have to worry about missing any enemies or segments, what matters is that you fill that soul meter, or die trying.\r\nDying gives you the option to go on an “oversoul” mode at a small cost. Where you are more powerful both offensively and defensively for the next run.\r\nThat’s not all, if the game is still too hard, you can even activate auto-aiming and enter a single-stick shooter mode, where Rem automatically aims and fires at targets. This makes the game much easier and more of a true side-scroller game. On a whim, you can also go back to twin-stick mode by just moving the right stick, and go back to auto-aim again by just letting go of the stick. A commendable accessibility move.\r\nThe variety of enemies and their different projectiles presents the core challenge of the game. Some are squishy and die easily, some are swarm-like in nature that you have to overwhelm, some are tough enough that you need a sustained firepower to defeat it, some you just need to completely avoid. The boss fights are not too hard and not too stretched out, especially once you memorize their limited patterns.\r\nNeverAwake mixes clean low-poly 3D graphics with high definition hand drawn 2D sprites that are largely grotesque and unsettling, appropriate for its traumatic symbolization. Together with the smooth clean UI and the impressive display of fireworks with the bullet hell effects, the overall aesthetic results in a sleek and flashy artistic visual design.\r\nNeverAwake is an addicting shoot ’em up with a smart byte-sized level design and an engaging progression system. A game that is both highly rewarding and accessible. Beautifully grotesque, charming, and imaginative.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4272696) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "A classic JRPG from the PS2 and PSP era has now been brought forward in time, re-released and remastered for modern systems, and in my opinion, they ported the wrong version.\r\nIt’s a questionable design decision from the makers why they chose to port and remaster only exactly Persona 3 Portable for the PSP, instead of the much more detailed Persona 3 for the PS2, with its 3D explorable environments during normal-life sequences and fully animated 3D cutscenes.\r\nThe Portable version is not without its improvements though, with the addition of a female character option complete with an altered story and controllable party members. I was half expecting that they will combine both aspects together and come up with a sort-of Persona 3 Royal, but alas, this was not what had transpired.\r\nThe storytelling experience of Persona 3 Portable mostly resembles playing a visual novel or even watching an anime. It’s a passable experience and somewhat still entertaining, especially when you factor in the amazing upbeat soundtrack, but I can’t help but think that it’s such a downgrade from the original in-game 3D sequences. If it’s any consolation, at least the navigation is much faster since the setup is now point-and-click instead of actual 3D free roam.\r\nPersona 3 Portable is a heavily narrative-driven game that focuses on a group of characters with special abilities, including the player named main character. Most of them can summon a personal mystical being called ‘Personas’ to battle monsters called 'Shadows' while in the Dark Hour; a mysterious hidden time period that occurs during midnight between each passing day — time is paused, and only select people can perceive it alongside a much different world than normal.\r\nThe characters are mainly investigating a dark hour labyrinth called Tartarus which sets the stage for the dungeon crawling aspect of Persona 3. You explore the dungeon along with your party mates, either as a group or split — if they’re powerful enough to survive on their own. Hitting or getting hit by a roaming monster will activate a battle instance.\r\nThese aforementioned battles are turn-based. Attacks can either be a basic attack or one of many skills, performed thanks to the character’s summoned Personas.\r\nCompared to the singular Persona of the NPC party members, the main character has the ability to summon many different Personas at a time, with the capability to collect them as cards and even fuse them together to build new ones. As with traditional JRPGs, there is a complex rock-paper-scissors weakness system in place.\r\nThe battles are tactical and engaging. Playing on normal difficulty, Persona 3 Portable presents a formidable challenge to the player and will require careful planning in bringing in consumables, strategic selection of skills, personas, and decision making in pushing through the dungeons or maybe resting for now, living to fight another day.\r\nWhen you’re not battling monsters in the dark hour, you are put in a slice-of-life setting where you need to go about your daily life as a student. Maintain friendships with schoolmates, attend school to study, join clubs, and visit other places in town. A traditional visual novel gameplay.\r\nThese aren’t just inconsequential mini-games or additional flavor detached from the actual gameplay mechanics, these activities that you do outside battles will affect your character’s stats and attributes, such as your ability to collect and form new Personas, or change and improve skills.\r\nI feel bad for complaining, but for an important game that put its makers on the map as a JRPG powerhouse, this re-release was a wasted opportunity with how the content was handled. Persona 3 deserved better. In any case, Persona 3 Portable is still a worthy game to play that will take you roughly over 50 plus hours to finish. It is still addicting once you get hooked by the story and the dungeon crawling. Especially if you're a series latecomer itching for more Persona content that you have missed.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4276598) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Originally released for the PS2 very late in its lifecycle, Persona 4 has since been re-released for the PS Vita years later and more recently on PC a few years ago. Now, Persona 4 Golden is finally widely accessible, having just been released for the PS4, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch yesterday.\r\nUnlike its predecessor Persona 3 which has also just been rereleased alongside this one, Persona 4 Golden is from the full console version and not a portable nor toned down product. It is a fully fledged 3D JRPG, from the exploration, cutscenes, down to the combat.  Well, except for a few anime style cutscenes.\r\nThe graphics and visuals have aged a bit, but still passable as a modern game especially if you’re looking for a great story and gameplay anyway. That distinct Persona-style upbeat soundtrack is back as well.\r\nPersona 4 Golden continues the series tradition of mixing life-sim gameplay with fantasy JRPG elements. Way different from other JRPG games where you’re a full time hero, or other life-sim games where you’re just a regular dude all the way. This balance between extraordinary and ordinary life gives Persona 4 a relatable approach to the player.\r\nThe game puts us in the shoes of the player-named protagonist, a transfer student coming from the big city and into the quiet town of Inaba. Giving it a more grounded and simple premise than other Persona games.\r\nMost of the daytime is spent on your normal-life, interacting with friends, attending school, and visiting places in town; improving your character, building relationships, or just doing stuff for fun, but this slice-of-life setting is soon every so often disturbed by a series of mysterious events, turning it into a compelling murder mystery thriller owing to a series of deaths happening across the town. A very intriguing element to drive the story forward and keep the player at the edge of their seat.\r\nAlong with the protagonist, he also meets other interesting characters, some with the same ability as him. The ability to summon a personal mystical being called ‘Personas’ to battle monsters called 'Shadows'. Together, they need to solve the mystery behind these deaths and maybe prevent other deaths from happening, as well as its connection to a hidden TV dimension that permeates the Televisions in the town.\r\nThis hidden TV dimension is accessible by the characters via physically entering a widescreen TV at the local mall, allowing the characters to investigate, explore, battle monsters, and try to save others from danger — forming the core dungeon crawling element of the game.\r\nThe initial dungeon crawler sets you up with the exploration, but as soon as you attack or get hit by a monster, you now enter a turn-based battle system.\r\nThe combat of Persona 4 Golden is tactical and engaging. You can do a basic attack, or perform one of the many skills powered by each character’s respective Personas. You can also use items such as healing, boosters, or revival potions as well as analyze your enemies and change your tactics.\r\nAdditionally, the main character can collect and use other personas and even fuse them together to create new ones. The weakness system is back, where each character and enemy will have their own weaknesses that you can exploit against, allowing you to stun enemies and give you additional moves.\r\nA game filled with mystery, life, and death that will keep you busy for more than 50 hours of gameplay. Persona 4 Golden is an amazing JRPG, perhaps one of the best. A narrative-driven game that not only excels in its intriguing storytelling and engaging combat, but also in its relatable life-sim gameplay and a wonderful roster of characters.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4286004) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "You’ve read it right, 70s. If you were somehow already a gamer in the 1970s, you might have played one of the most influential video games of all time in Colossal Cave Adventure. This newly released title is a remake of that classic text-based adventure.\r\n3D graphics, modern gameplay, with big names attached to it, one being Roberta Williams — the Founder of Sierra, basically the mother of point-and-click adventure games. The original game is what basically inspired her to make adventure games, and now she’s the one remaking it, full circle… you can't go wrong right? Well, I’ll just let my review speak for itself.\r\nColossal Cave is indeed a faithful remake of that old classic. You are an adventurer trying to find and collect the many different treasures hidden within the Colossal Cave. The Colossal Cave is big and spacious, with many hidden passages and extensive mazes for you to explore and figure out. At the end of the playthrough, you are scored depending on the treasures you’ve found.\r\nEvery line of text from the original game has been directly translated into audio and visual form. Everything is now narrated and can finally be seen visually. The voice-over narration is done perfectly and something that you might have probably imagined if you’ve played the original. The environments are accurately modeled based on the original text descriptions.\r\nUnfortunately, the archaic and primitive game design from almost 50 years ago hasn’t aged very well and it is clearly evident with the puzzle solving logic — Completely outside the realm of logic and reasonable thinking. Most of the solutions are frustratingly random in nature.\r\nInstead of stimulating your mind, you just end up trying every action or item you have on every interactable entity in the environment. There is also an added random enemy encounter system that is a bit unnecessary but workable, and an auto-map style system to aid players in their exploration.\r\nGraphics wise, instead of jumping from the 70s to 2023, Colossal Cave came up short and landed somewhere in the 2000s with its PS3 style graphics and bland lighting system in place. Passable, yes, but not quite the grand re-imagining one would expect, especially when you factor in the importance of the game and the people involved.\r\nColossal Cave stays true to its roots and it's a nice homage to one that started the genre, but 50 years is a bit too long of a time already to not reinvent and overhaul things. If there is a hard limit on how old a game should be before a faithful remake will seem like a bad idea instead of a good one, this is probably it.\r\nIf you’re an old timer who wants to relive that 70s gaming experience again with a powerful nostalgic trip, and have extra cash to burn with the game's aggressive pricing, It might be something worth looking into. Otherwise, steer clear.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4288482) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "A Space for the Unbound is the story of a boy and a girl — both with supernatural powers — in a slice-of-life turned fantasy romance adventure against a 90’s Indonesian backdrop. A nice change of setting from the usual Japanese-themed similar works of art, like the popular Makoto Shinkai Anime movies Your Name and Weathering with You, all embodied in video game format.\r\nThe game is very heavy on the narrative side and is centered on the couple Atma and Raya’s magical journey of discovery, loss, and hope. Mystery upon mystery is presented to the player right from the start that spurs curiosity, leaving the player wanting more answers that slowly unravel as you push through the gameplay to experience the story.\r\nAcross the beautiful Indonesian town, you will meet and help various characters with their own backstories and struggles. The look and feel of Indonesian culture is amazingly captured in this rendition and the pixel art style along with the melodramatic atmosphere soundtrack are equally as amazing.\r\nThe beautiful pixel art is intricately animated and the sound artfully designed, both with strong attention to detail. Even things as simple as the character stopping from a running motion has gravitas to it. The grass swaying in the distance, the pedestrians, the traffic, all doing their own living, breathing, in the background. They made the world as alive as they can get with the art style.\r\nThe video game format of A Space for the Unbound as a container for the amazing narrative works for the most part. It plays like a point-and-click game but with modern movement controls. Move using the arrow keys or analog sticks and interacting by pressing a button. You are free to explore the different areas of the town in a side scrolling setup, and can head in either of the four cardinal directions to switch areas.\r\nThe core gameplay progression is anchored by the environmental and situational puzzles, by completing a specific order of actions to progress. For example, needing a tool or an object so that you can climb an obstacle to proceed.\r\nThere are other interesting mechanics as well as high tension situations to enliven the gameplay from time to time, like a sneaking scene, a QTE fighting segment, or the use of the Atma’s magic book to dive into someone’s inner mind.\r\nWithout a fast travel system, the back and forth could get a bit exhausting, especially for some of the longer set pieces. That’s basically my only gripe with A Space for the Unbound. Even my woes with the puzzle solving ultimately boils down to the amount of back and forth-ing needed to get some items and solve the puzzles.\r\nI kind of wish they had a story mode only option for those who want to just relax and experience the storytelling, without the nuisances of having to play a game. I hope somebody adapts it into an anime so that non-gamers can also experience the story.\r\nA Space for the Unbound is a memorable experience with its unique setting, emotional story, and beautiful art style. Truly a must have for anyone who likes good storytelling, slice-of-life elements, and won’t mind a pixel art style. A great indie-game to start the year with.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4287652) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "HITMAN World of Assassination is a stealth-action sandbox game that puts us in the shoes of the genetically engineered clone named Agent 47, a highly skilled assassin working for an organization called the International Contract Agency. The whole premise is centered around Agent 47 taking different contracts across the globe, setting the stage for the different multinational sandbox levels that acts as our murder playground.\r\nThe sandbox setup for the levels is Hitman’s trademark gameplay style, where you are free to experiment and do your own style of assassinations. You are just given the target(s) and placed in an open world sandbox map with varying degrees of openness and map design. For example, the first level is a very crowded palace hosting a fashion show, while the next level on the other hand is a public destination set in Europe with different buildings and establishments that you can enter.\r\nYou can either go loud or silent with your approach, In stealth you can use disguises, distractions, or just pure sneaking prowess; in killing, where you can use a high caliber sniper from a far, stage an accident using the environment, or just simply poison your target. The options the game gives you are almost infinite in possibilities.\r\nThe entire gameplay setup is entertaining enough on its own, just like the classic Hitman games. But it doesn’t just end there, as HITMAN World of Assassination features a deep progression system that is filled with different types of gear and gadgets to unlock just by playing the game; Trying to achieve decent ranking at the end of each level , or completing the different unique challenges, like trying to kill the target with a specific weapon. You might even spend hours and hours replaying the same mission trying to experiment all while mastering the layout.\r\nAside from the creative gameplay or the addicting progression system, there is also the overarching story of Agent 47 that divides the levels into three campaigns.\r\nBefore, there were three games in the recent Hitman trilogy. Now, these three games have been merged into one game named HITMAN World of Assassination. The base game of Hitman 3 has been converted to that title, with the two previous games included already as playable levels, free for Hitman 3 owners.\r\nIt's a great deal, especially for those who haven’t gotten around to playing the whole trilogy, or have started it at 1 and have not been able to continue playing the sequels. That means 21 sandbox levels are available for you to play along with 3 campaigns and a couple of side and bonus missions. If you buy the deluxe pack, you even get more missions.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4353212) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Remove all the base building, crafting, focus on the shooter aspect, make it darker with lovecraftian elements and you get Death in the Water 2.\r\nDeath in the Water 2 starts slow and uninteresting. The introductory plot exposition is just unstimulating white lines of text displayed at your screen to read; no visuals, no narration. This goes on far too long, like a minute or two. Afterwards, there is a tutorial segment that I would say is not the best example of gameplay to get a player hooked on, you just are ordered to kill 10 hard-to-find fishes and hard-to-find treasure chests.\r\nThe gameplay loop largely stays the same, it consists of starting a mission in a much more passive exploration phase, in which you are trying to find treasure chests scattered in the area in order to afford upgrading your gear. Along the way you will also see other harmless creatures that populate the area. Then, the wave shooter element begins where you are attacked by a variety of sea creatures and you’d have to fight them.  Complete it to proceed to the next mission, rinse and repeat.\r\nThe combat is more methodical, your weapon is not an agent of destruction. It reloads slowly and does not always one shot the enemy. Your oxygen and ammo are limited, and you’d have to find and loot supply drops scattered along the sea surface. You cannot surface above the water as well to find reprieve. So far this gameplay loop is all there is, without much variation.\r\nDeath in the Water 2's graphics and sound design are phenomenal and impressive considering this was just made by two people. They really captured the underwater aesthetic and feeling exceptionally well. It's dark and scary, just like real-life but still light enough for it to accommodate the gameplay. The environments are also well designed; visually, they look realistic and believable as an underwater landscape; Mechanically, they are dynamic enough to provide a decent arena for the player to battle with the sea creatures.\r\nSo far, the atmosphere of this game is intense, scary, and immersive. The gameplay feels smooth mechanically with well designed animations especially for the sea creatures. However, the main gameplay loop leaves much to be desired with a repetitive and uninteresting experience.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

It got the Resident Evil 2 Remake treatment and even surpassed that in my opinion.\r\nPeople always saw Dead Space as just Resident Evil 4 in space, but really, it was a classic game in its own right that also advanced over the shoulder survival horror even further, especially with its creative limb cutting mechanic that became the core identity of the series. Callisto Protocol tried to take the crown a few weeks ago, and the OG just had to show us how it's done again. In a shocking turn of events, EA has done it with Dead Space Remake.\r\nRight off the bat we are presented with an amazing introduction scene that evokes our curiosity and brings out tension. Introducing us to the main characters including our player, Systems Engineer Isaac Clarke - now fully voiced - as well as our soon-to-be slaughterhouse, the enormous mining ship USG Ishimura.\r\nUSG Ishimura has gone dark, and a small shuttle has been dispatched in order to check and repair the mining ship. Isaac Clarke and the rest of the shuttle’s crew goes on a repair mission, only to discover a gruesome fate of the Ishimura’s crew, all horribly killed and infected by an alien plague.\r\nComparing it to the original, everything is faithfully retold, but with some welcome twists in gameplay and story – both minor and major — and of course: the massive improvements to the visuals. The core gameplay and controls has been largely untouched except for the item and progression system that has been reworked for a more modern era. The levels are largely the same on the macro scale, but on a granular level, there are lots of positive remixes to the map, puzzle, and enemy layout to make it fresh for everyone, even for old timers.\r\nThe visuals are stunning, even darker and more gruesome than the original. From Isaac’s highly detailed suit, to the terrifying Necromorphs and horrifying bloody dismemberments. There is more detail in just about everything. Hallways are now scarier than ever, with a more realistic dark lighting that fits well with the run down nature of the USG Ishimura, giving you a feeling of uneasiness and worry that something is lurking on every dark corner, waiting for the chance to surprise you.\r\nSo far, Dead Space Remake is set to be another hit for the series. Tailored to both long-time fans and newcomers alike, it is a masterful example on how to remake a classic game and leverage genre maturity and modern technology to make it even better.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

Remove all the base building, crafting, and focus on the shooter aspect. Make it darker with lovecraftian elements and you get Death in the Water 2.\r\nAt the outset, I thought the game was set in antiquity, like in the age of pirates and the golden age of exploration, but soon I found out that it was actually set in modern times, clearly evident with the radio communication and high tech gear that the main character uses along with his backup contact at the surface.\r\nI guess humans can’t swim very fast\r\nDeath in the Water 2 starts slow and uninteresting. The introductory plot exposition is just unstimulating white lines of text displayed at your screen to read; no visuals, no narration. This  felt so stretched out and was a bit longer than I anticipated that it made such a negative impact. The introduction just basically sets up the premise and the narrative ends there.\r\nAfterwards, there is a tutorial segment that is as equally as slow. Something that I would say is not the best example of gameplay to get a player hooked on. You just are ordered to kill 10 hard-to-find fishes and hard-to-find treasure chests. There is a bit of voice acting during the tutorial, but that’s all there is, after that, it’s now laser focused on the wave shooter-esque aspect throughout the entirety of the game.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay loop — which is the main focus of the game — largely stays the same, it consists of starting a mission in a much more passive exploration phase, in which you are trying to find treasure chests scattered in the open world in order to afford upgrading your gear. Along the way you will also see other harmless creatures that populate the area.\r\nAfter a bit of exploration, the wave shooter element begins where you are attacked by a variety of sea creatures and you’d have to fight them. Complete it to proceed to the next mission, rinse and repeat this for ten plus missions and that’s about it.\r\nIt will take you around five hours to complete a Death in the Water 2 playthrough. And by “a playthrough”, I mean there is some semblance of replayability in mind, with its scoring system, ending, and open-ended gameplay. But considering the already repetitive nature of the gameplay throughout the first playthrough, it’s not really well suited to be a replayable type of game.\r\nTactical but too easy at the same time\r\nThe combat is more methodical, your weapon is not an agent of destruction. It fires and reloads slowly and does not always one shot the enemy. Although across the game you can also acquire other weapons aside from the typical one-shot harpoon, like semi automatic shotguns, and slightly faster-rate spearguns that you can use, depending on the occassion.\r\nSome enemies will have the ability to attack you from a distance instead of the usual lounging melee attack, but more often than not, they’re already dead from your harpoon gun before they can even attack you. In short, the game is too easy, and you’re too overpowered, even if the weapons are as slow and methodical as they are already.\r\nOn the other side of the difficulty scale, your oxygen and ammo are limited, and you’d have to find and loot supply drops scattered along the sea surface. You cannot surface above the water as well to find reprieve. This gameplay loop is all there is throughout the ten plus missions, without much variation.\r\nTechnical Analysis\r\nDeath in the Water 2's graphics and sound design are phenomenal and impressive considering this was just made by two people. They really captured the underwater aesthetic and feeling exceptionally well. It's dark and scary, just like real-life but still light enough for it to accommodate the gameplay. The environments are also well designed; visually, they look realistic and believable as an underwater landscape; Mechanically, they are dynamic enough to provide a decent arena for the player to battle with the sea creatures, with coral reefs and caves as cool hiding spots and covers.\r\nBest in class animations\r\nThe sea creatures are beautifully animated. These animations are probably the best I’ve seen for video game sea creatures. They are very fluid and life-like. The animations, the physics, matching it with the movement all checks out. Even the transition from live animation to ragdoll physics when dying is seamless. Clearly out of the uncanny valley when it comes to realism.  This is highly impressive considering sea creatures are I think among the hardest ones to imitate.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4377787) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "In a world full of disappointing sequels, reboots, and spiritual successors. We have one of the rarest examples of a franchise that has gotten better in time in HITMAN World of Assassination.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Three games for the price of one\r\n- The best the stealth genre has to offer\r\n- Open-ended gameplay with an abundance of choices presented to the player\r\n- Unique open-world sandbox levels each with their own layers of variety\r\n- Highly replayable\r\n## Cons\r\n- Minor production problems in the second game that affected the storytelling presentation\r\nThe classics were all great and memorable in their own right with their innovative gameplay and unique sandbox levels. The one considered the black sheep of the series in Hitman Absolution, also had a great impact in the series by attracting a new generation of audiences thanks to its streamlined controls and mechanics. Now, the developers - IO Interactive - have combined the best aspect of all those games in crafting the new Hitman Trilogy.\r\nThree games for the price of one\r\nThere are three games in the recent Hitman trilogy. Owning any title in the trilogy will allow you access its ported content in any later titles. You can play Hitman 1 levels in Hitman 2, and you can play both Hitman 1 and 2 levels in Hitman 3, including all the minor gameplay and graphical improvements.\r\nNow, the three games have been merged into one game named HITMAN World of Assassination. The base Hitman 3 has been converted to that title, with the two previous games included already as playable levels, free for Hitman 3 owners.\r\nHITMAN World of Assassination, or the series as a whole, is a stealth-action sandbox game series that puts us in the shoes of the genetically engineered clone named Agent 47, a highly skilled assassin working for an organization called the International Contract Agency. The entire premise of the franchise is centered around Agent 47 taking different contracts across the globe, setting the stage for the different multinational sandbox levels that acts as our stealth murder playground.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nThe sandbox setup for the level of HITMAN World of Assassination is its trademark gameplay style, where you are free to experiment and do your own style of assassinations. You are just given the target(s) and placed in an open world sandbox map with varying degrees of openness and map design that will keep you busy for hours, especially if you like to experiment and explore the possibilities of the map.\r\nSome maps will even have two or more varieties in them, layer after layer; for example, you might find a laboratory, hidden inside a cave, under a mobster mansion, located on an Italian seaside tourist spot open world map. Giving you immense freedom and engaging you like no other stealth game.\r\nHitman’s levels will take you to multiple locations across continents. Ranging from a typical American suburb or a luxury Thai hotel, to a densely packed fashion show in Paris or a secret society meeting on a private island, most of them are usually either heavily guarded, a public place, or a social event. It’s a nice thing to be able to alternate between different locations and cultures level after level, providing a lot of map variety both visually and mechanically.\r\nThe abundance of options the game gives you are almost infinite in possibilities. Whether it be in stealth where you can either go loud or silent, use disguises taken from almost any NPCs, distractions, or pure sneaking prowess; In killing where you can use a high caliber sniper from a far, stage an accident using the environment, or just simply poison your target.\r\n## The progression system\r\nWhile the entire gameplay setup is entertaining enough on its own just like the classic Hitman games, it doesn’t just end there, as Hitman features a deep progression system that is filled with different types of gear and gadgets to unlock just by playing the game; Trying to achieve decent ranking at the end of each level or completing the different unique challenges, like trying to kill the target with a specific weapon, or causing a specific event to happen. You might even spend hours and hours replaying the same mission trying to experiment, all while mastering the layout.\r\n## New Game Mode\r\nAnd as if the game isn’t sandbox enough, there is also a sort of an endgame rogue-like mode called Freelancer where the campaign and levels are truly sandbox and randomized. There are minimal scripted events and no more narrative driving it forward. You also have a personal hideout / safehouse wherein you can customize and personalize to your liking. This is a separate mode that is almost a game of its own and breathes another life into it.\r\n## The Narrative\r\nAside from the creative gameplay or the addicting progression system, there is also the overarching story of Agent 47 that divides the levels into three campaigns. One that deals with Agent 47’s personal relationships and history, with an intriguing mystery that goes deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, culminating in the third campaign.\r\nDue to budget issues during the production of the second game, Hitman 2’s cutscenes were severely affected, going from Hitman 1’s photorealistic CGI cutscenes to somewhat static slideshows to tell the story. Fortunately, Hitman 3’s cutscenes have found a middle ground between the two, and just used an enhanced render of the in-engine graphics for the cutscenes.\r\nThis story is actually decent despite being simple: just your typical revenge / digging-into-the-past cliche. Unfortunately, it is largely overshadowed by the amazing gameplay, ultimately becoming something that just serves to move the gameplay forward and jump between different levels. If you repeat a level enough times, you might even actually forget about the story.\r\n## Technical Analysis\r\nDespite being heavily CPU bound due to its sandbox and simulation nature, HITMAN ran exceptionally well on my system. (RTX 3080, i7-8700k, 32GB Ram). It also has proper support for all the niche PC features that one might expect like DLSS, FSR, and Ultrawide resolutions. The current-gen looking graphics have been mostly retained throughout the three games, with almost no discernable differences, aside from the added ray tracing support.\r\nIt's a great deal, especially for those who haven’t gotten around to playing the whole trilogy, or have started it at 1 and have not been able to continue playing the sequels. That means 21 sandbox levels are available for you to play, along with 3 campaigns and a couple of side and bonus missions. If you buy the deluxe pack, you even get more missions.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nThe current peak of the Hitman series, HITMAN World of Assassination keeps the stealth-genre alive and kicking with its creative open-ended gameplay and a delightful collection of sandbox levels to explore, experiment, and master. All bundled in an incredibly good deal.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4388749) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Released in Early Access today, Superfuse is a brand new Action RPG that combines cell-shaded comic-book art style, looter elements, with some action packed hack ’n slash mechanics.\r\nWe start off by choosing and creating our character by selecting from one of the three available classes called Enforcers: The Berserker, a warrior/melee archetype; The Elementalist, who is basically the mage type; and a Technomancer, which is the necromancer / summoner class. You can either play offline or online, a highly appreciated feature. Although there is no way to transfer a character from offline to online and vice versa once you have made your decision.\r\nSuperfuse is set in a science-fiction setting, a departure from the medieval fantasy setting that most ARPGs use. However, don’t let the sci-fi and comic book element fool you as it is still every bit as gory, bloody, and magical as those fantastical settings. The gory nature is immediately evident even in just the first mob you kill, essentially turning it into a highly exaggerated blood splatter - a visual trend that is consistent across the game. You also have typical magic skills like Meteor – especially with the Elementalist – despite the sci-fi setting.\r\nThere is no controller support (but it is planned) and no option for WASD movement, so it plays more like a classic point and click ARPG like Diablo II. The story is light and I didn’t see any heavy narrative driving the game, but it's mainly about an outbreak of zombies called “Corrupted” roaming around the town of Eros that you and with friends optionally, as Enforcer, have to clear. Throughout the Early Access campaign, you will take on different missions that will revolve around this goal. All while leveling up and making your character more powerful.\r\nThe main attraction of this game, as with the name \"Superfuse\", is the ability to “Fuse” skills with DNA upgrades conveniently called Fuses that can modify it in different ways; like stat boosts, adding additional projectiles, extending the range of the skill, and many more. These are basically what you call gems or runes in other RPG games.\r\nThere is a campaign / story mode already playable partially, with an endgame system also available for players to try early after the partial campaign ends, even if the story is not yet fully complete. There are a lot of negative reviews on Steam right now because there are on-going server problems, so the online aspect is currently affected as of writing.\r\nThere is clearly a good foundation already in place with this Early Access release. Superfuse is basically feature complete mechanically, with a fully functioning combat system that is satisfying to play and visually appealing to see. The characters available are partially equipped skill-wise, and with what's available, are all fun to experiment with.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

It is a remake of the 2008 classic, which was released with critical acclaim. Continued by another amazing game in 2011 with Dead Space 2, followed by a mixed reception to the third game in 2013, in which the franchise has been on hiatus since until now.\r\nIs the remake worth revisiting? Is it a worthy first impression for franchise newcomers?\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful retelling of the original\r\n- The story is more fleshed out and improved compared to the original\r\n- An immersive atmospheric experience\r\n- Terrifying as a survival horror game\r\n- Tailored to both long-time fans and newcomers## Cons\r\n-No cons\r\nMassive expectations, all met\r\nI was a bit worried that the remake will not be able to live up to the massive expectations, considering it has some big shoes to fill — The original Dead Space being one of the greatest video games ever made — and the fact that EA is producing it, and we all know EA. In a surprising turn of events, the stars have aligned just right and we somehow got a masterpiece of a game with the remake.\r\nDead Space remake is a faithful retelling of the original, but that’s not to say nothing has been changed, as it’s also a complete revamp of the original. Graphically, practically everything has been rebuilt from scratch and the graphics are on par with today’s standards, saying it lightly. The gameplay has been refined for the better. The story is more fleshed out. They had a great foundation of a game already and I’m glad they didn’t reinvent it for reinvention’s sake.\r\nPeople always saw Dead Space as just Resident Evil 4 in space, but really, it was a classic game in its own right that also advanced over the shoulder survival horror even further, especially with its creative limb cutting mechanic that became the core identity of the series. Callisto Protocol tried to take the crown a few weeks ago, and the OG just had to show us how it's done again. It got the Resident Evil 2 Remake treatment and even surpassed that in my opinion.\r\nIt’s the same game, but not the same game.\r\nWhile it is still definitely the Dead Space: third-person survival horror that we all know and love, there are some welcome twists in gameplay and story – both minor and major — and of course: the massive improvements to the visuals.\r\nAt the start, we are presented with an amazing introduction scene that evokes our curiosity and brings out tension, similar to the original, but looking way more atmospheric and immersive. Introducing us to the main characters including our player, Systems Engineer Isaac Clarke, as well as our soon-to-be slaughterhouse, the enormous mining ship USG Ishimura.\r\nUSG Ishimura has gone dark, and a small shuttle has been dispatched in order to check and repair the mining ship. Isaac Clarke and the rest of the shuttle’s crew goes on a repair mission, only to discover a gruesome fate of the Ishimura’s crew, all horribly killed and infected by an alien plague.\r\nMuch of the overarching story element has been retained, but there are some changes and additions to further flesh out the story. Some characters are given bigger roles now, there is a new crew member in the shuttle, and some sections and set pieces have been further expanded. Isaac also has more dialogue now, and takes his helmet more often. Not anymore the silent or the faceless protagonist type like in the original. Take that, Master Chief, Doom Guy, and Gordon Freeman!\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe core gameplay and controls has been largely untouched except for the item and progression system that has been reworked for a more modern era; New upgrades, alternative fire modes, and a weapon unlocking system that is in line more with the story — instead of having to buy them first in the store.\r\nThe core staple of the series - the cutting of limbs, is more gorier than before. The methodical combat of cutting down the Necromorph's limbs in order to slow down them, eventually permanently incapacitating them for good, is all too satisfying and engaging. This unique combat flow is unmatchable by other survival horror shooters, or even just typical shooters in general, where the only important thing are headshots.\r\nThe levels are largely the same on the macro scale, but on a granular level, there are lots of positive remixes to the map, puzzle, and enemy layout to make it fresh for everyone, even for old timers.\r\nThere are now random events that you will encounter, powered by an AI Director, similar to one found in Valve’s Left 4 Dead, wherein depending on your location and situation, this director can spawn and basically “direct” dynamic encounters throughout your playthrough.\r\nThere are new areas, new nooks that you can discover, as well as the fact you can seamlessly play through the entire game and map without loading screens, giving you that added immersion and feeling that the USG Ishimura is a real enormous place.\r\nThe visuals are stunning, even darker and more gruesome than the original. From Isaac’s highly detailed suit, to the terrifying Necromorphs and horrifying bloody dismemberments.\r\nThere is more detail in just about everything. Hallways are now scarier than ever, with a more realistic dark lighting that fits well with the run down nature of the USG Ishimura, giving you a feeling of uneasiness and worry that something is lurking on every dark corner, waiting for the chance to surprise you. And it WILL surprise you, countless times.\r\nAll in all, you can expect Dead Space Remake to keep you busy for around 15 hours until completion, more if you plan to replay it in a New Game Plus mode, with harder enemies and a hidden ending to unlock.\r\nPC Performance\r\nUnlike the recent stutterfest Callisto Protocol, Dead Space Remake ran without any problems on my system. (i7-8700k, RTX 3080, 32GB). It even ran decently on the Steam Deck, provided that you do some minor tweaking. It has proper support for DLSS and FSR, so it is possible to reach higher FPS ranges especially the 100s even with a conservative PC build. I tried it with both keyboard/mouse and gamepad layouts and felt the game is more optimized and better suited for controllers.\r\nNow I’m torn between wanting a proper remake of Dead Space 2 and 3, or a full-blown Dead Space 4. Maybe they should take the Capcom route and just do things simultaneously.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4400724) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "There is a new SpongeBob game in town, and it is the spiritual successor to 2020's Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated, which is in itself a remake of the original 2003 Battle for Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a 3D platformer game that is based on the Nickelodeon animated series SpongeBob SquarePants.\r\nYou control the titular character SpongeBob, in his quest to restore his town of Bikini Bottom to normality, after a magic wishing mishap that caused his universe to collide with other alternate universes. Universes that SpongeBob must to travel to and visit. It seems that multiversal adventures are the craze these days.\r\nSpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake’s gameplay is a typical 3D platformer, which is extremely similar to games like Crash Bandicoot or Spyro the Dragon.  A remnant of the glory platforming days of the PS1 and PS2 eras. Jumping across platforms, avoiding obstacles, using movement maneuvers like double jump, gliding, or dashes to navigate, and occasionally smashing boxes to get Jelly: the main collectible/currency, similar to coins or fruits in other games.\r\nThere are semblances of puzzle solving mechanics but the game never fully commits to it, resulting in a relatively easy level progression. Which honestly, isn’t a bad thing as the flow is continuous and the energetic momentum is easily maintained throughout levels.\r\nThe controls are highly responsive for the most part, and I never really had any difficulties in controlling SpongeBob. My only gripe is some bindings are a bit off for me, especially with how the Dodge/Dash is bound on the same button as the Jump-Slam attack. It messes with years of muscle memory of using a Jump+Dash combo, which can lead you to death many times because you instinctively tried to dash forward while in the air, only instead you dive down to your death.\r\nThe combat on the other hand is simplistic, you just mostly use a basic spinning main attack like Crash Bandicoot to one shot most enemies, but is modernized and made more engaging by just this one simple addition, a dodge mechanic.\r\nGraphics wise, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is pristine looking and the lighting is amazing. It could easily pass as a Live Action or CGI quality animation and while it doesn’t look exactly like the 2D animated series, they’ve done the transition from 2D to 3D justice.\r\nWhen I am playing SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, the feeling is still there, like I am watching the good ol’ cartoons. The voice actors are the same, the sound bits are the same, the jokes are still on point, and the overall atmosphere is still SpongeBob SquarePants. It genuinely felt like I was watching one of the episodes. It doesn’t hold a candle to the previous game, Battle for Bikini Bottom, but it’s so far a decent follow-up nonetheless.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

However, don’t let the sci-fi and comic book element fool you as it is still every bit as gory, bloody, and magical as those fantastical settings.

When combined with all the other skill effects and comic-book font damage numbers, It mostly leads to visual clutter that is blocking a lot of what’s happening.\r\nA triumvirate of characters\r\nWe start off by choosing and creating our character by selecting from one of the three available classes called Enforcers: The Berserker, a warrior archetype focused on melee; The Elementalist, who is basically the mage type focused on ranged and casted skills; and The Technomancer, which is the necromancer / summoner class specializing in controlling minions.\r\nGameplay Analysis and Features\r\nThe Berserker is the most kinetic fun character out of the three because of its up close melee combat. The Elementalist is the most visually appealing because of the flashy colorful spells, while the Technomancer is the most versatile with its wide range of summons and damage dealers.\r\nYou can either play offline or online, a highly appreciated feature. Although there is no way to transfer a character from offline to online and vice versa once you have made your decision. There are a lot of negative reviews on Steam right now because there are on-going server problems, so the online aspect is currently affected as of writing.\r\nThere is no controller support (but it is planned) and no option for WASD movement, so it plays more like a classic point and click ARPG like Diablo II. The story is light and I didn’t see any heavy narrative driving the game, but it's mainly about an outbreak of zombies called “Corrupted” roaming around the town of Eros that you, Enforcers, have to clear, with up to four players total cooperatively. Across the Early Access campaign, you will take on different missions that will revolve around this goal. All while leveling up from 1 to 30 and making your character more powerful.\r\nSuperfuse your DNA\r\nThe main attraction of the gameplay, as with the name \"Superfuse\", is the ability to “Fuse” skills with DNA upgrades conveniently called Fuses that can modify it in different ways; like stat boosts, adding additional projectiles, making them homing, extending the range of the skill, and many more. And you are not limited to one or two only, you can combine multiple fuses together, as long as you got the skill points. These are basically what you call gems or runes in other RPG games, but much more expanded and free. As if you are the developer trying to create skills and its effects from scratch.\r\nThis system basically allows you to “Tailor your skills to fit your unique preferences”, which gives the game a multitude of gameplay style opportunities when factoring in the amount of Skill-Fuse permutations that the game offers, even if it only has three character classes. The overall combat loop is entertaining enough for an ARPG, and lands somewhere between Diablo II and III, but with more freedom and customization. Although the pacing of the progression especially in the earlier parts of the game could still be improved.\r\nA good foundation in place\r\nThere is a campaign / story mode already playable partially, with an endgame system also available for players to try early after the incomplete campaign ends.  The endgame is already in a playable style which gives us a nice sneak peek of its potential replayability once it's released; After the story ends, you gain access to the Solar Map to take on endless contracts for new loot and upgrades.\r\nThere is clearly a good foundation already in place with this Early Access release. Superfuse is basically feature-complete mechanically, with a fully functioning combat system that is satisfying to play and visually appealing to see. The characters available are partially equipped skill-wise, and with what's available, are all fun to experiment with.\r\nWith many of the future features still open-ended and subject to player feedback, there will be less feedback if there aren’t any early adopters due to the high price. Ultimately, It’s a game teeming with potential, but its high price point can be tough pill to swallow for many.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4419250) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Asdivine Saga is the latest standalone entry in the somewhat popular and at the same time obscure retro-style JRPG series Asdivine. While made primarily for and popular on mobile platforms, most of the games were also released on PC and consoles but turned out not quite as popular.\r\nAsdivine Saga starts us off with the typical upbeat introduction of the main character, Vyse, an already established hot-headed fighter by the time the game starts. It wastes no time immersing us in the story and the stakes involved. You see, Vyse lives in Nondia, a neutral territory far from the warring kingdoms of Lightoria and Zandark (“light” and “dark”, I see what you did there). Both kingdoms are trying to recruit Nondians to their cause, and Vyse is caught in the middle of the conflict.\r\nThere is a hidden power at play here, one that seems to be influencing both sides of the war, and it's up to our hero and his ragtag party of mostly cute and interesting female fighters to investigate this and maybe, save the world from the horrors of full-scale global war.\r\nThe gameplay is retro-inspired and the setup best resembles Final Fantasy VI with its beautiful 2D art-style where you can roam around in the levels in traditional 2D exploration, and an Overworld segment to travel across the continent. It also has an instanced turn-based combat system with attack, skill, magic, and item options. Your party is on the right side, the enemies on the left. No special patented mechanic or whatnot and a pretty standard experience so far. During the exploration parts, you can also swap characters to control them instead of the main character\r\nWhile the gameplay has a lot of modern accessibility features — like different touch control schemes and an auto-battle system, the UI design and experience on the other hand is atrocious and feels like a flash-game made in the early 2000s. It is even more exacerbated when playing the mobile version with big buttons and controls taking up a huge chunk of screen real estate. Luckily, it also works with physical controllers so you may also go that route if you want. (Tested with a Razer Kishi controller)\r\nGameplay is simplistic and I don’t have any complaints with it. It’s easy enough to find myself focusing more on the amazing storytelling. Don’t get me wrong, it's a cliche story of a group of heroes trying to save a changing world caught in a good vs evil battle. But there is a reason that cliche is used over and over again — it’s interesting — especially when done right.\r\nThe English localization is a bit rough, but it does the job in getting the point across. For example, the jokes are still funny, and the tutorials are still understandable enough to be of help to the player. You can also see a transcript of the current dialogue in place so it's a nice feature to be able to go back to some things you might have missed, especially if you have accidentally touched the screen.\r\nIf you’re looking for an affordable Retro JRPG experience with an intriguing story to play on your mobile phones and pass the time, and won’t mind a somewhat substandard UI experience, then look no further than Asdivine Saga.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "You have exactly 28 days left to reach the bunker before they bomb the city. You have your trusty car, and a new cat for a companion. You need to stop for gas once a day, and has 4 bullets remaining. Can you survive all 28 days in 1 Bit Survivor?\r\n1 Bit Survivor is a straightforward rogue-lite survival horror in portrait view. The presentation and the atmosphere is definitely classic Resident Evil 2 and 3-style, an obvious inspiration especially with sound bits when starting a session and the menacing sound effects that you hear. On the contrary, the gameplay is far from it with its subtle 1-bit retro game design and stylized monochromatic graphics.\r\n1 Bit Survivor kind of plays like a rogue-like where you need to survive the 28 days, or die trying and have to restart from day 1 again. Start off in a random level biome: sewers, hospitals, graveyards, etc. They are just visual flavor and do not really make a difference with enemies or item spawns. Every 7 days the biomed changes and the game gets slightly harder.\r\nThe controls are a bit hard at first, it feels like everything is in a rush with its small cramped levels, thankfully you can tweak the settings and the position of the gun fire button to your liking. I find it better when it is in the center of the D-Pad for movement, and it controls like the old Resident Evil games for some reason.\r\nEven though the game has ultra simplistic mechanics, the tactical aspect caught my attention. The game doesn't explicitly tell you this, but 1 Bit Survivor is sort of turn-based where the game only continues when you are performing an action. If you don’t move, everything else won’t either. So there’s no point in rushing. Once you get the hang of it, the game will be much easier.\r\nAside from using your pistol with limited ammo, you can also melee the infected, but you risk getting damaged and your health depleted. Different enemies have different durabilities, some will go down in 1 hit, some multiple gunshots or melee attacks. This makes some encounters pretty intense because not everything dies instantly.\r\nSome choices require you to forego an ammo or health pickup so you can escape and not risk death if there are still enemies present, or to carefully balance your supplies; maybe deplete your ammo first before going on an ammo pickup, or in order to save ammo, you can try and exchange melee hits with an enemy first before taking that health pickup.\r\n1 Bit Survivor has very simplistic graphics and mechanics, but it is still effective in portraying a proper survival horror experience with its tactical decision making elements and rogue-like progression system. Very simple to play, but hard to master.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4430351) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "You play as Jonathan Reeves, an amnesiac waking up from cryosleep, on a space transporter ship called Frontier-16. He doesn’t remember anything, but somehow he already has a shotgun locked and loaded… Not too long after, zombies come for him – The ship is infected.\r\nI’ve encountered not only mindless shamblers, but there are also weapon wielding zombies it seems. Some have guns of their own, shields, even missile launchers that you all have to avoid in order to survive. Thankfully most of the dangers I’ve encountered so far are projectile-based giving you a chance to react. Still enough to give you a hell of a challenge especially in narrow hallways and rooms.\r\nThe combat is a single-stick shooter style, you just use one stick for movement, one for shooting/interaction and most of the targeting is done automatically. I’m saying this as a positive — it is honestly a “brain dead” game where you don’t have to really pay attention to play it. There are different weapons that you can pick up like machine guns and laser guns, and they can break after a while except the shotgun as your basic weapon.\r\nThe levels are mostly linear and dungeon crawler-esque, clearing room to room, hallway to hallway. With very minor back and forth-ing puzzle element involving finding out which numbered door a specific terminal opens. Luckily you don’t have to remember these numbers thanks to the very helpful mini-map system to guide you in navigation.\r\nThe story is engaging and interesting, especially the premise, but it doesn’t interfere with the gameplay too much and mostly serves as background flavor to advance the gameplay from level to level. Overall, The combat is fun as a mindless arcade shooter to pass the time all while still providing a serviceable narrative experience on the side as a bonus.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "You are imprisoned at the bottom of a tower and have escaped. Your fellow animals are out to stop you from going up and escaping. As luck would have it, you can do three simple moves; Punch Kick Duck, and that’s the title of the game. That’s all you need really, to stop them from stopping you in this fun and lovely rhythmic beat ‘em up made specifically for mobile phones.\r\nYou can play Punch Kick Duck in either landscape or portrait mode, with controller support as well. Whatever works best for you. The game itself is easy to learn; just three types of attack. But it’s hard to master, because each enemy has their own attack-type that you need to counter in a rock-paper-scissors format. Punch beats Kick, Kick beats Duck, and Duck beats Punch. No need to move, as the game auto-moves your character.\r\nFor example, all bunnies use a kick attack, so you have to punch them in order to knock them out. Using kicks will just negate both of your attacks, while using duck will cause you to get hit. It gets confusing at first but given practice, it becomes just second nature and you will instinctively choose the right move for the right enemy.\r\nThe combat flow is oddly rhythmic and hitting combos gives off a satisfying feeling that will surely keep you playing for more levels, although it gets a bit hard starting at the third level, especially when you are swarmed with different types of enemies and you have to react in a timely manner in order to beat them.\r\nIn the later levels, some enemy types will have multiple types of attacks depending on their stances, so you have to pay extra attention so you can use the appropriate move to beat them. Some will also throw objects at you like bottles and food carts.\r\nYou only have one free revive, after that, it's game over when you get damaged again. Fortunately you can replenish this free revive by just continuing to beat down enemies, Giving you an extra life again. Game over means the level will just get restarted.\r\nThe 2.5D visuals are lovely and the upbeat music perfectly fits the gameplay, to the point that it almost plays like a rhythm game. My thoughts so far? Punch Kick Duck is a simple but a fun challenging game, and it’s free-to-play too, just with minor ads and optional microtransactions.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4438447) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "At first glance, youngsters might think of this game as Minecraft inspired with its blocky looking graphics. For the more aged gamer, It looks like The Elder Scrolls I or II.

    "body": "At first glance, youngsters might think of this game as Minecraft inspired with its blocky looking graphics. For the more aged gamer, It looks like The Elder Scrolls I or II. And they’re both right, as Margonem Adventures looks as if The Elder Scrolls II got upgraded to Minecraft graphics.\r\nAfter the tutorial section though, the game immediately shows its true colors as a mobile game, complete with a three star system to rate the “run”, an energy system to limit play, gacha elements, and daily, weekly, challenges as part of a live service setup. This allows you to get better items and loot in order to progress faster. The UI of the gameplay is passable at best, but the hub town is a major offender with its craggy UI and visuals.\r\nWhat’s most important though is the gameplay, as Margonem Adventures is a first-person RPG dungeon crawler that puts you in the shoes of a traveler, who's the only one that can purge the world of evil; one dungeon after another. Like the King-style Saga games (Candy Crush, Papa Pear Saga, etc), you also spend energy to get a try at these levels. Finishing dungeons grants you gold and random loot at the end, to equip on your character.\r\nThe controls are pretty non-complex; left side of the screen to move, and right side to look. Oftentimes, you will encounter monsters in the dungeon to fight, usually in big open spaces. The combat mostly consists of strafing left to right to avoid projectiles, moving backwards to avoid melee attacks, while throwing a plethora of spells — heal, freeze, poison, haste, defense, burn, etc. — chosen from a deck-like randomization element, two at a time. Some enemies will have special telegraph attacks but they’re still too easy for the first few levels that I’ve played.\r\nAlthough there is an option to disable it, I prefer using the auto-targeting feature in combat, as I feel it goes perfectly with the auto-attack nature of the game (there is no attack button). A nice quality life element especially when playing this game on the go and in short bursts where you don’t want to micromanage everything.\r\nThere’s also a small mini-exploration and puzzle angle wherein you have to collect all the crystals hidden in the levels, and interact with basic interactables like levers to open gates and or journals from dead adventurers. How many crystals you find will constitute your 1-3 star rating at the end of the dungeon run.\r\nMargonem Adventures is an interesting amalgamation of old-school first person RPGs, minecraft visuals, and candy crush-like progression system. It's a decent time-killer to play in short bursts, and it's just fitting since you can’t play long sessions anyway unless you pay.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a 3D platformer game that is based on the Nickelodeon animated series SpongeBob SquarePants. It is the spiritual successor to 2020’s Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated, which is in itself a remake of the original 2003 Battle for Bikini Bottom.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Beautiful and Amazing level design\r\n- Fun and engaging platforming aspects\r\n- Feels like a special episode from the animated series\r\n- The original voice actors, many of the soundtrack and soundbits are back## Cons\r\n-Felt like a downgrade from Battle for Bikini Bottom\r\n-Fetch quests can get repetitive\r\n-No multiplayer game modes\r\nWelcome back to Bikini Bottom, or 8 different versions of it.\r\nIn SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, You control the titular character SpongeBob, in his quest to restore his town of Bikini Bottom to normality, after a magic wishing mishap that caused his universe to collide with other alternate universes.\r\nThese universes are called wishworlds and contain an alternative version of Bikini Bottom, with many alternate versions of its inhabitants, like a Wild West Sheriff Sandy, or a movie director Squidward. Universes that SpongeBob must travel to and visit.\r\nThe premise is understandably a bit too high stakes than the usual stories in the animated series, and just timely considering the current craze about multiversal stories. It's a decent mover for both the story and the gameplay, although the premise gets old after a while, once you’ve visited multiple worlds already, even if they’re varied enough.\r\nA remnant of the glory platforming days of the PS1 and PS2 eras\r\nSpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake’s gameplay is a typical 3D platformer, which is extremely similar to games like Crash Bandicoot or Spyro the Dragon. Jumping across platforms, avoiding obstacles, using movement maneuvers like double jump, gliding, or dashes to navigate, and occasionally smashing boxes to get Jelly: the main collectible/currency, similar to coins or fruits in other games.\r\nIn between the core platforming, there are some mini games to enliven up the gameplay, like seahorse riding segments, similar to Crash Bandicoot 3’s level 'Orient Express’ where you ride an animal and must avoid and/or smash obstacles, and collect Jellies on the way.\r\nFetch Quests… Why??\r\nHow the story connects to the gameplay relies heavily on utilizing fetch quests after fetch quests, sometimes even piling on top of each other. And It can get pretty annoying after a while. For example, you need to find information and need help from a character, then that character will need an item in exchange. You go and find the item and another character is blocking it, requiring you to do another fetch quest. Lo and behold, to complete this fetch quest, it will require you to complete another side mission for a whole other character.\r\nThe level design is amazing nonetheless, the world is beautifully rendered and the platforming aspects are fun and engaging. It’s mostly linear but with some minor nooks and crannies that you can take to find more Jellies and smashable boxes which are simply addicting to do. There are some inconsistencies though with the smashable stacks of boxes; most will fall after smashing the bottom, but some will not and float in the air, which is annoying.\r\nThere are semblances of puzzle solving mechanics but the game never fully commits to it, resulting in a relatively easy level progression. Which honestly, isn’t a bad thing as the flow is continuous and the energetic momentum is easily maintained throughout levels. To top off the end of each level, There are easy and fun boss fights.\r\nMissed Opportunities\r\nCompared to the previous game, you can only control SpongeBob now, but there are more moves to unlock and use throughout the game. It is now strictly singleplayer, without any side modes with co-op capabilities. An unfortunate decision, as I think a co-op campaign is one of the many improvements the developers could have added. Imagine the LEGO games, or the PS2 classic Shrek 2.\r\nSpongeBob can fight!\r\nThe controls are highly responsive for the most part, and I never really had any difficulties in controlling SpongeBob. My only gripe is some bindings are a bit off for me, especially with how the Dodge/Dash is bound on the same button as the Jump-Slam attack. It messes with years of muscle memory of using a Jump-Dash combo, which can lead you to death many times because you instinctively tried to dash forward while in the air, only instead you dive down to your death.\r\nDeath is forgiving as well, the game gives you multiple lives to use before completely restarting from a checkpoint. Lives are spent if you fall down while platforming, or get damaged by enemies in combat. You can also find health pickups scattered around the map to replenish your lives.\r\nThe combat on the other hand is simplistic, you just mostly use a basic spinning main attack like Crash Bandicoot to one shot most enemies, but is modernized and made more engaging by just this one simple addition, a dodge mechanic. You also have other movement abilities that can be used for combat, like Jump-Slams or Bubble Blows. Sometimes when you enter combat, the game cages you along with the enemies in a sort of arena-style battle instance, requiring you to defeat the enemies before proceeding.\r\nFrom 2D to 3D\r\nGraphics wise, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is pristine looking and the lighting is amazing. It could easily pass as a Live Action or CGI quality animation and while it doesn’t look exactly like the 2D animated series, they’ve done the transition from 2D to 3D justice. The game also features many returning soundtrack and sound bits from the animated series, including the original voice actors. As a bonus, all the different worlds also have their own distinct themed soundtracks.\r\nWhen I am playing SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, the feeling is still there, like I am watching the good ol’ cartoons. The voice actors are the same, the sound bits are the same, the jokes are still on point, and the overall atmosphere is still SpongeBob SquarePants. It genuinely felt like I was watching one of the episodes. It doesn’t hold a candle to the previous game, Battle for Bikini Bottom, but it’s so far a decent follow-up nonetheless.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4447465) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "One of the most hyped games in recent years is a few days away! Hogwarts Legacy is a single player open-world action RPG set in the Harry Potter world. It takes place long before the events of the actual books / movies in a sort of a prequel setup, like the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic games.\r\nIt will be released on PC and current gen systems on February 10, with previous gen systems and Nintendo Switch to follow in the next few months.\r\nFirst off, we are in a bit of a different situation here than Harry and most wizards. Our custom character is a late bloomer who recently got accepted as a 5th year student for Hogwarts, and is under an accelerated learning program.\r\nIt’s a bit disappointing that we aren’t entering Hogwarts as a child in our first year, but gameplay wise it's a commendable design decision so we wouldn’t need to start from zero magic knowledge and allows for a more mature character, one that also matches with the story set in the game.\r\nNevertheless, our character still experiences Hogwarts for the first time, and that magical experience is still retained despite being somewhat remixed. Even though our character is a late bloomer, he is a gifted one with great potential and holds an ancient secret it seems.\r\nYour character is highly customizable, the voice, the face, the hair, even scars and of course, it would be a big disrespect to Harry Potter, if glasses are not available for you to wear. Immediately you will notice that the graphics look great. It looks very next-gen, even other characters like Professor Fig have immensely detailed faces, and wait till you see the environments and Hogwarts itself.\r\nAfter the brief introduction, Hogwarts Legacy starts off on a high note, with a surprising action-packed set piece that is even better than Harry Potter’s intro I would say. There is a bit of linear dungeon crawling to serve as a bit of a tutorial and plot exposition — including another action-packed set piece — but after that, you’re into Hogwarts!\r\nDuring the Sorting Ceremony, you can either let the game choose for you by asking you questions, or override that part and get to choose one of the four houses. While that alone doesn’t really affect the overall narrative of the game, It’s a nice flavor to have and gives you a bit of variety when it comes to different common rooms, attire colors, NPCs, and companions.\r\nSo far, the world I’ve seen is expansive and big, even just exploring Hogwarts castle itself is immense already and feels really immersive with all the quests, activities, and places that you can do and explore.\r\nThe combat is downright amazing. It’s just your typical ranged combat in a hack and slash game; spam the attack button, dodge, counter, and use different skills, but as far as Harry Potter combat goes, they’ve completely nailed it and even made it more visually appealing, with different stylish poses every attack you make.\r\nIt’s flashy and kinetic, even more so than what we've seen in the movies. They actually made wand combat interesting considering they’re just waving around small sticks in the air, for all intents and purposes. They have no business being as cool and stylish as they are in the game.\r\nThey did not skimp on the details and really went all in and utilized all the existing lore to its potential. Nothing is overlooked, many elements from the books / movies are used and are even expanded upon. It’s like they made an interactive Hogwarts Museum first and built a game and story on top of that.\r\nEven though you can explore the castle and the rest of the outside premises almost immediately, Hogwarts Legacy did a pretty good job on the initial introduction, questing, and progression to be able to provide a decent avenue for the story and its open-world nature to coalesce into one cohesive singular experience. So far, Hogwarts Legacy is set to be a masterpiece and it's probably THE Harry Potter game we’ve always dreamed of!\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Asdivine Saga is another Retro-JRPG in the likes of classic Final Fantasy games like FFV and FFVI, The latest standalone entry in the somewhat popular and at the same time obscure retro-style JRPG series Asdivine.\r\nThese games are made primarily for and popular on mobile platforms. Most of the games were also released on PC and consoles but turned out not quite as popular.\r\n## Pros\r\n- The story and premise is quite intriguing\r\n- The characters are likable and charming\r\n- Gameplay is fun enough to keep you interested\r\n- Different control options: touch, virtual gamepad, and physical gamepad.## Cons\r\n-The UI design and experience is mediocre\r\n-English localization is a bit rough\r\nA simple mercenary caught in the middle of the conflict.\r\nAsdivine Saga starts off with the typical upbeat introduction of the main character, Vyse, an already established hot-headed fighter / mercenary by the time the game starts. It wastes no time immersing us in the story and the stakes involved. You see, Vyse lives in Nondia, a neutral territory far from the warring kingdoms of Lightoria and Zandark (“light” and “dark”, I see what you did there). Both kingdoms are trying to recruit Nondians to their cause, and Vyse is caught in the middle of the conflict.\r\nCute female characters\r\nAlong with Vyse you will run into three cute female characters to form your party, in a bit of a fanservice approach to the game. Celes, a princess of Lightoria, and Nisha, a princess of Zandark, plus a cute Ninja girl named Akane.\r\nThe character designs in the game are retro-chibi style in-game, but while in dialogues, there are portraits that are highly detailed and anime-looking. You can build relationships with your mostly female party members, but alas, for those who are expecting heavy romantic elements in the game, it's unfortunately not present.\r\nThere is a hidden power at play here with the two kingdoms, one that seems to be influencing both sides of the war, and it's up to our hero and his ragtag party of cute and interesting female heroes to investigate this and maybe, save the world from the horrors of full-scale global war.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay is retro-inspired and the setup best resembles Final Fantasy V and VI with its beautiful 2D art-style where you can roam around in the levels in traditional 2D exploration, and an overworld segment to travel across the continent. Soundtrack is decent and was treated like a proper retro-JRPG game, giving off either a melodramatic and cheerful mood, depending on the situation.\r\nIt also has an instanced turn-based combat system with attack, skill, magic, and item / throw options. Your party is on the right side, the enemies on the left.\r\nAsdivine Saga has a Combat tactics system where you can change tactics and ‘formation’; like increasing your defense in exchange for reduced damage, or prioritizing skills and magic attacks over basic attacks. It's a simple addition but one that adds another layer to the gameplay.\r\nWhile there are no strong combat elements to make this game highly memorable in the gameplay department, it still features some unique mechanics. Like experimenting with Akane to combine different items to throw resulting in different special attacks, or using fairy-like spirits to accompany heroes and boost their attacks. During the exploration parts, you can also swap characters to control them instead of the main character.\r\nThis game gives you a lot of options on how to play.\r\nTo help players, Asdivine Saga has a lot of modern accessibility features; there are different touch control schemes and you can choose to play in either pure point and click touch screen “Tap mode”, or with a virtual gamepad called “gamepad mode”. It also supports physical controllers like the Razer Kishi. There is also an auto-battle system for those who just want to focus on the story and not immerse themselves with the rather standard combat system.\r\nThe battle queueing system seen in other Asdivine games is also back and is a nice additional accessibility feature to help players track the current flow of combat, to find out which character or enemy is next to move.\r\nThe UI design and experience is atrocious and feels like a flash-game made in the early 2000s. It is even more exacerbated when playing the mobile version with big buttons and controls taking up a huge chunk of screen real estate.\r\nThere is quality, but there is also quantity:\r\nOverall, the gameplay of Asdivine Saga is simplistic and I don’t have any complaints with it. It’s fun enough to keep me interested all throughout the experience, and easy enough to find myself focusing more on the amazing storytelling. Don’t get me wrong, it's a cliche story of a group of heroes trying to save a changing world caught in a good vs evil battle. But there is a reason that cliche is used over and over again — it’s interesting — especially when done right.\r\nEndgame wise, there is no in-lore postgame exploration, but you can explore to the point before the final encounter, as typical with other games. You can also grind and level to your heart’s content, up to a ridiculous max level of 999. Although it will only take you around 20 hours only to finish the story, complete with multiple endings and amazing plot twists waiting to surprise you.\r\nThe English localization is a bit rough, but it does the job in getting the point across, for example, the jokes are still funny, and the tutorials are still understandable enough to be of help to the player. You can also see a transcript of the current dialogue in place so it's a nice feature to be able to go back to somethings you might have missed, especially if you have accidentally touched the screen.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4473665) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## Pros\r\n- A decent mindless shooter gameplay\r\n- Nice enemy variety, including zombies with guns.\r\n- This type of game needs no narrative, but it does have one anyway as a bonus\r\n- Controller Support## Cons\r\n-The combat encounters at times are annoying, even borderline imbalanced because of the cramped space.\r\nA nightmarish awakening\r\nYou play as Jonathan Reeves, an amnesiac waking up from cryosleep, on a space transporter ship called Frontier-16. He doesn’t remember anything, but somehow he already has a shotgun locked and loaded… Not too long after, zombies come for him – The ship is infected.\r\nJonathan Reeves is a man full of personality judging from his constant quips and monologuing, unfortunately the retro-pixel art style coupled with no voice acting leaves no room for expression aside from text bits that you can read and skip.\r\nThis aforementioned pixel art style is nicely looking though, with low resolution animations appeasing the retro gods and ominous sound bits complimenting the zombie survival tone. It somehow reminds me of Among Us, especially with the spaceship setting and survivalist premise.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe combat of Ailment: dead standoff is a single-stick shooter style, you just use one stick for movement, one for shooting/interaction and most of the targeting is done automatically. The controls are pretty responsive, but I find the character moves a bit too fast considering the small size of the hallways and corridors.\r\nYou can play Ailment: dead standoff in traditional touch controls, but you can also use supported physical controllers. I’ve tested it on Razer Kishi and it works out of the box.\r\nYou start off with a shotgun as your base weapon, and then, collect other weapons as “power-ups” that run out of ammo, or break down in time after prolonged use. I found it weird that a shotgun is the base weapon compared to the usual pistol or melee attack, maybe that’s their standard issue in these times?\r\nHealth, weapons, and upgrade pick-ups are scattered on the map, mostly inside lockers as a substitute for loot chests. There are different weapons that you can pick up like machine guns and laser guns. Not only you but your fellow crewmates can somehow still use weapons, even those that are infected.\r\nYes, zombies are using guns.\r\nSome of these infected people are wielding guns of their own, shields, even missile launchers that you all have to avoid in order to survive. It gives off a nice enemy variety that mirrors the player’s arsenal and abilities, and not to overly rely on melee attacks as the go-to health depleter. From time to time, you will also encounter non-zombified NPCs that can follow you around, and die.\r\nThankfully aside from the zombie melee attacks, all ranged attacks are projectile-based and are avoidable to an extent. There is a bullet-hell element to Ailment: dead standoff, but it doesn’t exactly line up well with the top down corridor shooter gameplay; it becomes a hell of a challenge especially in narrow hallways and cramped rooms, to the point that many of the encounters are annoying, even borderline imbalanced.\r\nThere’s not much room available to evade these bullet-hell projectiles, as a result, any tactical or skill-based approach that would otherwise be viable has been eliminated, it just becomes a game of frantically running around hoping you won’t get hit. Ergo, Ailment: dead standoff is at its best when the enemies are melee or the encounters are on a spacious area.\r\nThe story is engaging and interesting, but it doesn’t interfere with the gameplay too much and mostly serves as background flavor to advance the gameplay from level to level.\r\nIs this a spaceship or a maze?\r\nThe levels are mostly linear and dungeon crawler-esque, clearing room to room, hallway to hallway with very minor back and forth-ing puzzle element involving finding out which numbered door a specific terminal opens, luckily you don’t have to remember these numbers thanks to a very helpful mini-map system to guide you in navigation. The game only saves at the beginning of each level, so death usually means a level restart — no checkpoints.\r\nOverall, Ailment: dead standoff is decent as a mindless arcade shooter to pass the time all while still providing a serviceable background level narrative experience on the side as a bonus. Just don’t expect deep combat mechanics and an immersive storytelling experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4480060) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This usually leads to popular common denominators, such as retro art-style, and rogue-like gameplay, and Dungreed is one such example. The only difference now lies in the gameplay, does Dungreed have what it takes to get your attention?\r\n## Pros\r\n- High quality pixel-art\r\n- Wide variety of weapons, including PLASMA RIFLES\r\n- Quality fast travel system\r\n- Controller Support## Cons\r\n-Starts off slow\r\n-The town management aspect felt half-baked\r\nIt has the gameplay of Rogue Legacy and the charm of Terraria\r\nDungreed is a 2D rogue-lite side-scrolling dungeon crawler with pixel-art graphics. Enter the dungeon, explore room after room, battle enemies, gather loot, and die. Now repeat that again, but with slightly better skills, gold, and more experience. It’s a rogue-lite game because there is some persistence going on. The gameplay loop reminds me of the popular rogue-like game Rogue Legacy, while its charming nature also reminds me of Terraria’s art-style and combat.\r\nA peaceful town is suddenly disturbed by a magic dungeon. Its mouth / entrance appearing out of nowhere and sucking almost everything from the town; villagers and entire houses. You are an unnamed adventurer, sent to investigate this town two weeks later. You meet a lone villager, who helps you and briefs you with what happened. Your main quest is to investigate the dungeon, find other villages, and maybe repair and restore the town.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nYou can immediately go dungeon crawling right from the get go, and die immediately as well. Each level layout is randomly generated with varying biomes such as caves, prison, jungle, volcanoes, including the rooms which are closed until you clear it of enemies. This means you cannot escape combat encounters and move to the next room.\r\nLevels always culminate in a boss fight at the end, wherein you need to beat it before you can move to the next level. A pretty standard experience so far.\r\nAside from hostile levels, sometimes you will also run into shopkeepers as well such as an Innkeeper or a weapons dealer, a welcome reprieve from battling monsters.\r\nThe Innkeeper offers food, which, unconventionally, doesn’t do healing, instead it is turned into a stat bonus modifier. You need to select your meal to eat, each with their own bonuses to give to you. Taking up meals reduces your hunger and prevents you from taking too many bonuses, however, going dungeon crawling and clearing rooms will inevitably make your character hungry again. It's a novel way of subverting our expectations and provides a fresh way of playing rogue-lites.\r\nIs it a town management game?\r\nThe previously mentioned town repairing and villager finding quest adds another layer of gameplay to Dungreed, you can immediately affect the town even in the early stages and see it gradually going back to normal.\r\nThere are minor bonuses in doing so like getting randomized gear from the villagers, or increasing the roster of weapons to be found on the dungeons. This is different to other rogue-likes where the only thing to do is to go on a dungeon crawling marathon, hoping to finally clear the game playthrough after playthrough.\r\nUltimately, the town management aspect felt half-baked still and could have been more expanded upon with more stuff to repair, build, and manage. They already got the Terarria vibes right, so it's half-way there. Perhaps in a sequel?\r\nLiteral otherworldly weapons\r\nThere are two weapon slots, usually assigned for a melee and a ranged weapon, and 4 accessories to equip. You will also encounter loot choices from time to time. Select a powerful weapon or item out of a random selection, to keep with you throughout the run.\r\nWhat’s ridiculous though, is that aside from cool and powerful medieval weapons like magic scythes, the game abandons sanity as it also features guns. Yes, guns like plasma rifles and sniper rifles are present in the game.\r\nEvery run, the dungeon kicks you back out to the town and sucks all your items and gear so you will have to start from scratch.\r\nA quality fast travel system\r\nAs for the traversal system, there are no checkpoints, but the game understands the players needs and provides us with a very generous fast travel system. You can fast travel between shops, and every single room in every level, completely eliminating the need for back and forth-ing, especially when reaching dead ends.\r\nThe controls, while it takes a while to get used to, are enjoyable and lively. The combat and the movements are cool and flashy, especially when you are dashing around enemies and while doing some platforming elements. You can play in touch control mode, or you can also use a physical controller. I’ve tested it with a Razer Kishi and it works out of the box.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4492574) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Margonem Adventures is a first person RPG and 3D dungeon crawler with Minecraft looking graphics, packed in traditional mobile game format, for better or for worse.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Interesting deck building style of combat\r\n- A decent time-killer to play in short bursts## Cons\r\n-Energy system to limit play\r\n-Heavy gacha / live service elements\r\n-Uninspired combat system\r\nThere was an original Margonem game for PC which was a 2D MMORPG, and this game was apparently supposed to be Margonem 2. But something happened during development that converted this game into a mobile game now titled Margonem Adventures.\r\nIs this Minecraft RPG or Elder Scrolls II?\r\nAt first glance, youngsters might think of this game as Minecraft inspired with its blocky looking graphics. For the more aged gamer, It looks like The Elder Scrolls I or II. And they’re both right, as Margonem Adventures looks as if The Elder Scrolls II got upgraded to Minecraft graphics.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nMargonem Adventures features a first-person ranged magic combat, built on a dungeon crawler setup, populated with classic looking 2D pixelated enemy sprites that are almost always facing you like a tidal-locked moon. The game starts off pretty interesting and it definitely had a promising gameplay.\r\nAfter the tutorial section though, the game immediately shows its true colors as a mobile game, complete with a three star system to rate the “run”, an energy system to limit play, gacha elements, and daily, weekly, challenges as part of a live service setup. This allows you to spend real money to get better items and loot in order to progress faster.\r\nGacha gaming\r\nThere is a shop, but most of the things offered are mainly in-game purchases using real money, in fact the in-game gold coins you collect isn’t even a useful currency, only used in upgrades, like a crafting material.\r\nThe UI of the gameplay is passable at best, but the hub town is a major offender with its craggy UI and visuals. Thank goodness as we don’t have to spend a lot of time in the hub town. As most of the gameplay is centered in dungeon crawling and the occasional menu hopping to equip items and skills.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nWhat’s most important though is the gameplay, as Margonem Adventures is a first-person RPG dungeon crawler that puts you in the shoes of a traveler, who's the only one that can purge the world of evil; one dungeon after another. Like the King-style Saga games (Candy Crush, Papa Pear Saga, etc), you also spend energy to get a try at these levels. Finishing dungeons grants you gold and random loot at the end, to equip on your character.\r\nAs of writing, I’ve counted the available levels for you to play and it's at 41 levels, divided into four chapters. This chapterized division felt totally pointless, as there are no bosses at the end of these chapters, no cutscenes or story elements.\r\nThere’s also a small mini-exploration and puzzle angle wherein you have to collect all the crystals hidden in the levels, and interact with basic interactables like levers to open gates and or journals from dead adventurers. How many crystals you find will constitute your 1-3 star rating at the end of the dungeon run.\r\nThe controls are pretty non-complex; left side of the screen to move, and right side to look. Oftentimes, you will encounter monsters in the dungeon to fight, usually in big open spaces.\r\nThe uninspired combat mostly consists of strafing left to right to avoid projectiles, moving backwards to avoid melee attacks, while throwing a plethora of spells — heal, freeze, poison, haste, defense, burn, etc. — chosen from a deck-like randomization element, two at a time. Some enemies will have special telegraphed attacks but they’re still too easy to predict and evade.\r\nThe highlight of the game\r\nThe deck-building system is the most compelling part of the game, you can select up to a max 10 cards, and you can unlock more cards for use by collecting shards in order to craft them, as well as upgrade them using a specific material. As mentioned earlier, during combat, two of these cards from your deck of 10 are randomly selected, and you can choose which one to use. Then after your attack timer cools down, it picks two random cards again, rinse, repeat.\r\nAlthough there is an option to disable it, I prefer using the auto-targeting feature in combat, as I feel it goes perfectly with the auto-attack nature of the game (there is no attack button). A nice quality life element especially when playing this game on the go and in short bursts where you don’t want to micromanage everything and spam tapping the screen.\r\nItem customization is a generic Action-RPG setup: You can equip different headgears, body gears, foot wears, a single weapon and two jewelries. You can find upgrades via dungeon rewards or opening chests, by spending gems or real money. I find nothing about the itemization interesting and it mostly boils down to equipping whichever item has the higher number.\r\nArena mode!\r\nIf you are tired of the dungeon crawling and just want to focus on the combat, you can also participate in the “Endless Arena” to play in a survival game mode where enemies perpetually attack you in waves. I personally find this game mode more fun than the actual dungeons.\r\nUltimately, its mixed bag experience for me, as its underdeveloped UI, gacha nature, and play limiting energy system drags down the otherwise interesting on-the-go dungeon crawler. Which is a shame because I really liked the idea of a first person dungeon crawler game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4492617) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The atmosphere is definitely classic Resident Evil 2 and 3-style, an obvious inspiration especially with sound bits when starting a session complete with typewriter sounds to tell the story, and the menacing sound effects that you hear. The comparison however ends there as the gameplay features a 1-bit retro game design and monochromatic graphics.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Simple gameplay but will engage your mind\r\n- Charming stylized 1-bit visual presentation\r\n- A decent survival horror experience considering the limited 1-bit gameplay\r\n- Play in vertical or landscape format## Cons\r\n-Not much to do after beating it, other than replay it again.\r\nThe world is lost, an unstoppable virus wiped out humanity, turning most living things into mutants. In 28 days they will use a bomb to wipe out the world. You have no reason to live anymore, but meeting Leo — a stray cat — gave you a new lease on life. There is a bunker, and you have exactly 28 days left to reach it. You have your trusty car, you need to stop for gas once a day, and have a pistol with 4 bullets remaining.\r\nPlayable in both vertical and landscape format, 1 Bit Survivor is a rogue-like game at its core where you need to survive the 28 days, or die trying and have to restart from day 1 again. Start off in a randomly generated level biome: village, sewers, hospitals, graveyards, etc. They are just visual flavor and do not really make a difference with enemies or item spawns. Every 7 days the biomed changes and the game gets slightly harder. There are nine different enemy types ranging from the simple zombies, to infected animals like bats and spiders.\r\nLevels are rectangular and are littered with the infected plus 3 types of random loot. The gas, which always spawns; a random ammo pick up to replenish the 4 bullets; and a health pick up. The gas is the only thing important in order to proceed to the next level, you can ignore the rest if the situation calls for it. You can’t see everything in the level, because of the cute little fog of war system they have in place.\r\nThe controls are a bit hard at first, it feels like everything is in a rush with its small cramped levels. Thankfully you can tweak the settings and the position of the gun fire button to your liking. I find it better when it is in the center of the D-Pad for movement, and it feels like the old tank controls from the Resident Evil games.\r\nWhile the actual gameplay only features small, vague 1-bit character sprites, it is elevated by the highly detailed — still 1-bit — animations overlaying on the screen when doing actions like shooting, reloading, healing, etc. A nice touch that adds a lot of noir-like personality to the game that I could never get tired of seeing. Something about these animations reminds me of the 80s and 90s era for some reason.\r\nEven though the game has ultra simplistic mechanics, the compelling tactical aspect caught my attention. The game doesn't explicitly tell you this, but 1 Bit Survivor is not real-time, and sort of turn-based where the game only continues when you are performing an action. If you don’t move, everything else won’t either. So there’s no point in rushing. Once you get the hang of it, the game will be much easier.\r\nNot that easy though, as even though you already know everything about the game, 1 Bit Survivor is still a challenging game to beat. Easy to learn but hard to master. Sessions usually last a few minutes tops, especially if you die early — Perfect for short bursts and on-the-go gaming. Although once you get a flow going and have started to make a run into actually completing all 28 days, it can eat up your time. Luckily, you can save your progress and continue the run for another time, when needed.\r\nAside from using your pistol with limited ammo, you can also melee the infected, but you risk getting damaged and your health depleted. Different enemies have different durabilities, some will go down in 1 hit, some multiple gunshots or melee attacks. This makes some encounters pretty intense because not everything dies instantly.\r\nAs you keep playing, you will unlock two more objectively better character types than the starting one, with their own starting weapon, health, and ammo providing a slight variation to the gameplay.\r\n1 Bit Survivor allows for some interesting resource management elements, some choices in the game will require you to forego an ammo or health pickup so you can escape and not risk death if there are still enemies present, or to carefully balance your supplies; maybe deplete your ammo first before going on an ammo pickup, or in order to save ammo, you can try and exchange melee hits with an enemy first before taking that health pickup.\r\nAfter you die trying, or have somehow survived; you are given a summary of your run: playtime, kills, days survived, shots survive, etc. After that, you can start a playthrough again, nothing more, nothing less.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4492522) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Punch Kick Duck is a mobile beat’ em up game with a simple no frills gameplay and a straightforward goal, to reach the top of the tower and escape.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fun and satisfying combat mechanics\r\n- Challenging variety of enemies\r\n- Controller support\r\n- Play in landscape or vertical## Cons\r\n-Too short\r\nYou are imprisoned at the bottom of a tower and have escaped. Your fellow animals are out to stop you from going up and escaping. As luck would have it, you can do three simple moves; Punch, Kick, and Duck. That’s all you need really, to stop them from stopping you.\r\nGameplay Analysis:\r\nPunch Kick Duck is playable in either landscape or portrait mode, with controller support as well, Whatever works best for you. The game itself is easy to learn; just three types of attack. But it’s hard to master, because each enemy has their own attack-type that you need to counter in a rock-paper-scissors format. Punch beats Kick, Kick beats Duck, and Duck beats Punch.\r\nFor example, all bunnies use a kick attack, so you have to punch them in order to knock them out. Using kicks will just negate both of your attacks, while using duck will cause you to get hit. It gets confusing at first but given practice, it becomes just second nature and you will instinctively choose the right move as soon as you see the enemy type.\r\nPunch Kick Duck will throw all sorts of enemy types at the same time, and they can come from both sides. It’s becomes highly skill-based game that will test your reaction time, reflexes, and memory. It features three difficulty levels. so if you are having difficulties you can just play at the easiest setting.\r\nThe combat flow is oddly rhythmic and hitting combos gives off a satisfying feeling that will surely keep you playing for more levels, although it gets a bit hard starting at the third level, especially when you are swarmed with different types of enemies and you have to react in a timely manner in order to beat them.\r\nIt's free to play, but with slight ads or microtransactions.\r\nOne free revive is all you got, after that, it's game over when you get damaged again. Fortunately you can replenish this free revive (if used already) by just continuing to beat down enemies, giving you an extra life again. Game over means the level will just get restarted.\r\nYou gain coins during runs, which you can also use to force buy a revive — if you don’t want to watch an ad.\r\nYou can also buy and unlock various anthropomorphic characters, so it's not just a Duck that’s available, we also have other fan favorite animals like a dog, a cat, and a chicken, among others. However, most of the characters are only unlockable via real money. Fortunately, this is a free to play game that is beatable without ever spending a dime, so the in-game purchases are just optional.\r\nSimple, but hard to master\r\nIn the later levels, some enemy types will have multiple types of attacks depending on their stances, so you have to pay extra attention so you can use the appropriate move to beat them. Some enemies will also take more than a single hit to knock out. Some will also throw objects at you like bottles and food carts.\r\nThere is a one minute timer before a bear comes out from behind to try and chase you down, requiring you to clear the levels in a hurry. If he catches up, it's an instant fail.\r\nEven though the game auto-moves, you can still hold the screen to run, and the game encourages you to clear the levels in a fast way. Running more often and leaving enemies behind will give you more points as you are scored at the end of each level, not to mention the chances of the bear catching you gets lower.\r\nPunch Kick Duck is a very short game, only spanning 10 visually distinct levels, with the final level being a boss fight. It’s beatable in under 30 minutes especially once you’ve mastered the combat system. Despite the short length, it’s still highly replayable especially if you find the combat very satisfying.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4492652) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It features a compelling original linear story that takes us to Hogwarts, as well as its surrounding vicinities; the Scottish Highlands and familiar places like Hogsmeade, The Forbidden Forest, and many more.\r\nIt will be released first on PC and current gen systems today, with previous gen systems and Nintendo Switch to the following months.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Captures that Harry Potter atmosphere perfectly\r\n- The world is immersive, big and expansive\r\n- Beautiful Graphics\r\n- Engaging combat, flashy and kinetic\r\n- An gripping story that is every bit as Harry Potter as you would expect## Cons\r\n- While immersive from a visual and narrative standpoint, the world feels static and unmoved by your actions as an RPG main character.\r\n- Outside cutscenes and scripted events, the characters may seem robotic and flat\r\n## The letter is finally here!\r\nFirst off, we are in a bit of a different situation here than Harry and most wizards. Our custom character is a late bloomer who recently got accepted as a 5th year student for Hogwarts, and is under an accelerated learning program.\r\nI find it disappointing that we aren’t entering Hogwarts as a child in our first year, but from a gameplay standpoint this is a good decision to make, as we are not required to start from scratch and go through the basics of learning all spells from basically nothing. After all, this game is built mostly for existing Harry Potter fans who already knows a lot about the lore.\r\nIt also allows for a more mature character that can make more mature decisions, one that also matches with the story set in the game. The time period takes place long before the events of the actual books / movies in a sort of a prequel setup, like the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic games.\r\n## The magic is still there\r\nNevertheless, our character still experiences Hogwarts for the first time, and that magical experience is still retained despite being somewhat remixed. Even though our character is a late bloomer, he is a gifted one with great potential and holds an ancient secret it seems.\r\nHe is sometimes referenced throughout the game as THE NEW fifth year, because joining Hogwarts at such a late age is a very rare if not a never before seen occurrence, giving him a sort of a mild celebrity status. Mirroring Harry Potter when he first came into Hogwarts.\r\n## No Harry, no problem\r\nYour character is highly customizable, the voice, the face, the hair, even scars and of course, it would be a big disrespect to Harry Potter, if glasses are not available for you to wear. You can select from two sets of voices with a customizable pitch, with four difficulty settings that mostly affect enemy damage and health. Worry not, as you can still adjust the difficulty on the fly if you happen to experience difficulty spikes on your playthrough.\r\nGender wise, there isn’t really an explicit choice between male and female. You can only select a male or female body type, voice, and a dormitory. Characters will also refer to you in third-person pronouns, it’s a pretty gender neutral approach to character creation.\r\n## Beautiful Graphics\r\nImmediately you will notice that the graphics look phenomenal. It looks next-gen, even other characters like Professor Fig have immensely detailed faces, it does not go for photorealistic looking humans but rather stylized looking whimsical characters that have a slight cartoonish charm to it.\r\nThe environments on the other hand are immersive looking and highly intricate, Hogwarts is faithfully recreated with all its nooks and crannies; vines emanating from castle walls, secret passageways, and grand staircases (albeit with a different take) . Even made better looking than the movie with all the added little details. The surrounding environments are enormous and wide-ranging, from a Victorian era village to a brooding dark cave, they all look damn good.\r\nThey really did a faithful adaptation of the Harry Potter world. It's like they made an interactive Hogwarts Museum first and built a game and story on top of that.\r\n## An action-packed intro\r\nAfter the brief introduction, Hogwarts Legacy starts off on a high note, with a surprising action-packed set piece that is even better than Harry Potter’s intro I would say. There is brief linear dungeon crawling to serve as a bit of a tutorial and plot exposition — including another action-packed set piece — but after that, you’re into Hogwarts!\r\nDuring the Sorting Ceremony, you can either let the game choose for you by asking you questions, or override that part and get to choose one of the four houses. Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While this house choice doesn’t really affect the overall narrative of the game, It’s a nice flavor to have and gives you some variety when it comes to different common rooms, attire colors, NPCs, and companions.\r\n## A diverse range of characters\r\nIn Hogwarts Legacy, there is a diverse roster of NPCs, even more diverse than what we’ve seen in the Harry Potter stories. Each with their own interesting personalities that feels in-line with the Wizarding World. There are new names to know, but also familiar names too: like Black and Weasley. You can get to know these characters and even build relationships with them, but as far as romance goes, it’s non-existent for this game.\r\nMost of the interactions you get from these characters are via quests and story elements, outside these cutscenes and scripted events, the characters will do a 180 and will become robotic and flat, which can break the immersive a little bit.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nEven just exploring Hogwarts castle itself feels magical already during the first few hours of the game and feels really immersive with all the quests, activities, and places that you can do and explore. Aside from the mainline story quests, there are also side quests, including some in-universe magic games like Summoner's Court, and Crossed Wands Dueling. Unfortunately, you cannot play Quidditch because of an in-universe explanation that I won't spoil.\r\nThe questing setup is simple: go to a place, solve this using a specific spell, maybe defeat some baddies on the way. It’s a tone that is steady throughout the game, but I never found it repetitive due to that constant barrage of new areas to explore, spells to use, and characters to meet.\r\nIn between the narrative-heavy segments, you can live as a normal student, by skipping or attending classes – preferably attending them to learn new spells. Classes are basically a part of the questing system, but brim filled with cutscenes and are understandably just glorified tutorial segments to learn new spells, Classes and Tutorials are synonymous words, after all.\r\n## A very entertaining amusement ride.\r\nThere are the occasional dialogue choices, but it doesn’t really amount to much when it comes to affecting the world, seeing a different reaction from NPCs, or showing some sort of consistent good or evil side from your character.\r\nSpeaking of good and evil, you cannot go full evil at this game. The best you can do is be rude and use Avada Kedavra (The Killing Curse) on deserving enemies (Not students and faculty members).\r\nHaving said that, while immersive from a visual and narrative standpoint, the world feels static and unmoved by your actions as an RPG player. It's like you are just in a heavily scripted amusement ride with minor choices to make and pretty restricted on what to do, but don’t get me wrong, it’s a very entertaining scripted amusement ride.\r\nFor those looking for a true Harry Potter sandbox experience, this is not it yet folks. Maybe with future sequels or even just PC mods, it can be possible.\r\nI don't remember Harry Potter combat being this cool\r\nFor the combat of Hogwarts Legacy, it’s downright amazing. It’s just your typical ranged combat in a hack and slash game: spam the attack button, dodge, counter, and use different skills, but as far as Harry Potter combat goes, they’ve completely nailed it and even made it more visually appealing, with different stylish poses every attack you make.\r\nThis is very reminiscent of the stylish mage combat animations from Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition, except it’s on a real-time combat system more-akin to Dark Souls with all the dodges and parries. I feel that this dodge mechanic is so overused nowadays, but I couldn't blame them for including it — It never gets old, at least for the past decade or so.\r\nThe combat flow in general is flashy and kinetic, even more so than what we've seen in the movies. They actually made wand combat interesting considering they’re just waving around small sticks in the air, for all intents and purposes. They have no business being as cool and stylish as they are in the game.\r\nThe RPG elements are light and surface level quality only. Aside from customizing your character's looks and obtaining random negligible loot to gear up your character's stats, most of the RPG gameplay centers on the skill tree or what the game calls Talents, where you can unlock spells and abilities like Stupefy, Avada Kedavra, and Potion making bonuses. There are no respecs and not all talents are obtainable in a single playthrough, so you’d have to be very careful in choosing which to unlock. Did they do this to encourage multiple playthroughs? possibly, but the lack of a New Game Plus game mode tells us otherwise.\r\n## A Harry Potter game - through and through\r\nThey did not skimp on the details and really went all in and utilized all the existing lore to its potential. Nothing is overlooked, many elements from the books / movies are used and are even expanded upon. There are lots of collectibles, mini-games, secrets, and easter eggs that Potterheads will encounter to the point that it becomes overwhelming and maybe too on the nose.\r\nEven though you can explore the castle and the rest of the outside premises almost immediately, Hogwarts Legacy did a pretty good job on the introduction, questing, and overall progression to be able to provide a decent avenue for the story and its open-world nature to coalesce into one cohesive singular experience that will last for 30 hours or more. Sure, it’s not a true open-world sandbox, but the game never pretended it was one.\r\n## Technical Performance\r\nAs of writing, it did not run 100% smooth on my setup with an i7-8700k, RTX 3080, and 32GB RAM with random hiccups and stutters, especially when entering new areas and interiors. Hopefully they can patch it up during release week. It also has a ‘Verified’ status with the Steam Deck and it plays nicely with it, as long as you are fine with a locked 30fps performance.\r\n## Cursor navigation again?\r\nA minor gripe, but the infamous cursor menu navigation seen in other games is present in this game. No D-Pad controls, no snappy navigation, so you have to painstakingly drag the cursor using the analog sticks to select menu elements, as if you're using a mouse cursor. It works for PC players, but not for controller users, so just why?\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nHogwarts Legacy faithfully captures the atmosphere of the Wizarding World, and creates a fantastic Hogwarts experience with a gripping story in-line with the lore and gives us a world full of wonder and magic. The RPG elements might be a little too light and the world is not as sandboxy as one might expect, but overall, it is a masterpiece that lives up to the hype and THE quintessential Harry Potter game we’ve always dreamed of. It is surely an early contender for GOTY for me.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4492467) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "You play as Lieutenant Hannah Stone, a hardboiled Hong Kong cop, leader of the police squad named Zombie Unit. Your mission is to uncover a corporate conspiracy in a cyberpunk world full of cybernetic mercenaries, gangs, and private militaries.\r\nThe game starts us off with a short  --- mostly boring --- plot exposition of sorts by way of spliced and remixed TV news reports to showcase the world's history leading up to our setting, then straightaway switching to the main group of characters doing their normal thing.  After that, we jump straight to the gameplay with a quick and informative tutorial to get you up to speed.\r\nThe story is unfortunately nothing special, just a generic cyberpunk setup that really doesn’t captivate you or keep you invested — Mainly a poor excuse to continue killing baddies. Thankfully, it immediately, and always gives way to the gameplay which is the main focus. Cutscenes are few and far between and the story is forgettable and ignorable. This game is best played to have fun killing enemies, not to experience a gripping story.\r\nSo far, the gameplay is more interesting than the story. At its core, it is a third person cover shooter but with a very agile character who can do athletic maneuvers, one that can easily close the distance with enemies and allow you to blend in some hack and slash combat action. You have three other teammates beside you fighting, but they’re mostly background flavor without any interaction or command system and do not really impact the gameplay in a meaningful way.\r\nAs a third person cover shooter, Wanted: Dead is lame and uninspired — guns have almost no punch to them and sound like toys. However, combined with the hack and slash element, the gameplay gets to work.\r\nDespite being janky and clunky, you can do pretty amazing combos with the melee combat, as well as allowing players to seamlessly switch between swordplay and gunplay to take down enemies in a variety of ways, as Lt. Stone moves fast anyway to easily close the distance between the enemies. Guns have scarce ammo than other usual shooters, to also encourage the use of melee combat. Which is nice because the game is at its best when you are mostly using swordplay to kill enemies.\r\nUsing the katana for melee combat allows for dismemberments which are always a welcome feature. The pistol is used effectively; just as frequently as your primary weapon, but it mostly functions as a melee attack and can’t be aimed manually.\r\nWhen you stun an enemy, you can do a takedown, which is basically a stylish way to kill your enemy while in a locked animation with them. These takedowns are cool and satisfying, but some are a little bit too long winded and can otherwise break the flow of momentum of combat.\r\nProgression wise, there is a typical skill tree unlock system to offer some form of progression to the player with three main categories; Offense, Defense, and Utility. There you can unlock abilities, like an extended dodge maneuver, or a bullet-time system. It’s not the most complex system but it does its job of keeping the player engaged, looking forward to the next unlock to try.\r\nThe graphics on the other hand are a bit aged and look like something that came out of the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, but slightly remastered for today’s standards with a decent lighting system. Which isn't always a bad thing, but disappointed me with my expectations of an AAA game.\r\nFor much of my initial experience, Wanted: Dead is a video game that is somewhere between fun and boring. The game's hack-n-slash melee combat and third-person shooter gameplay provide players with a diverse range of combat options. I found it fun at times, but ultimately falls short overall with its janky melee combat, uninspired third person shooter gameplay, and a forgettable premise.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4539151) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Wanted: Dead, we’ve all seen this type of game before: A hack-n-slash and shooter hybrid — Devil May Cry is a touchstone example of this, — as well as most shooter games that have some form of melee combat baked in, but still, it's refreshing to see newcomers in the hack and slash shooter hybrid genre.",

Your mission is to uncover a corporate conspiracy in a cyberpunk world full of cybernetic mercenaries, gangs, and private militaries.\r\nCyberpunk and a Hong Kong crime story?\r\nThe game features various environments inspired by Hong Kong infused with Cyberpunk elements. The level design is varied, with a mix of open spaces like lobbies and tight corridors and hallways that keep the action fresh and alternating.\r\nMore gameplay, less story\r\nThe story is unfortunately nothing special, just a generic cyberpunk setup that really doesn’t captivate you or keep you invested — Mainly a poor excuse to continue killing baddies. Thankfully, it immediately, and always gives way to the gameplay which is the main focus. Cutscenes are few and far between and the story is forgettable and ignorable. This game is best played to have fun killing enemies, not to experience a gripping story.\r\nIt’s so bad that it’s good?\r\nThe main character’s voice is rather bland and monotonous at face value, especially with its out of place European-esque accent. In fact, it’s probably the worst performance out of everyone. Ironically, it’s just so bad that it’s a refreshing performance for me, instead of the usual cute or seductive voice actors used for female hero archetypes.\r\nThe other supporting characters are equally as bland if not generic and forgettable. However, some of the bosses at the end of the missions have some cool over-the-top cyberpunk / anime personalities to it that reminded me of the bosses of the Metal Gear Solid game series.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay is more interesting than the story. At its core, it is a third person cover shooter but with a very agile character who can do athletic maneuvers, one that can easily close the distance with enemies and allow you to blend in some hack and slash combat action. You have three other teammates beside you fighting, but they’re mostly background flavor without any interaction or command system and do not really impact the gameplay in a meaningful way.\r\nMelee > Guns\r\nAs a third person cover shooter, Wanted: Dead is lame and uninspired — guns have almost no punch to them and sound like toys. It’s not satisfying to shoot and hit enemies, especially with most of them having a bullet sponge nature. However, combined with the hack and slash element, the gameplay gets to work.\r\nDespite having janky and clunky animations, both with the character and her interactions with enemies, you can do pretty amazing combos with the melee combat, as well as allowing players to seamlessly switch between swordplay and gunplay to take down enemies in a variety of ways, as Lt. Stone moves fast anyway to easily close the distance between the enemies. You can dodge, block, and parry enemies to help you in combat.\r\nTo also encourage the use of melee combat, guns have scarce ammo compared to other usual shooters. Which is nice because the game is at its best when you are mostly using swordplay to kill enemies.\r\nYou have two main weapons in the game which can be customized, the main rifle and your go-to pistol. The game also offers a standard selection of projectile weapons, including assault rifles, SMGs, LMGs, and grenade launchers that you can pick-up from dead enemies.\r\nUsing the katana for melee combat allows for dismemberments which are always a welcome feature. The pistol is used effectively; just as frequently as your primary weapon, but it effectively functions as a melee attack and can’t be aimed manually.\r\nKilling with style\r\nWhen you stun an enemy, you can do a takedown, which is basically a stylish way to kill your enemy while in a locked animation with them. The takedowns in Wanted: Dead are brutal and gory, and there are over 50 unique finishing moves for players to perform.\r\nThese finishing moves are cool, and they provide players with a sense of satisfaction when they perform them, but some are a little bit too long winded and can otherwise break the flow of momentum of combat.\r\nAside from the usual gun-wielding and melee-wielding enemies to mirror the player’s combat style, there are also other types. For example, a shield-wielding type, that can give the player a ton of problems and difficulties, to the point that it’s annoying and it completely breaks the combat rhythm of the game.\r\nMetal Gear Solid-esque boss fights\r\nEvery mission, there is also a boss fight to cap it off, which as said earlier, reminded me of the boss fights from the Metal Gear Series: Cool over-the-top cyberpunk / anime personalities and a matching over-the-top set piece for the fight.\r\nProgression wise, there is a typical skill tree unlock system to offer some form of progression to the player with three main categories; Offense, Defense, and Utility. There you can unlock abilities, like an extended dodge maneuver, or a bullet-time system. It’s not the most complex system but it does its job of keeping the player engaged, looking forward to the next unlock to try.\r\nGame Length\r\nThe game is too short for its price, at only around five missions total with up to an hour of gameplay each, totalling to five hours of gameplay to beat the story.  There is a harder difficulty that you can try to challenge, but it mostly just makes it harder by removing health from recovering, or removing finishers, which is basically removing half of the fun factor.\r\nThe graphics on the other hand are a bit aged and look like something that came out of the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, but slightly remastered for today’s standards with a decent lighting system. The cutscenes are slightly better looking versions of the in-game graphics, something that reminded me of Tekken 4's cutscenes. All of which isn't a bad thing, but disappointed me with my expectations of an AAA game.\r\nBeatable in around five hours with almost no replay value aside from the increased difficulty setting, Wanted: Dead is a short-lived average experience that isn’t just worth the AAA price of admission. It is a game that is more acceptable when acquired in a heavily discounted matter.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4548170) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Wild Hearts is a new game that offers a unique blend of Monster Hunter-style gameplay and Fortnite building mechanics: an ancient technology called Karakuri magic. Players take on the role of a customizable hunter tasked with tracking down and defeating massive monsters known as Kemono, which are negatively affecting the world of Azuma and its inhabitants.\r\nThe game features a mix of exploration, combat, base building, and crafting. While the game is not an open-world title, it offers several large areas for players to freely explore. Each area is packed with hidden secrets, crafting materials, and challenging enemies, from harmless creatures to gigantic monsters that offer a unique experience every time. The world of Azuma feels alive,  heavily inspired by Japanese and Chinese culture, which is evident in its design and aesthetics. The attention to detail in the environment and level design is impressive.\r\nAt the start, we are greeted with an unnamed hunter, in which we can customize. The character creation impressed me straight away, as it boasts an expansive character creation system with great attention to detail. Many types of voices, faces, are available. Even the hair is highly customizable with different combinations of hair style, bangs, and color available. You also get a modern approach to gender with the option of a neutral pronoun identification.\r\nThe is backstory is open-ended and vaguely customizable while the story is a little laid back, just a hunter-wanderer who traveled to Azuma looking for a purpose. That very purpose may very well be saving Azume from these Kemono and taking back the land.\r\nOnce you complete the tutorial, Wild Hearts also features a fully integrated multiplayer experience, which adds an extra layer of fun to the game.  You can team up with two other players, either strangers or friends, and you can even join players on other platforms thanks to crossplay. With the semi open nature of the game, you can hunt Kemono together, or complete missions and quests that have you hunt down specific monsters.\r\nWild Hearts tries to make the gameplay novel by remixing some Fortnite elements into the game. By way of an ancient technology called Karakuri that allows you to instantly craft contraptions such as square blocks, bouncepads, and base building tools such as a tent, forge, and a fireplace. The concept seems out of place at first, something that’s not really needed by this gameplay archetype, but as it turns out, they work really well when integrated with the exploration, base building, platforming elements into the game, and they also blend well with the combat too, by using blocks and bounce pads to jump and dodge around monsters and to inflict heavier damage.\r\nThe combat can be quite tactical and rewarding, and it looks cool too, as Wild Hearts prioritizes flashy animations with a style over substance attitude. However, one downside is that the controls can feel a bit stiff and unresponsive due to the inability to cancel animations. But this is how Monster Hunter works, so it's a part of the genre's charm.\r\nThe players need to plan their attacks and make each one count, as there are consequences for reckless button-mashing. This adds an additional layer of challenge to the game, making it all the more satisfying when you take down a Kemono.\r\nUnfortunately despite all the game’s bells and whistles, the game's performance is abysmal and unacceptable on PC as well as consoles, considering it doesn’t really look good either. The graphics can be blurry even at maximum settings. This can be a significant drawback, particularly for players who value graphical fidelity and stable performance.\r\nDespite this, Wild Hearts offers an enjoyable and unique experience for players who enjoy Monster Hunter-style gameplay with a twist. Here’s hoping they can patch up the performance and graphical issues soon.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4560227) Originally posted on TapTap.",

By way of an ancient technology called Karakuri.\r\nWild Hearts allows you to instantly craft contraptions such as square blocks, bouncepads, and base building structures such as a tent, a forge, and a fireplace. As you play the game, you can also unlock more complex contraptions like a Hunting Tower, or a zipline to help your player travel across the vast landscape. All of this is made possible by a resource called Threads extracted in the trees, rocks, and plants, in traditional base builder fashion.\r\nThe concept seems out of place and so Meta at first, something that’s not really needed by this gameplay archetype, but as it turns out, they work really well when integrated with the exploration, base building, and platforming elements into the game. They also blend well with the combat too, by using blocks and bounce pads ”springs” to jump and dodge around monsters and to inflict heavier damage.\r\n## Heavy Asian influences\r\nThe world of Azuma feels alive, heavily inspired by Japanese and Chinese culture, which is evident in its design and aesthetics. The attention to detail in the environment and level design is impressive. The technology in this world is mostly wooden based, but infused with ancient technology that looks like magic.\r\nYou will even have companions that look like wooden Star Wars droids to follow you around. While the world is stunning artistically, as far as the 3D graphics go, it’s utterly below average looking.\r\n## Deep character customization\r\nAt the start, we are greeted with an unnamed hunter, in which we can customize.

That very purpose may very well be saving Azuma from these Kemono and taking back the land.\r\nThe narrative of Wild Hearts explores themes of redemption, finding purpose, and the bond between humans and nature. The story is presented through in-game cutscenes and interactions with characters, some as mysterious as the Kemono themselves, some just simple inhabitants of the world trying to survive.\r\nThe voice acting is decent, but don’t expect AAA level quality for the lip syncing and facial animations. While the story may not be the game's primary focus, it is engaging enough to provide a backdrop for the gameplay to take place, and players will find themselves invested in their character’s journey.\r\n## It’s playable in co-op, too.\r\nOnce you complete the tutorial, Wild Hearts also features a fully integrated multiplayer experience, which adds an extra layer of fun to the game. You can team up with two other players, either strangers or friends, and you can even join players on other platforms thanks to crossplay.

You have to pay attention to their attacks first and master and memorize their movements before trying.\r\nIn co-op multiplayer, players can combine their Karakuri to build and utilize contraptions and items like springs, traps, and Bulawarks to better take down monsters and prevent them from using their most devastating attacks. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, making it even more exciting and rewarding.\r\nPlayers have access to eight different weapon types, each with its unique move set, strengths, weaknesses, and upgrades. From the quick and agile Wagasa (A bladed umbrella) to the powerful and devastating Katana, there is a weapon type for every playstyle. The combat is fast-paced, and incredibly satisfying, with each hit feeling impactful and weighty. The game's monster boss fights — while long winded and difficult — are particularly memorable, with each Kemono requiring a unique approach and strategy to take down.\r\nIn addition to the combat, Wild Hearts also offers a robust crafting system that allows players to create and upgrade camps, weapons, and armor. The crafting system is intuitive and easy to use, with an overwhelming amount of resource types to gather and discover. The ability to create and customize weapons and armor adds another layer of depth to the gameplay and ensures that players are always striving to improve and evolve their character.\r\nAll in all, the main story is expected to keep you busy for more than 40 hours, and as with these Monster Hunter type games, with great potential for more.\r\n## Major Performance Issues, better wait for a patch!\r\nUnfortunately despite all the gameplay’s promising bells and whistles, the game's performance is abysmal and unacceptable on PC as well as consoles, considering it doesn’t really look good either. The graphics can be blurry even at maximum settings.\r\nI have tested this with my PC with an i7-8700k, 32GB, and RTX 3080, and the game suffered heavy framerate drops below 60, regardless of the graphics settings. The frametimes are also all over the place, never flatlining in any instance ever, providing a consistent stuttery experience. This can be a significant drawback, particularly for players who value graphical fidelity and stable performance.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nIf these major performance issues are remedied, Wild Hearts is a must-play for Monster Hunter enthusiasts, that is, if you can swallow the “next-gen” AAA launch price of $70. With a well-realized tactical combat system, memorable boss fights, and an impressive variety of weapons and armor to craft, Wild Hearts is a game that will keep players occupied for hours.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4567477) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Elderand is a 2D retro-inspired action platformer that has recently been released, and it is not for the faint of heart.\r\nYou play as a mercenary chosen because of a mysterious prophecy to eradicate the land of evil. The game is a skill-based combat game where players must face terrifying creatures and beings to progress through the game.\r\nThe game features Metroivanian elements and good looking pixel graphics that reminds me of Dead Cells. However, it's not really a roguelite. When you die, you revive to the last saved fireplace that you activated, with no checkpoints or rogue-like resets.\r\nFurthermore, the similarities in names can be quite misleading, but Elderand is not an Elder Ring clone, in fact, it's far from it, maybe except for the insane difficulty level.\r\nThe visuals are crisp and clean-looking, and the controls feel responsive and smooth. The platforming elements are fun to perform especially when unlocking new types of movements like double jump and a grappling hook to reach new areas.\r\nThe artstyle features chibi-esque looking characters contrasted by a handcrafted gothic looking world with a demonic, cultic, and creepy atmosphere that can make one's flesh crawl. You can travel across varying levels of landscapes from underground caves to old castle ruins filled with dangers: alive, dead, or inanimate.\r\nThe combat on the other hand is extremely unforgiving. Since Elderand is a 2D game, the margin of error is smaller and there’s not much dimensional space available to the player, making combat harder. Your health bar isn’t particularly high, and the enemies can attack you relentlessly with barrages of ranged and melee attacks. Dodges, dashes, and jumps must be precise in order for the player to survive. It’s impossible not to die too many times for the average player.\r\nWhen things are action-packed, the visual effects clutter the screen. The screen also shakes violently, so some important visual cues can be hard to see. Luckily, you can turn this screen shake off to mitigate some annoyances.\r\nThe RPG elements of Elderand give players the opportunity to customize their experience to suit their preferred playstyle, from character appearance to their skills, stats, and weapon loadout.\r\nYou can equip two weapon loadouts at a time, for example a sword and shield and a bow and arrow, can seamlessly switch between them at will. In addition, you also have throwables and consumables at your disposal. Eventually, respecs will become free, allowing you to try out other builds without much grind or without restarting your progress, giving players a freedom to theorycraft and experiment.\r\nElderand’s beautiful pixel art coupled with the highly skill-based combat system and engaging platforming gameplay has resulted in a satisfactory experience for me so far. The difficulty may be overwhelming for some players, but overall, Elderand is worth checking out for fans of the metroidvania genre.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4567476) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "There’s been a resurgence of Metroidvania games lately, and it’s not stopping anytime soon. Elderand is another addition to the growing list, and it is not for the faint of heart, both with regard to gameplay and theme.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Satisfying skill-based combat\r\n- A highly detailed pixel art world## Cons\r\n-The story is not exactly gripping\r\nYou play as a mercenary chosen because of a mysterious prophecy to eradicate the land of evil. This prophecy seemed to be ill-fated right from the very start, sinking your ship and leaving your crew dead and you stranded on an ominous island that is to be our game’s setting.\r\n## \"I don't know their meaning, but it can't be good\"\r\nThe story is not exactly gripping, and can be pretentious at times with its extremely cryptic texts and dialogue. Players can also collect scattered letters and journals from the poor souls who came before them to learn more about the lore and story. There is no voice dialogue, so everything is in text form. Fortunately, the enigmatic retro-inspired soundtrack is decent enough to provide a haunting audio experience while playing the game.\r\nElderand features Metroivanian elements and good looking pixel graphics that reminds me of Dead Cells. The visuals are crisp and clean-looking, and the controls feel responsive and smooth.\r\nA beautiful pixel world\r\nThe game's hand-drawn pixel art world is detailed, and the attention to detail is impressive in everything from the character sprites to the mesmerizing background landscape. The artstyle features chibi-esque looking characters contrasted by a handcrafted gothic looking world with a demonic, cultic, and creepy atmosphere that can make one's flesh crawl.\r\nYou can travel across varying levels of landscapes, everything from the underground caves to old castle ruins filled with dangers: alive, dead, or inanimate, all add to the game's haunting atmosphere. The gothic aesthetics and level design are well done, and the world is full of surprises and provides players with diverse environments to explore.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe platforming elements are fun to perform especially when unlocking new types of movements like a double jump and a grappling hook to reach new previously unreachable areas. This also comes with exploration elements that reward players with loot and upgrades for their weapons. The world isn’t exactly linear, prepare to backtrack a lot if you want to explore every nook and cranny that this game has to offer.\r\nNot for the faint-hearted\r\nOne of the main highlights of the Elderand is the highly skill-based combat game where players must face over 60 terrifying creatures and beings; and around a dozen bosses that provide players with a lot of challenge, requiring a different approach or tactic for each of these enemy types to progress through the game. The combat is extremely unforgiving. Since Elderand is a 2D game, the margin of error is smaller and there’s not much dimensional space available to the player to dodge projectiles and attacks, making combat harder than usual.\r\nAttacks also happen in stationary, so attacking while running is impossible. It’s a small detail but one that significantly changes how the game is played. The combat becomes more tactical and deadly, but also more predictable and methodical.\r\nYour health bar isn’t particularly high, and the enemies can attack you relentlessly with barrages of ranged and melee attacks. Dodges, dashes, and jumps must be precise in order for the player to survive. It’s impossible not to die too many times for the average player. Thankfully the controls are responsive and has never failed me.\r\nPossible misconceptions\r\nDespite some similarities to Dead Cells, it's not really a roguelite. When you die, you revive to the last saved fireplace that you activated, with no checkpoints or rogue-like resets.\r\nFurthermore, the similarities in names can be quite misleading, but Elderand is not an Elder Ring clone, in fact, it's far from it, maybe except for the insane difficulty level.\r\nWhen things are action-packed, the visual effects clutter the screen. The screen also shakes violently, so some important visual cues can be hard to see. Luckily, you can turn this screen shake off to mitigate some annoyances.\r\nLight RPG and customization elements\r\nThe light RPG elements of Elderand give players the opportunity to customize their experience to suit their preferred playstyle, from character appearance to their skills, stats, and weapon loadout. Merchants will also be encountered throughout your journey to help you customize your gear.\r\nYou can equip two weapon loadouts at a time, for example a sword and shield and a bow and arrow, can seamlessly switch between them at will. In addition, you also have throwables and consumables at your disposal. Eventually, respecs will become free, allowing you to try out other builds without much grind or without restarting your progress, giving players a freedom to theorycraft and experiment.\r\nWhile these build and weapon loadouts do make a difference, it still all boils down to the skill-based combat for you to successfully progress through the game and not die trying again and again. For the whole story, Elderand is beatable in under ten hours, with some degree of replayability due to different weapons and builds you can try.\r\nOne of the few issues with Elderand is that the game's difficulty can be overwhelming at times. The game is designed to be challenging, but it may be frustrating for some players who do not have a lot of experience with this type of game. The combat system is skill-based with a bit of memorization needed, and it can take some time AKA deaths, to master.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4588094) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Brotato is a brand new mobile-port of the acclaimed PC game of the same name, a survival rogue-lite game that you can play with only one hand, now currently in Open Beta.\r\nIn Brotato, you control a character from a selection of five different classes with different starting stats and bonuses. Then you get to pick your starting weapon and difficulty modifiers (if unlocked, eventually).\r\nThere is zero story to this and it‘s just pure mindless fun. There’s not even a tutorial. It's a show don’t tell situation where you really have to stumble your way into the game to try and learn it. It’s simple anyway: Enemies come in waves, you have to move your character around to avoid enemy attacks. The weapons are all auto-targetted and auto-fired based on your attack speed and range stat.\r\nEach wave requires you to survive a specific amount of seconds before starting the next wave. In between waves, you get to buy randomized weapons and items to shape your build according to your playstyle or experimentation.\r\nBesides that, you have an EXP bar where you gain experience points upon killing mobs and upon leveling up you get to choose a random stat increase. All random item and stat choices can be rerolled unlimited times as long as you have the currency, which is collected by killing mobs.\r\nThis happens every run and always reset after every death, making it a rogue-lite. It’s a fun mechanic for the players to constantly try out other builds and experiment to their liking, ensuring that all runs are not the same.\r\nThe game is simply addicting because of this gameplay loop of trying and trying to beat your previous record and survive into higher waves, and it doesn’t require much brain power to play the game anyway which only requires playing with only one hand to control the movement.\r\nUnfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a way to make it play in portrait mode, despite seemingly supporting it judging from the patch notes I’ve found online. There is also no option to activate the manual aiming option like the PC version, despite being in the Google Play Store game description.\r\nKilling enemies and clearing hordes of enemies in Brotato is satisfying and it's gratifying to see your current build mowing down groups of baddies. On the other hand, when things get a bit too hard, narrowly escaping hordes of powerful enemies is extremely satisfying as well. Resulting into an experience that is addicting from start to end.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Popularized by the pioneer game Vampire Survivors, this new sub-genre that it spawned doesn’t even have an official name right now. Some call it action rogue-lite, some call it bullet hell survival — One thing is certain, people can’t get enough of this addicting game genre.\r\nBrotato is essentially one of these Vampire survivors-clones and it’s now out soon on Mobile Phones, currently in beta testing phase. It’s a mobile-port of a PC game still in Early Access on Steam, and is one of the most popular games on the platform with tens of thousands of overwhelmingly positive reviews.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Surprisingly addicting gameplay loop\r\n- action-packed and fast paced gameplay\r\n- Mindless fun, can play with just one hand\r\n- One of the best alternatives to Vampire Survivors## Cons\r\n-Some minor missing features (Beta test problems)\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the genre, it’s basically a bullet-hell wave roguelite survival game, where you control only the movement of your character, and all the skills and damage dealers just fire automatically. It’s almost an idle game of sorts, but you still have to move the character to avoid the waves of enemies and projectiles that can kill you, or in simpler terms, a moving lone tower defense game.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nIn Brotato, you control a character from a selection of five different classes with different starting stats and bonuses. Then, you get to pick your starting weapon and difficulty modifiers (if unlocked, eventually).\r\nThere is zero story to this and it‘s just pure mindless fun. There’s not even a tutorial. It's a show don’t tell situation where you really have to stumble your way into the game to try and learn it. It’s simple anyway: Enemies come in waves, you have to move your character around to avoid dangers. The weapons are all auto-targetted and auto-fired based on your attack speed and range stat.\r\nThe graphics of Brotato give off an early 2000s Adobe Flash cartoonish vibes, instead of the usual retro or pixel art graphics that other contemporaries have. Yes, it might feel cheap or look like something made for kids, but the amazing gameplay more than makes up for it.\r\nThe genre is surprisingly addicting\r\nEach wave requires you to survive a specific amount of seconds before starting the next wave. In between waves, you get to buy randomized weapons and items to shape your build according to your playstyle or experimentation.  If you're short on currency, you can lock interesting items so that you can buy them later.\r\nBesides that, you have an EXP bar where you gain experience points upon killing mobs and upon leveling up you get to choose a random stat increase. All random item and stat choices can be rerolled unlimited times as long as you have the currency, which is collected by killing mobs.\r\nThere are multiple weapons to equip, up to six at a time --- all simultaneously firing --- ranging from guns like shotguns and pistols to melee and magic weapons like knives and wands. You can upgrade them too, by fusing two weapons of the same quality to upgrade them to the next level of rarity represented by colors, it’s not as deep as the Vampire Survivors system, but it's still a fun and engaging mechanic to play.\r\nThis gameplay loop happens every run and always reset after every death, making it a rogue-lite. It’s a fun mechanic for the players to constantly try out other builds and experiment to their liking, ensuring that all runs are not the same.\r\nCompared to Vampire Survivors, the game is more action-packed and fast paced, with a constant barrage of waves of enemies, easily disposable by your powerful guns and weapons.\r\nOnly one control, perfect for mobile phones.\r\nThe game is simply addicting because of this gameplay loop of trying and trying to beat your previous record and survive into higher waves, and it doesn’t require much brain power to play the game anyway which only requires playing with only one hand to control the movement.\r\nPersonally, I find myself leaning towards using guns all the time, as I feel that they are the most powerful, considering the more action-packed and fast paced gameplay nature of the game.\r\nKilling enemies and clearing hordes of enemies is satisfying and it's gratifying to see your current build able to mow down groups of baddies. On the other hand, when things get a bit too hard, narrowly escaping hordes of powerful enemies is extremely satisfying as well. Resulting into an experience that is addicting from start to end.\r\nIt’s still in beta\r\nUnfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a way to make it play in portrait mode, despite seemingly supporting it judging from the patch notes I’ve found online. There is also no option to activate the manual aiming option like the PC version, despite being in the Google Play Store game description.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4594200) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Atomic Heart is an action FPS game that completely caught me by surprise. For an upcoming new developer — Mundfish —  who has only developed a now discontinued VR game so far, that hasn’t stopped them from delivering an impressive game, and they have really hit it out of the park with this one.\r\nThe graphics are absolutely stunning, and the optimization is surprisingly impressive. The world they've created is highly immersive, and it's a cross between Bioshock in gameplay and premise, and Fallout in presentation and humor. With also traces of Wolfenstein and Half-Life sprinkled onto it. It's set in a beautiful jaw dropping rendition of a Soviet utopian society with an atompunk twist with all the cool technology and sci-fi elements seen.\r\nAtomic Heart puts us in the shoes of Major Nechaev, a highly skilled soldier caught in a tragic uprising featuring rogue robots and gruesome mutants. His mission is to stop this uprising and reveal what is the true cause behind all of this chaos. Unlike other popular FPS characters, Major Nechaev talks a lot, bursting with entertaining personality and humorous commentary about everything around him.\r\nThe soundtrack that accompanies all of this is also equally amazing, resulting in goosebumps after goosebumps because it compliments the action really well. It’s not all action though, as Atomic Heart is also a terrifying game that can also be classified as a horror-game, with the unnerving soviet environment, uncanny looking robots and monsters, and an occasional low-key jump scare moments.\r\nThe first hour of the story is basically a glorified tram ride tutorial with some pretty smooth plot exposition to get you up to speed with the lore. From there, chaos breaks loose and we’re now slowly introduced to the gameplay mechanics, starting with the melee combat.\r\nThe explosive combat in Atomic Heart is finely tuned. Aside from using traditional FPS melee and shooter elements, You can dodge in all directions to avoid melee attacks, and you have a “Force Lightning” skill called “Shock” along with two other ability slots to equip other unlocked skills throughout the game, like Frost or Telekinesis. Ammo is scarce and the skill abilities you use have limited uses, every combat mechanic is just in the right amount of availability to make everything well balanced and utilized. The combat is weighty and each swing and ammo counts.\r\nThe game rewards exploration by providing more resources for the player to use in upgrades, as well as providing bits of lore and backstory by way of voice diaries. Platforming elements are present, but lightly implemented with some sections requiring you to scale walls and obstacles and avoid environmental hazards.\r\nThere are also all kinds of lock-picking puzzles from the typical Bethesda formula to more novel ways of hacking doors, providing an welcome breather from all the robot and mutant mashing.\r\nWeapon and character upgrades are available using the resources you loot from the levels and enemies. You can customize your melee and guns and fuse them with different bonuses, including elemental damages. It adds an extra layer of strategy to the combat that is both enjoyable and rewarding.\r\nAs a first impression, I am thoroughly impressed with Atomic Heart. The beautiful graphics, immersive world, engaging story, and finely tuned combat make for a fantastic gaming experience. This game is a testament to what even a new developer can accomplish with the right amount of talent, passion, and time.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4606392) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Atomic Heart is a new Action-FPS game with RPG, Open World, and horror elements, set in a utopian soviet-era society gone wrong.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Finely tuned compelling combat\r\n- Stunning graphics and level design\r\n- Main character is full of personality\r\n- Smooth performance and optimization## Cons\r\n-Open-world feels out of place\r\nAfter a string of disappointing New AAA IP releases recently, I was worried about Atomic Heart. It’s a new IP from a new developer, and it’s an AAA title. I feared it was going to have disappointing gameplay, poor performance issues, or worse, both.\r\nFortunately, we finally hit the mark with Atomic Heart as it is neither of those things. Joining Dead Space and Hogwarts Legacy as recent quality titles in the AAA gaming space.\r\nAtomic Heart is a game that completely caught me by surprise. For an upcoming new developer — Mundfish —  who has only developed a now discontinued VR game so far, that hasn’t stopped them from delivering an impressive game, and they have really hit it out of the park with this one.\r\nStanding on the shoulders of some FPS giants\r\nThe graphics are absolutely stunning, and the optimization is surprisingly impressive. The world they've created is highly immersive, and it's a cross between Bioshock in gameplay and premise, and Fallout in presentation and humor. With also traces of Wolfenstein, Half-Life, and Dead Island sprinkled onto it with an alternate post-WW2 alternate history and survival horror elements. It's set in a beautiful jaw dropping rendition of a Soviet utopian society with an atompunk twist with all the cool technology and sci-fi elements seen.\r\nAtomic Heart puts us in the shoes of Major Nechaev, a highly skilled soldier caught in a tragic uprising featuring rogue robots and gruesome mutants. His mission is to stop this uprising and reveal what is the true cause behind all of this chaos.\r\nA talkative protagonist\r\nUnlike other popular FPS characters, Major Nechaev talks a lot, bursting with entertaining personality and humorous commentary about everything around him. The sarcastic banter with his AI robot adds a lot of depth to the story and makes even the otherwise boring elevator and on-a-rail sequences in the game amusing.\r\nAll these boring waiting parts comprise only a small percentage of the game however as Atomic Heart features explosive action set-pieces one after the other, both cutscene or in-game form. Giving you a blockbuster level of cinematic eye candy that looks like it wants to top everything that came before.\r\nThe soundtrack that accompanies all of this is also equally amazing, resulting in goosebumps after goosebumps because it compliments the action really well. It’s not all action though, as Atomic Heart is also a terrifying game that can also be classified as a horror-game, with the unnerving soviet environment, uncanny looking robots and monsters, and an occasional low-key jump scare moments.\r\nThe level design is amazing in this game. After wowing us with an impressive sprawling flying soviet city, it takes us to Facility 3826 — where most of the game is set — a massive research complex that not only includes indoor laboratories, narrow hallways, but also its immediate surroundings: featuring woodlands and mountains traversable in an open world fashion.\r\nThe first hour of the story is basically a glorified tram ride tour / tutorial with some pretty smooth plot exposition to get you up to speed with the lore. From there, chaos breaks loose and we’re now slowly introduced to the gameplay mechanics, starting with the melee combat.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nAtomic Heart is not your traditional FPS game. The combat is weighty and each swing and ammo counts. You can’t just go around bunny hopping and spamming your weapons around like a madman.  It is more tactical when it comes to combat.\r\nThe combat in Atomic Heart is finely tuned. Aside from having traditional FPS melee and shooter elements, You can dodge in all directions to avoid melee attacks, and you have a “Force Lightning” skill called “Shock” along with two other ability slots to equip other unlocked skills throughout the game, like Frost or Telekinesis.\r\nAmmo is scarce and the skill abilities you use have limited uses, every combat mechanic is just in the right amount of availability to make everything well balanced and utilized.\r\nHits and damages, especially melee attacks, are visually seen in enemies with great detail, with slashes and cuts accurately imprinted depending on the swing of your weapon, making attacks feel more impactful and adding to the immersion.\r\nWeapon and character upgrades are available using the resources you loot from the levels and enemies. You can customize your melee and guns and fuse them with different bonuses, including elemental damages. It adds an extra layer of strategy to the combat that is both enjoyable and rewarding.\r\nAtomic Heart takes a page out of Resident Evil by introducing Saferooms called Break Rooms, taking you out of the danger and letting you save your progress and sometimes offer upgrades as well.\r\nThe game also rewards exploration by providing more resources for the player to use in upgrades, as well as providing bits of lore and backstory by way of voice diaries. Platforming elements are present, but lightly implemented with some sections requiring you to scale walls or obstacles and avoid environmental hazards.\r\nThere are also all kinds of lock-picking puzzles from the typical Bethesda formula to more novel ways of hacking doors, providing a welcome breather from all the robot and mutant mashing.\r\nStealth elements are also present in the game, sometimes requiring you to use stealth in order to avoid unnecessary confrontations or to avoid bringing in more enemies than you need.\r\nOpen-World is not always a good thing\r\nAfter a few hours in, when you unlock the open-world section, the game hits a lull and shows signs of over ambitiousness, the open-world mechanic feels forced; there’s nothing compelling to do in it besides being a massive area that just exists as a barren playground.\r\nYou’re mostly going to be interested in the narrative anyway, in which the open-world nature gets in the way of. Atomic Heart is at its best when it is a linear FPS experience like Bioshock or Half-Life, it strayed too much on the Fallout and Dead Island side with the inclusion of open-world, and the formula just doesn’t work.\r\nBesides the lackluster open-world, most of the gameplay elements are well designed, from the combat system, to the level progression. Even the looting is immensely satisfying and user friendly. You no longer need to painstakingly press the loot button on every container or item you see, you just hold it and it will automatically pull in, open all containers, and satisfyingly suck all lootable items like a mini Black Hole.\r\nTechnical Performance\r\nFrom my experience with my setup of i7-8700k, 32GB and RTX 3080, installed on an NVMe SSD. Atomic Heart loads fast, and performs very smoothly even when the settings are maxed out. Even on the Steam Deck, it can perform at around 60fps when using the default setting. Honestly, after all the recent release disappointments regarding poor PC optimization, seeing a game that looks and performs great as this at launch, is truly a sight to behold.\r\nIt tried to do everything on its first try, and it got the majority of it right, delivering an impressive game on all fronts: technical, storytelling, and gameplay. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good FPS game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4613094) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Digimon World: Next Order is a familiar game that will delight PC and Switch-wielding fans of the Digimon franchise, more specifically, Digimon World fans. The game has been recently ported and released to the Nintendo Switch and PC platforms.\r\nIn Digimon World: Next Order, players assume the role of a human character (the player can name the protagonist in the beginning of the game) who is transported to the Digital World and must explore and help save it from a state of chaos. Just like the original Digimon World, Machinedramon is once again the source of these problems. The game mechanics involve collecting and training Digimon, battling enemies, and exploring the game world.\r\nThe port is mostly the same game that was released 7 years ago for the PS Vita and PS4 in the following year. But with some minor quality of life changes that are more targeted towards newcomers and beginners, with the addition of a beginner mode difficulty and a run button which allows the character to move faster than the original speed.\r\nIn Digimon World: Next Order, players must navigate the Digital World and recruit Digimon to their team. Once a Digimon is recruited, the player can feed it, train it, and care for it to improve its stats, which determine how well it performs in battle. Different Digimon have different strengths and weaknesses, so players must strategize and choose their team carefully.\r\nPartner Digimons will inevitably die in time and is a normal part of gameplay, allowing you to start them again as babies and repeat the cycle again, trying out new possible ways to evolve your Digimon, in a rogue-like-esque fashion.\r\nBattles in Digimon World: Next Order are real-time and take place in the game world, with the player controlling two Digimon at once. The player can issue strategic commands to their Digimon, such as attack, defend, or use special abilities, and the Digimons will automatically battle. During battles, players must monitor their Digimon's health and MP (memory points) and choose actions accordingly.\r\nThe combat system is well-designed and engaging, with real-time battles that require strategic thinking, careful planning, and decisive actions. The ability to control two Digimon in battle and to use their unique abilities makes battles more interesting and dynamic. The visuals and how the battles are represented are also more visually appealing and action-packed, especially when using special moves, complete with matching awesome anime-inspired soundtrack.\r\nThe game world in Digimon World: Next Order is vast and varied, with multiple areas to explore and discover. Players can encounter NPCs, take on quests, and battle powerful bosses in their journey to save the Digital World. The game also features a day and night cycle, with some events and quests only available during certain times of the day.\r\nConsidering the game was originally made for the PS Vita, the game's graphics are still neat and have aged well, with vibrant colors, lighthearted tones, and detailed anime character and creature designs that bring the Digital World to life, even more than before. The game's music is also well-composed and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game, especially when in battles.\r\nIf you're a fan of the Digimon franchise or looking for a fun and engaging role-playing game with some exploration and pet-caring aspects, this is definitely one to check out, although the launch price is a bit high at $60, especially for a 7 year old game.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Digimon World: Next Order is the much needed spiritual successor to the original Digimon World and its remake, Digimon World Re: Digitize.\r\nIt’s not exactly a new title, but due to platform availability, I haven’t had the chance to play it yet until now , as the game has now been recently ported and released to the Nintendo Switch and PC platforms.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Goes back to the original Digimon World formula\r\n- Graphics have aged well\r\n- Smooth performance\r\n- Engaging combat system\r\n- Satisfying gameplay loop## Cons\r\n-Lack of PC graphics options\r\n-Half-baked keyboard and mouse support\r\n-Steep asking price for a 7 year old game ($60)\r\nI played the original Digimon World back 20 years ago and remember being amazed at being transported into another world and having my very own Digimon story. No digital pet / monster game has given me that feeling ever since, especially that the subsequent games have totally departed from the first game’s formula.\r\nDeja vu premise\r\nIn Digimon World: Next Order, players assume the role of a teenage boy or girl (the player can name the protagonist in the beginning of the game) who is transported to the Digital World and must explore and help save it from a state of chaos. Just like the original Digimon World, Machinedramon is once again the source of these problems. The game mechanics involve collecting and training Digimon, battling enemies, and exploring the game world.\r\nNew additions with the port\r\nThe port is mostly the same game that was released 7 years ago for the PS Vita and PS4 in the following year. But with some minor quality of life changes that are more targeted towards newcomers and beginners.\r\nThe most notable addition being the new difficulty mode called the Beginner mode, which puts a cap on enemy strength. This mode makes the game more accessible to new players or those who are looking for a more relaxed and less grindy experience. It also allows players to enjoy the game's story and explore the Digital World without being constantly challenged by difficult battles.\r\nThe other feature is the addition of a RUN button, which makes Map traversal and enemy avoidance a lot easier. This is a significant improvement over the original game, as players can move more quickly through the Digital World and avoid enemy encounters if they choose to do so.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nIn Digimon World: Next Order, players must navigate the Digital World and recruit Digimon to their team. Once a Digimon is recruited, the player can feed it, train it, and care for it to improve its stats, which determine how well it performs in battle. Different Digimon have different strengths and weaknesses, so players must strategize and choose their team carefully.\r\nThis gameplay loop of training your digimon and caring for it is the core progression mechanic of the game, one that is highly addicting, although it can get repetitive and become a grindfest, especially when not playing on beginner mode.\r\nPartner Digimons will inevitably die in time and is a normal part of gameplay, allowing you to start them again as babies and repeat the cycle again, trying out new possible ways to evolve your Digimon, in a rogue-like-esque fashion.\r\nDigimon World: Next Order also features social and pet management mechanics. Players must manage their Digimon's needs, such as hunger and tiredness, to ensure they remain healthy and happy. Players can also interact with other characters in the game world and build relationships, which can lead to new quests and benefits.\r\nReal-time battles!\r\nBattles in Digimon World: Next Order are real-time and take place in the game world, with the player controlling two Digimon at once. The player can issue strategic commands to their Digimon, such as attack, defend, or use special abilities, and the Digimons will automatically battle on their own. During battles, players must monitor their Digimon's health and MP (memory points) and choose actions accordingly.\r\nThe combat system is well-designed and engaging, with real-time battles that require strategic thinking, careful planning, and decisive actions. The ability to control two Digimon in battle and to use their unique abilities makes battles more interesting and dynamic.\r\nThe visuals and how the battles are presented are also visually appealing and action-packed, especially when using special moves, complete with matching awesome anime-inspired soundtrack.\r\nDuring battle, the player's Digimon can also undergo Digivolution, which is the process of transforming into a more powerful form. There are various factors that influence which Digimon the player's Digimon can Digivolve into, such as their level, stats, and the number of battles they have won. The Digivolution system is also a fun and exciting aspect of the game, as players can see their Digimon transform into more powerful forms over time.\r\nThe “World” in Digimon World\r\nThe game world is vast and varied, with multiple areas to explore and discover. Players can encounter NPCs, take on quests, and battle powerful bosses in their journey to save the Digital World. The game also features a day and night cycle, with some events and quests only available during certain times of the day.\r\nConsidering the game was originally made for the PS Vita, the game's graphics are still neat and have aged well, with vibrant colors, lighthearted tones, and detailed anime character and creature designs that bring the Digital World to life, even more than before. The game's music is also well-composed and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game, especially when in battles.\r\nTechnical Performance\r\nWhile this is an old game and performance isn't a problem, it lacks modern graphics options, the only option being the resolution, anti-aliasing, and depth of field.\r\nIt also has disappointing keyboard and mouse support as they did a lazy job in implementing button prompts. While it is still playable with keyboard and mouse, there are no in-game visual prompts for it and they still display Xbox controller icons. Having said that, the performance is indeed smooth and I have no complaints on how it runs.\r\nA 7 year old game for $60\r\nFor a port of a 7 year old game title, the high price point is asking a bit too much. Unless you’re a die-hard Digimon fan or someone who hasn’t experienced it yet with extra cash to burn and is itching to play it, I’d recommend waiting for a sale or price drop.\r\nThis is a game that will appeal to fans of the Digimon franchise and those who enjoy creature-raising and role-playing games, as highlighted by the original Digimon World game. I’d recommend waiting for a sale since the launch price is kind of high, but it’s still a great game and perhaps one of the best Digimon games to exist.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4622331) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Redemption Reapers is a dark fantasy Tactical / Strategy RPG game with heavy narrative elements and a challenging turn-based tactics gameplay.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Intriguing story, characters, and premise\r\n- Lots of CGI and cinematics to tell the story\r\n- Deep and rewarding tactical combat elements\r\n## Cons\r\n- Awful voice acting and audio mixing\r\n- Graphics are bad to average quality\r\n- Steep price for what it offers ($50)\r\nRedemption Reapers contains melodramatic and bleak narrative tones, gruesome violence, and a fitting soundtrack that is surprisingly captivating and helps to create a cohesive atmosphere. The characters and graphics look inspired by Final Fantasy with anime-looking characters and armors, set in a medieval fantasy era. The frequent CGI cutscenes, dialogues, and narration all contribute to making this game a story driven cinematic experience.\r\nThe story is about a world suddenly invaded by orc/goblin-like creatures called the Mort and it's up to our band, Sarah and the disreputable extremely outnumbered Ashen Hawk Brigade to wage guerilla warfare against the forces of Mort. Your party is composed of five playable characters, skilled warriors each with their own contradicting personalities and backstories. All of which come into play into this intriguing family dynamic.\r\n## Presentation\r\nVoice acting is inconsistent, the lip syncing and facial animations are horrendous, and emotionless. The audio mixing is too out of place with most dialogues sounding like they were recorded in a personal room using an amateur microphone.\r\nThe in-game presentation of the dialogues are a little bit underwhelming and almost something you would see in an amateur 3D visual novel, far from the flashy and action-packed CGI cutscenes that it throws you off, especially when these two things happen in a back-to-back manner.\r\nThe quality overall of the art is inconsistent. The graphics, both CGI and in-game lands somewhere between bad to average. The CGI sometimes looks decent, sometimes looking like it came from early 2000s CGI or something that was made by Source Filmmaker.\r\n## Three control options\r\nRedemption Reapers offers three control schemes, keyboard, mouse-driven, and controller support. While these options are nice to have, they can be unconventional and it may take some time to get used to them. Quality of life shortcuts and hotkeys could have been added to make the control schemes more intuitive.\r\nA neat little feature that I’ve never seen before is the ability to “move” your character around using the WASDs control scheme as a preview of sorts before making it a final move and confirming it.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nThe game and story are divided into multiple missions that you can clear by completing the objective — where in some circumstances you have a choice on what to do, maybe just passing through is enough, maybe you need to wipe all of them, or maybe you need to save someone. Aside from enemies, you will also encounter loot and collectible relics scattered.\r\nIn between the missions, you can customize your characters’ skills, items and purchase goods from the merchant. You can also “train” your character to further level them up. Each character has their own weapon type to equip and these weapons break in time, requiring repairs and replacements.\r\nDepending on the story progression, beaten maps are converted to skirmish maps that allow you to replay them again to grind for EXP and items. Gaining EXP and leveling up will increase your characters stats and give them more SP, used to unlock more skills.\r\n## Against all odds\r\nRedemption Reapers's combat is highly tactical, Your group is extremely outnumbered and it's up to you and your tactics to ensure victory over the enemies. There is no Fog of War, and you can pan around the camera to observe enemies even from across the map. However, Almost all of the characters wear black or dark outfits, making them hard to stand out from each other, especially with the inability to zoom and rotate the camera.\r\nIn chess-like fashion, characters and enemies will have different ranges depending on their attack, some can only attack to their surrounding grids, one can attack diagonally and a longer distance, one can attack ranged distances.\r\nPositional advantage is key to winning. The players and enemies alike can participate in co-op attacks when in the right range and vicinity, although for the player, it requires a simple quick-time event to initiate the co-op attack.\r\nEach attack will mandate a counter-attack from the defender, requiring you to monitor your HP as well when attacking on your turns.\r\nAt the same time, enemies attacking on their turns can die as well if they get counter-attacked by your units. Some offensive skills can affect this counter-attack mechanism as a side-effect, like the ability to avoid them, reduce the damage you receive from them, or launch an immediate riposte move for the enemy.\r\n## It’s a compelling tactical game\r\nThe skills and effects that each of the characters have in their arsenal synergize very well. The progression element of unlocking new types of skills that can turn the tide in battle is a rewarding experience.\r\nIt encourages ingenious and clever combinations of skills and smart positioning to beat the enemies that heavily outnumbers your team. Constantly changing your strategy and adaptation to what the game throws at you is a fun element that is challenging, compelling to do, and gratifying to pull off.\r\nTo top it off, the combat animations are cool and flashy. Sure, it gets repetitive eventually, but the killing blows are always satisfying to see — as long as your characters are not the one dying. Dying characters will be incapacitated from the remainder of the current battle, so you need to be extra careful in managing their HPs, especially when ending turns.\r\nOverall, Redemption Reapers could take you around 30 hours to finish this game, with the option of replaying it again at a higher difficulty. However, I don’t see any convincing reason to replay this game at all, once the story is done.\r\n## Technical Performance\r\nThe performance is stable, especially because of the fact that it doesn’t support any resolutions above 1080p, and it’s a bit lacking when it comes to the graphical options.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nRedemption Reapers is a good enough Tactical / Strategy RPG game that features an intriguing story that feels like I’m watching a fun new dark fantasy anime series. While the presentation could have been more fleshed out and the price could have been cheaper, the game's combat is highly tactical and offers a lot of depth, challenge, and satisfaction. If you are a fan of the genre, then Redemption Reapers is definitely worth checking out, especially on a sale.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4634867) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Pitstop in Purgatory is a visual novel and point-and-click adventure hybrid developed by Tymedust Games in a two-month timeframe, which is surprising considering the compelling writing.\r\nPitstop in Purgatory’s story is full of depth and thought-provoking ideas. You play as Astrid, a frustrated young actress who recently died. She wakes up and finds herself in the afterlife, but it’s not Heaven or Hell. It’s something close to a Purgatory, so that’s what they call it for her. At the start, she doesn’t remember her death and is in a state of confusion.\r\nAt the start, you are at a loss to what happened, even the cause of death of your character is not known. It stimulates your curiosity, naturally you’d want to know more about it and compels you to play and play.\r\nThe presentation of the game is in a visual novel style, with a beautiful art-style that is both loose and unstable-looking. The art-style fits perfectly with the theme of the game, as it feels messy and muddy, as if it was from a dream or a near-death experience.\r\nIn the purgatory, you can interact with other souls and even befriend some of them, and it can lead to finding more about them, and their life on Earth. A modest romantic option is available for two of the characters, but it’s not really the main focus. Your main goal is to find your purpose and feel at peace.\r\nWhile the story tells like a visual novel, it plays like a point-and-click adventure game, with items and very surface level puzzles and riddles present that are essential in advancing the dialogue, story, and progression as a whole. The puzzles and riddles add to the overall immersion of the game. They are not too difficult, but they require some creative thinking to solve. At its core, it is primarily a visual novel.\r\nAt a glance, Pitstop in Purgatory is a captivating and unique game that explores themes of death and the afterlife through a well-written story and interesting characters, all presented in a fitting beautiful art-style.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Kerbal Space Program 2, or KSP2, is essentially a space flight simulator that offers players the opportunity to design, engineer, build, and launch their own rockets, spacecraft, and planes as they attempt to explore the vast reaches of the fictional Kerbol System and beyond.\r\nPlayers control the Kerbals, an up and coming alien species living in the Kerbol Star System. They’re cute, quirky, clumsy, and funny looking green aliens that add a sense of humor and silliness to the game, providing us relief from the grim and dangerous nature of space travel.\r\nThe graphics are pleasant, with high resolution textures, advanced lighting, particle effects, and atmospheric effects like clouds. Compared to the first game, this is a welcome visual overhaul that helps create a realistic feel to match the simulator nature of the game.\r\nKerbal Space Program 2, like the first game, still features in some degree a highly realistic physics engine, which accurately models the forces and effects of gravity, aerodynamics, and orbital mechanics. This means that players must carefully plan and execute their missions, taking into account factors such as weight distribution, atmospheric drag, fuel consumption, and gravitational effects from celestial bodies.\r\nThis game is hard to learn, and hard to master. After all, players are learning real-life orbital mechanics and physics. However, the pay off is extremely rewarding once you’ve grasped the basics and now off to building rockets and launching into space. This gameplay loop of designing parts, testing them, and taking them to actual missions takes a lot of time and effort and are all entertaining from start to finish. The countless failures leading to a success makes for a very rewarding gameplay experience.\r\nThere’s not much content yet for the game, many of the features even from the first game are currently missing and are still in the pipeline of what’s to come. However, what Kerbal Space Program 2 does well is the initial accessibility and setting up the necessary foundation and architecture for additional content that hopefully, will eclipse the scope of the first game in a few years.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "XCUTE(me) is a vertical shoot’em up featuring sexy female characters for both the heroes and the villains. Players can choose from a collection of four different executer-class “XCUTE” fighter ships with their own different types of shooting pattern, piloted by four different cute female fighters.\r\nThe gameplay is simple and can be playable with mostly one finger, occasionally two. Hold the screen to continuously fire and lift your finger to change projectile colors. Avoid all projectiles at all costs.\r\nMatching the gun color to the enemy color will give more points, providing a sort of added challenge to the players instead of purely focusing on pure destruction. When the energy meter is full, two finger taps will release a powerful special move.\r\nI found the gameplay fun and entertaining especially when you’re just amped by the absolutely metal soundtrack that caught me off guard and stole the show. Superbly adding an intense and exhilarating vibe to the game.\r\nThe soundtrack and gameplay go hand-in-hand and creates a dazzling experience of bullet hell mayhem that is forgiving to the player. Despite all the carnage, I somehow was able to survive and stay alive many times. Your fighter’s hitboxes are teeny-tiny; it’s just a single dot in the center of the fighter. This allows you to squeeze and “clip” your fighter into the smallest of openings and come out completely unscathed.\r\nAll in all, XCUTE(me) shouldn’t take you more than half a day of playing to complete, but its replayability is highly dependent on how you like the gameplay and how you like to replay the five stages. At a reasonable price of $5, It’s not asking much for a try, especially for shoot 'em up aficionados.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Developed by Fantastico Studio and published by Digerati, Black Paradox is a retro style horizontal shoot'em up that features a beautiful pixel art, pumping electronic soundtrack, and fast-paced gameplay that will keep your fingers sweating. It is available on a multiple of platforms, but today we are focusing on the Mobile version.\r\nOne of the first things that stands out in Black Paradox is the amazing soundtrack that captures the essence of the 80s with its 8-bit sounding electro-techno music. In addition, the retro pixel art is amazing and visually appealing as well\r\nIn Black Paradox, you play as the titular bounty hunter named Black Paradox, who must eliminate the seven leaders of the criminal organization Hellraisers. You control a Delorean-turned-spaceship equipped with powerful weapons, flying through levels filled with a variety of enemies and obstacles, avoiding bullet-hell full of projectiles and patterns from both sides.\r\nThe game is difficult and requires the use of both hands to play. The left hand is used to move the ship and activate a special ability that calls for temporary backup, while the right hand is used to shoot and change weapons. Across levels, you can find and equip up to two weapons at a time, including boomerangs, shotguns, and rocket launchers.\r\nBlack Paradox is a rogue-lite as well, giving you both temporary upgrades inside runs and persistent upgrades purchasable using credits. The game so far is very interesting, the quality of the pumping electro soundtrack alone is worth trying it out. It is difficult and challenging, but the gameplay is simple and easy to learn.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4651917) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Pitstop in Purgatory is a visual novel / adventure game full of story and thought-provoking ideas. Originally made for PC in a surprising two-month timeframe, it is now available as well for Android.\r\nYou play as Astrid, a frustrated young actress who recently died. She wakes up and finds herself in the afterlife, but it’s not Heaven or Hell. It’s something close to a Purgatory, sothat’s what they call it for her. At the start, she doesn’t remember her death and is in a state of confusion.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Thought provoking story\r\n- Explores heavy and serious themes\r\n- Beautiful dreamy art-style\r\n## Cons\r\n- Unresponsive touch controls\r\nAstrid has to navigate her way through a strange and unfamiliar world. As Astrid progresses through the game, he learns more about the nature of purgatory and the reasons why she is there. The plot is simple yet very imaginative and mysterious that unfolds beautifully as you play it, and It keeps the player engaged from start to finish.\r\nAt the start, you are at a loss to what happened, even the cause of death of your character is not known. It stimulates your curiosity, naturally you’d want to know more about it and compels you to play and play.\r\nThe presentation of the game is in a visual novel style, with a beautiful art-style that is both loose and unstable-looking. The art-style fits perfectly with the theme of the game, as it feels messy and muddy, as if it was from a dream or a near-death experience. The visuals are complemented by a playful soundtrack that sets the mood for the game, although I feel that the background music doesn't exactly line up well with the themes explored in the game.\r\nYou can tell it was originally made for PCs and it shows. The touch controls have some accuracy issues due to how small the control buttons are in the UI. The font is kind of small and that doesn’t bode well for the lots of reading, there is no voiced dialogue, except for the occasional impactful and important lines which are voiced, and some grunts and laughs from the characters.\r\nIn the purgatory, you can interact with other souls and even befriend some of them, and it can lead to finding more about them, and their life on Earth. A modest romantic option is available for two of the characters, but it’s not really the main focus. Your main goal is to find your purpose and feel at peace.\r\nOne of the game's biggest strengths is its themes. The game explores some heavy and depressive themes related to death and the afterlife, but it balances this with a lighthearted tone that keeps the game from feeling too heavy or overwhelming. The ethical questions that the game poses are also thought-provoking and add to the overall depth of the story.\r\nWhile the story tells like a visual novel, it plays like a point-and-click adventure game, with items and very surface level puzzles and riddles present that are essential in advancing the dialogue, story, and progression as a whole. The puzzles and riddles add to the overall immersion of the game. They are not too difficult, but they require some creative thinking to solve. At its core, it is primarily a visual novel.\r\nPitstop in Purgatory is a captivating and unique game that explores themes of death and the afterlife through a well-written story and interesting characters, all presented in a fitting beautiful art-style.\r\nIt is a short but meaningful game that will take you around two hours of playtime to finish a regular playthrough. However, you are missing the full story that way. As the game features three different routes — not endings, routes — that you can take during the latter part of the playthroughs, leading to three widely different outcomes that are all worthy to experience. The game definitely didn’t overstay its welcome and is well paced throughout the playthroughs.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nAt four dollars, Pitstop in Purgatory is definitely a good deal considering the depth and thought-provoking nature of its story and overall experience. While the game may be short-lived, its impact can be profound and have far-reaching effects on the player. For the price, players are getting a rich and meaningful narrative experience that is well worth the cost.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4649426) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Kerbal Space Program 2 is now released in Early Access. Is it a decent follow-up to one of the greatest spacecraft physics simulation games of all time — Kerbal Space Program?",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "Kerbal Space Program 2 is now released in Early Access. Is it a decent follow-up to one of the greatest spacecraft physics simulation games of all time — Kerbal Space Program?\r\n## Pros\r\n- A highly educational game about real-life spacecraft physics\r\n- Highly accurate simulation of space orbits\r\n- A good foundation is laid for future content\r\n## Cons\r\n- Missing even the core features from the first game\r\n- All the added features like multiplayer are not yet present\r\n- No modding support yet\r\n- $50 for an Early Access without much starting content is too much\r\n## Is it a decent follow-up?\r\nThat question is a tall order. The first game, even while still in the Early Access stages, was already well received consistently up to its release and post-release. In addition, similar games have come out since the first game that improved this simulator genre a lot like Juno: New Origins (Formerly Simple Rockets 2).\r\nRealistically, I had mixed expectations for this game. For sure, it will be hard to top the original with its lifetime of updates and mod content readily available, especially with the changes with the developer and publisher. Unfortunately, my expectations were well placed, as Kerbal Space Program 2 — in it’s current state — is only but an empty shell compared to what the original game currently offers.\r\nFor genre newcomers, Kerbal Space Program 2, or KSP2, is essentially a space flight simulator that offers players the opportunity to design, engineer, build, and launch their own rockets, spacecraft, and planes as they attempt to explore the vast reaches of the fictional Kerbol System and beyond.\r\nPlayers control the Kerbals, an up and coming alien species living in the Kerbol System. They’re cute, quirky, clumsy, and funny looking green aliens that add a sense of humor and silliness to the game, providing us relief from the grim and dangerous nature of space travel.\r\nThis game is hard to learn, and hard to master. After all, players are learning real-life orbital mechanics and physics. The learning curve is so steep you might as well call it a cliff. Luckily, there are tutorials that can help the player, and it takes its sweet time unloading all these highly technical information to the players to ensure it is as comprehensible as it can be. If these still don’t work, then the experimentations and trial and error are all part of the game anyway, and players can learn from that too.\r\nThe graphics are pleasant, with higher resolution textures, more advanced lighting, particle effects, and atmospheric effects like clouds all helping create a realistic feel to match the simulator nature of the game.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nKerbal Space Program 2, like the first game, features in some degree a highly realistic physics engine, which accurately models the forces and effects of gravity, aerodynamics, and orbital mechanics. This means that players must carefully plan and execute their missions, taking into account factors such as weight distribution, atmospheric drag, fuel consumption, and gravitational effects from celestial bodies.\r\nThis realistic simulation creates a rewarding and engaging gameplay experience that challenges players to think creatively but at the same time critically, and learn about the real-life science of space travel. From designing and testing the spacecraft themselves, it can already take players countless hours of tinkering and experimentation. This is not even accounting the actual missions that players partake into which also takes a lot of time and effort, and this is where Kerbal Space Program 2 currently lacks: the content.\r\nHowever, what Kerbal Space Program 2 does well is the initial accessibility and setting up the necessary foundation and architecture for additional content that hopefully, will eclipse the scope of the first game after many years.\r\nFor the succeeding points, I’m going to heavily compare KSP2 to the first game, and see what has changed, what’s missing, and what’s promised.\r\n## Changes:\r\nFor starters, the game is more presentable now, even beginning with a cinematic introduction sequence to the game that adds a lot of flavor and appeal factor. In the first game,players really had to like and be able to understand the gameplay on their own in order to be hooked. Compared to now, animated tutorials and gameplay prompts are immediately present, with a helpful AI assistant called P.A.I.G.E. that guides players in grasping the highly steep learning curve of the game.\r\nKSP2 also now offers different difficulty settings that alter the gameplay: docking tolerances, reverts, quickloads, and communication protocols are all customizable. There are even toggle-able cheats for those looking for the ultimate sandbox experience.\r\nParts are now highly customizable, with some parts dynamic and adjustable in angles, and even color. The first game only had prefabricated parts and sizes to choose from. However, fuel tanks are still prefabricated and not dynamic which is disappointing.\r\n## Missing:\r\nThere is currently no Career and Science Mode, these modes offer a gamified and a progression-oriented experience that will encourage and motivate players and add more meaning and substance to their playthroughs. Right now, all that exists is a sandbox mode. Other missing features that were present in the first game are resource gathering, asteroids, and comets. Some aspects like first person cockpit view are also missing.\r\nOne of the biggest reasons why the first one was so successful was modding support, with the community providing a lot of heavy lifting for extending the longevity and versatility of the game, to the point that various former mods have eventually become vanilla features of the game.\r\nRegrettably, modding for KSP2 is currently unsupported. These missing features make KSP2 utterly inferior to the first game right now.\r\n## Promises:\r\nInterstellar Travel, Multiplayer, and Colonies. Players will now be able to travel to neighboring star systems, participate in large scale base building, and play with friends. Currently, none of these exist in KSP2, but they are promised in a future update. Ironically, many of these gameplay features are already somehow present in KSP1, via modding, but native support is almost always better!\r\n## Technical Performance:\r\nThe performance right now is extremely bad. I’m on a RTX 3080, 32GB RAM, and an i7-8700k and I am getting below 30 fps when flying simple crafts. Anything outdoor will absolutely cripple your frame rates for no good reason.\r\nWhile the graphics and visuals have improved a lot, I was expecting a relatively well performing game considering the first one was single-threaded and this one should have multi-threaded support by now.\r\n## The Price:\r\nWhen KSP1 launched on Steam Early Access back in 2013, it was for $23, discounted even more for earlier adopters. It launched in a similar state as KSP2 is right now, but at KSP2's $50 launch price, it sends a different message to the consumers and one that’s not positively received. It is too high for what it offers and makes supporting the game ironically harder.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nIt pains me to say this, but if you are looking for even the slightest enjoyable experience you could have with a space physics simulator that’s worth $50, I do not recommend buying Kerbal Space Program 2 at the moment. I would rather recommend the first game with its plethora of content and active modding community. If you are looking for a mobile counterpart that's also playable, you can try Juno: New Origins for a tenth of the price.\r\nOnly buy this if you want to actively support the development and have extra cash to burn. Note that a purchase of this title will mean you’re in it for the long haul, expect this game to be utterly inferior to the first game for a couple of, if not many, many years, and there are even no guarantees it can reach the end stages.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4652700) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "XCUTE(me) is a vertical scrolling bullet-hell shoot'em up game (AKA “shmups”), featuring cell-shaded graphics and anime-inspired female ecchi characters.\r\n## Pros\r\n- alluring cell-shaded characters\r\n- simple touch controls\r\n- metal soundtrack## Cons\r\n-The UI and the presentation felt underdeveloped\r\n-Game's content may not be suitable for all audiences\r\nThe game features four different executer-class “XCUTE” fighter ships, each piloted by a cute female fighter, and each with their own different types of shooting pattern.\r\nThese fighter ships are reverse engineered from enemy technology, from the mysterious (also cute and sexy) interdimensional beings called X.GHOSTS. These beings have conquered Earth in the far future and it's up to our heroines to  ̶u̶n̶d̶r̶e̶s̶s̶  defeat them and save the day.\r\nThe gameplay is simple and can be playable with mostly one finger, occasionally two. Hold the screen to continuously fire and lift your finger to change projectile colors. Avoid all projectiles at all costs. Matching the gun color to the enemy color will give more points, providing a sort of added challenge to the players instead of purely focusing on pure destruction. When the energy meter is full, two finger taps will release a powerful special move.\r\nThere are five stages with bosses to face at the end, these are the giant X.GHOSTS girl units that you have to  ̶u̶n̶d̶r̶e̶s̶s̶  defeat. Damaging them will slowly chip away their clothes, until they are in their undies (just ecchi, no nudity). There is a bit of replayability by way of looping the five stages after you beat these five without dying. Making it ten stages total with the true final boss at the end.\r\nXCUTE(me) is a messy bullet hell shooter, with lots of projectiles on screen producing a lot of clutter, it doesn’t help that your 1-2 fingers are also on it, potentially blocking some of the action on an already limited vertical screen space.\r\nStill, I found it fun and entertaining especially when you’re just amped by the absolutely metal soundtrack that caught me off guard and steals the show. Superbly adding an intense and exhilarating vibe to the game.\r\nThe soundtrack and gameplay go hand-in-hand and creates a dazzling experience of bullet hell mayhem that is forgiving to the player. Despite all the carnage, I somehow was able to survive and stay alive many times. Your fighter’s hitboxes are teeny-tiny; it’s just a single dot in the center of the fighter. This allows you to squeeze and “clip” your fighter into the smallest of openings and come out completely unscathed.\r\nAll in all, XCUTE(me) shouldn’t take you more than half a day of playing to complete, but its replayability is highly dependent on how you like the gameplay and how you like to replay the five stages. At a reasonable price of $5, It’s not asking much for a try, especially for shmups aficionados.\r\nGraphics\r\nIt’s not something that stands out, but the anime-inspired female ecchi characters and the cell-shaded graphics make the game visually appealing and entertaining. However, it is important to note that this game's content may not be suitable for all audiences.\r\nThe UI and the presentation felt underdeveloped and amateurish, with dull colors, fonts and sharp edges for the UI elements. Even the English localization is full of errors and mistranslations.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4649365) Originally posted on TapTap.",

You can either do it silently or face the wrath of endless cop raids while trying to steal and escape.\r\nThe game features a variety of missions that require players to work together to steal valuable items, rob banks, and fight off law enforcement. You first have to spend money to be able to start Heists, and upon successfully completing it, you earn money and rewards.\r\nThere is a high level of customization that players can achieve.

This allows players to tailor their characters to their preferred play style and adds an extra layer of depth to the game.\r\nAfter completing a heist, players are rewarded with cash and experience points. These rewards can be used to purchase new weapons and equipment, unlock new skills and abilities, and upgrade existing gear.\r\nThe gameplay loop of PAYDAY: Crime War involves a mix of strategic planning, fast-paced action, and cooperative teamwork. Players must work together to overcome obstacles and complete objectives while fending off waves of enemies and collecting rewards along the way. This cycle is continued over and over again, leading to more powerful gear and more difficult heists.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4649779) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Epic Age is a strategy / civilization management game set in the middle ages, but pools over heroes and civilizations from all across history in an ultimate strategy showdown that features heroes such as Leonidas, Spartacus, Alexander the Great; and civilizations like Persians, Egyptians, Romans, and many more\r\nEpic Age is played on a hexagonal grid, with the player's civilization starting with a single city and one battle group called “squads”. From there, the player must build up their kingdom’s infrastructure, expand their territory, and advance their technologies and culture to become a dominant power. The various structures and buildings take different amounts of real-world time to construct and upgrade.\r\nPlayers can slowly expand their territory by conquering neighboring hex tiles, one by one. Some tiles will be more powerful than your current soldiers can handle, so you have to carefully pick which tiles to conquer first, while upgrading your troops, city, and technology.\r\nPlayers typically perform a set of actions or tasks like upgrades, that require a certain amount of time to complete. Once completed, the player must wait a certain amount of real-life time before being able to perform an action again. This wait time can range from a few seconds to several minutes or even hours, depending on the stage of your progression.\r\nEpic Age's real-world waiting time element and daily login bonuses provide a sense of progression even when not actively playing, and the quest-based system acts as a player tutorial to guide players in their progression.\r\nOne of the main highlights of Epic Age is the Hero Collecting aspect that functions like a Deck building game, allowing players to recruit over a hundred historical figures like Joan of Arc or Spartacus with differing tiers and rarities. Players can assign them to lead armies, do politics, and more, providing extra bonuses into what they do depending on their attributes. This adds another layer of strategy to the game and encourages players to collect and upgrade their heroes.\r\nLater on, Players will encounter other player settlements on the online world map and can battle it out, players can also join guilds to do politics and form alliances with other players.\r\nThe graphics are just amazing for strategy mobile game standards, especially when the heroes are displayed on the screen, with highly detailed character models that beats even many full-pledged PC and Console titles in the level of detail.\r\nAt the onset, Epic Age is a highly engaging and addicting mobile strategy game that offers a variety of gameplay elements: hero collecting, empire management, politics, tactical warfare, and role playing — to the point of being too overwhelming at times — but it can keep players entertained and challenged on a daily basis.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4650600) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The ship automatically fires at enemies, and the player must avoid the incoming projectiles cluttering the map.\r\nThe player ship has a special move called \"Reversal,\" which is activated by tapping with two fingers. This move temporarily sends back all projectiles to the enemies, allowing players to clear the screen and get a brief moment of respite, helpful when overwhelmed by projectiles and enemies.\r\nAs players progress through the run, they collect points and powerups spawned by eliminated enemies. These powerups upgrade the player's ship's weapons, including the spray pattern and mechanics, and give them temporary abilities like an EMP or a protective shield.\r\nPlayers start with three lives, and there is no opportunity to replenish them during a run. The goal of the game is to beat the top score, with each run being endless.\r\nZeroVector features four different bosses, each with their own attack patterns and behavior. Players must use their skills and upgrades to defeat these bosses and progress through the game.\r\nZeroVector uses a minimalist approach to its graphics, with simple geometric wireframe shapes and bright neon colors. The game's player ship, enemies, and bosses are all made up of simple shapes such as squares, triangles, and circles. The animation is super fluid and the visual effects are mesmerizing especially when ships blow up and effects are all over the screen.\r\nZeroVector is a simple shoot’em up game that you will either like or not like within the first 10 minutes. It’s free so anyone can try it. Is it worth a try? If you love shoot ’em up games, It’s a yes for me.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4649537) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe is a remake and an enhanced edition of the original Wii title from 12 years ago. It takes the exact same story and gameplay, but revamps the graphics to modern standards, and it is beautiful.\r\nThe game takes players on a 2.5D platformer adventure through a colorful and whimsical world. The game's updated graphics bring Kirby's world to life like never before, with vibrant colors and detailed environments that create an immersive experience for players. It doesn’t matter if you are playing on an OLED Switch or the OG one, the colors are amazing.\r\nIn Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, players control Kirby as he embarks on a journey to collect five scattered pieces and Energy Spheres of a crashed spaceship so he can return a stranded alien back to his home planet, with the help of three other characters - Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Waddle Dee, playable up to four players in cooperative mode.\r\nThe game's core gameplay is similar to previous Kirby games, with players controlling Kirby as he inhales enemies to gain their abilities (called copy-abilities) and progresses through levels by solving puzzles and defeating bosses.\r\nThis core gameplay mechanic is immensely satisfying, with over 25 copy abilities to try out and experiment with. Each of these delightfully animated abilities have their own movesets and effects, keeping the gameplay fresh all the time throughout the campaign, and even throughout re-plays.\r\nCompared to the original game, not only the graphics have been significantly updated, but many gameplay elements and changes have been added as well. Three new copy abilities have been added, and some of the existing ones have been slightly reworked to reflect changes done in newer games.\r\nAdditionally, significantly more sub-games (minigames) are now available to play with friends, complete with a new charming amusement park section to house these sub-games instead of a main-menu selection only. All of which provide fun and engaging diversions from the main story, and is almost a game on its own, completely playable with up to four players.\r\nLastly, after the main campaign, there is a bonus game mode that features another main character in which I am not going to spoil. Again, it is playable with up to four players.\r\nUnfortunately, while there are online social and sharing features integrated into the game, there is no option for online-play, and thus, the 4-player multiplayer aspect is only local. A 4-player online co-op would have been a welcome feature.\r\nThe game’s main campaign is easily beatable under 10 hours, but with a plethora of sub-games and fun overall co-op gameplay, it's not exactly hard to replay this game again and accumulate countless hours of fun.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4649461) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The added Deluxe in the title does not really do the game’s title justice, as Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe is a full-on remake of the original game, which was released for the Wii console back in 2011.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Accessible difficulty options, great for all ages\r\n- A fun platforming adventure\r\n- Local coop play up to 4 players\r\n- A plethora of fun coop minigames\r\n## Cons\r\n- No online coop play\r\n## Kirby’s re-Return\r\nKirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe is a remake and enhanced edition of the original Wii title from 12 years ago. It takes the exact same story and gameplay, but revamps the graphics to modern standards, and it is beautiful.\r\nThe game takes players on a 2.5D adventure through a colorful and whimsical platforming world. The game's updated graphics bring Kirby's world to life like never before, with vibrant colors and detailed environments that create an immersive experience for players. It doesn’t matter if you are playing on an OLED Switch or the OG one, the colors are amazing.\r\n## Credits to GameXplain's youtube channel for the comparison\r\nThe differences not only lies in the upgraded graphical capabilities of the Switch, but also expresses a slight change in art-style, coming from a full 3D graphics to a more sharper cell-shaded design filled with more detail and life.\r\nIn Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, players control Kirby as he embarks on a journey to collect five scattered pieces and Energy Spheres of a crashed spaceship so he can return a stranded alien back to his home planet, with the help of three other characters - Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Waddle Dee, playable up to four players in cooperative mode.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay manages to strike a balance between accessibility and challenge. The game's controls are intuitive, and the premise overall is lighthearted and cheerful, making it easy for players of all ages and skill levels to pick up and play. At the same time, the levels are designed to be challenging enough to keep players engaged and entertained. They are also designed with co-op in mind, filled with opportunities for teamwork and coordination.\r\nThe game's core gameplay is similar to previous Kirby games, with players controlling Kirby as he inhales enemies to gain their abilities (called copy-abilities) and progresses through levels by solving puzzles and defeating bosses.\r\nThis core gameplay mechanic is immensely satisfying, with over 25 copy abilities to try out and experiment with. Each of these delightfully animated abilities have their own movesets and effects, keeping the gameplay fresh all the time throughout the campaign, and even throughout re-plays.\r\nThe level design is well-crafted and filled with creative obstacles and enemies. The levels are intricately designed to be fun to explore and offer plenty of secrets to discover for players who are willing to take their extra time to find collectibles such as Point Stars, Energy Spheres and Stamp Tickets. Most if not all of the bosses are returning from the game. The countless boss battles in particular, are one of the highlights of the game, with each one offering a unique challenge that requires quick reflexes and strategic thinking.\r\n## Differences from the original Wii version\r\nCompared to the original game, not only the graphics have been significantly updated, but many gameplay elements and changes have been added as well. Three new copy abilities have been added, and some of the existing ones have been slightly reworked to reflect changes done in newer games.\r\nThis version of the game includes several new copy abilities, such as Mecha, allowing you to control an offensive mechanized armor, and Sand, allowing you to control sands and perform attacks such as sandfists and dust devils, which add new ways for players to approach challenges and keep the gameplay fresh.\r\nThere is also an easier game mode called “Helper Magolor” which if toggled, will function as a guidance and offer additional help to the players by way of tossing potions, ability stars, or flat out saving Kirby from death.\r\nAdditionally, significantly more sub-games (minigames) are now available to play with friends, complete with a new charming amusement park section to house these sub-games instead of a menu selection only. All of which provide fun and engaging diversions from the main story, and is almost a game on its own, completely playable with up to four players.\r\nLastly, after the main campaign, there is a bonus game mode that features another main character in which I am not going to spoil. Again, it is playable with up to four players.\r\nThe game’s main campaign is easily beatable under 10 hours, but with a plethora of sub-games and fun overall co-op gameplay, it's not exactly hard to replay this game again and accumulate countless hours of fun.\r\n## Is the Full AAA price justified?\r\nFor a 12 year old game, I can say the full AAA price of $60 is justified for newcomers because it is a full-on remake with nicely updated graphics, art-style, with a plethora of gameplay elements and minigames added. For those just revisiting, it is still a highly considerable purchase that you can make anytime — there’s no point in waiting for a price drop, as Nintendo first-party titles do rarely go on sale.\r\nUnfortunately, while there are online social and sharing features integrated into the game, there is no option for online-play, and thus, the 4-player multiplayer aspect is only local. A 4-player online co-op would have been a welcome feature.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nOverall, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe is a platforming game that excels in its core mechanics, level design, coop play, and fun factor. It's a memorable and much recommended experience that is sure to delight lovers of the platforming genre; and the new graphics and added features such as the mini-games make it a worthwhile purchase for both newcomers and fans of the original game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4659130) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## Pros\r\n- Fun PvE heisting experience\r\n- Gun Customization options## Cons\r\n-performance and crashing issues\r\n-unresponsive controls and clunky shooting mechanics\r\nIn PAYDAY: Crime War, you are in a squad of bank robbers and you have to perform heists such as robbing banks or jewelry stores to progress throughout the game.\r\nFinally faithful to the OGs\r\nThe updated game features a gameplay formula similar to the PC and console versions, adapted into mobile form. This means that the game is free to play but includes microtransactions, real-life waiting times, gacha, and live service elements. While these features may be a turn-off for some players, they are common and widely accepted as norm in mobile games and may not impact the overall gameplay experience.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe game features a variety of missions that require players to work together to steal valuable items, rob banks, and fight off law enforcement. You first have to spend money to be able to start Heists, and upon successfully completing it, you earn money and rewards.\r\nThroughout the mission, players must work together to complete a variety of objectives, such as stealing valuables, drilling into Vaults, or hacking into security systems. These objectives are often timed and require players to work quickly and efficiently.\r\nThere is a high level of customization that players can achieve. Players can choose from a variety of weapons and equipment, and they can also customize their gear with attachments as they progress through the game. This allows players to tailor their characters to their preferred play style and adds an extra layer of depth to the game.\r\nStill in open beta so there’s not much players at the moment, so most of my gameplay experience has been entirely with bot companions. They are mostly competent for the most part, helping you in shootouts and properly reviving you when downed.\r\nAfter completing a heist, players are rewarded with cash and experience points. These rewards can be used to purchase new weapons and equipment, unlock new skills and abilities, and upgrade existing gear.\r\nThe gameplay loop of PAYDAY: Crime War involves a mix of strategic planning, fast-paced action, and cooperative teamwork. Players must work together to overcome obstacles and complete objectives while fending off waves of enemies and collecting rewards along the way. This cycle is continued over and over again, leading to more powerful gear and more difficult heists.\r\nTechnical Performance\r\nThe performance is still being worked out, and it does not perform well currently even on high end devices. I tested this on an iPhone 13, and the game still recommended a low setting option. Even after setting it to a 60fps game mode, the game still struggles to maintain the target 60 FPS and will drop to 30 at times. I also experienced multiple crashes and server issues while trying this game out.\r\nWhile the controls are customizable and the HUD elements can be repositioned, the overall gunplay feels a bit unresponsive, which is a shame because it comprises majority of the gameplay. The shooting is clunky and moving feels floaty.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4659193) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Black Paradox is a retro-styled horizontal scrolling rogue-lite shoot 'em up that brings back the nostalgia of the arcade games from the 80s and 90s.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Pumping electronic soundtrack\r\n- Stunning pixel art\r\n- Fun and challenging rogue-lite gameplay## Cons\r\n-Touch controls are a little unresponsive\r\nDeveloped by Fantastico Studio and published by Digerati, this game features beautiful a pixel art, pumping electronic soundtrack, and fast-paced gameplay that will keep your fingers sweating. It is available on a multiple of platforms, but this Full Review is focusing on the Mobile version only.\r\nThe soundtrack is the best thing about this game\r\nOne of the first things that stands out in Black Paradox is the amazing soundtrack that captures the essence of the 80s with its 8-bit sounding electro-techno music.\r\nIn addition, the retro pixel art is amazing and visually appealing with even a matching CRT filter included, even from the intricately animated explosion sprites to the cyberpunk looking Hellraisers bosses. The cosmic space backgrounds are detailed and immersive, with various elements that give off a lot of atmosphere, or lack thereof since it's in… outer space.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nIn Black Paradox, you play as the titular bounty hunter named Black Paradox, who must eliminate the seven leaders of the criminal organization Hellraisers. You control a Delorean-turned-spaceship equipped with powerful weapons, flying through levels filled with enemies and obstacles.\r\nThe enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and they shoot different types of bullets, creating a bullet-hell experience that requires you to dodge and weave through the onslaught of projectiles.\r\nThe game is difficult and requires the use of both hands to play. The left hand is used to move the ship and activate a special ability, while the right hand is used to shoot and change weapons. Across levels, you can find and equip up to two weapons at a time, including boomerangs, shotguns, and rocket launchers.\r\nThe special ability activated by double tapping the left hand side of the screen calls for a backup with a random weapon that will help you especially when overwhelmed or in boss fights.\r\nAt the end of each level, you are presented with two upgrade options that allow you to improve your ship's stats or add modifiers that can change the game's behavior. These upgrades are essential to surviving the later levels and boss battles, and they can dramatically alter the way you play the game. Persistent upgrades come in the form of spaceship/car modifications that are purchasable using credits accumulated in runs.\r\nThe game is short, even with the high degree of difficulty. It is beatable in a day or two, especially once you’ve accumulated lots of cash to spend on persistent upgrade and are familiar with the enemy pattern and behavior.\r\nFeature parity with the PC / console versions\r\nOne of the mobile version’s few drawbacks is the lack of a multiplayer mode. The PC and console versions of the game offer a 2-player co-op mode, but this feature is not available in the mobile version.\r\nAdditionally, the controls are not exactly responsive for the touchscreen, especially for right-handed players. The controls feel a bit unresponsive and there is a bit of input lag. No amount of sensitivity adjustment was able to fix it on my end. All of this combined results in an imprecise control scheme that will lead you to unnecessary damage, significantly increasing the difficulty. You are also prone to accidentally activate the special button because of the simplistic double-tap activation.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4663625) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Hero collecting, empire management, politics, tactical warfare, and role playing, Epic Age is all of these things combined, and it's playable on Mobile devices!\r\n## Pros\r\n- Addicting civilization building gameplay\r\n- Fun hero collecting mechanic\r\n- Amazingly detailed graphics## Cons\r\n-Requires a lot of real-world waiting\r\n-Heavy pay to win mechanics\r\nEpic Age is a strategy / civilization management game set in the middle ages, but pools over heroes and civilizations from all across history in an ultimate strategy showdown that features heroes such as Leonidas, Spartacus, Alexander the Great; and civilizations like Persians, Egyptians, Romans, and many more.\r\nThe basic gist of the game is that it plays similarly to strategy games like Civilization and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, infused with mobile game elements taken from Clash of Clans and Lords Mobile.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nEpic Age is played on a hexagonal grid, with the player's civilization starting with a single city and one battle group called “squads”. From there, the player must build up their kingdom’s infrastructure, expand their territory, and advance their technologies and culture to become a dominant power. The various structures and buildings take different amounts of real-world time to construct and upgrade.\r\nPlayers start-off with a group of people who just escaped their land destroyed by a volcanic eruption. Players choose their starting location throughout the expansive online world map and build a settlement from there.\r\nPlayers can slowly expand their territory by conquering neighboring hex tiles, one by one. Some tiles will be more powerful than your current soldiers can handle, so you have to carefully pick which tiles to conquer first, while upgrading your troops, city, and technology.\r\nTroops can be in either of the five available types: Infantry, Archer, Cavalry, Spearman and Artillery. Providing a five-way rock-paper-scissors dynamic of strengths and weaknesses to battles. Players can use this to their advantage when battling other armies.\r\nEach tile will have different resources and benefits it can bring to your civilization, and requires clicking on each in order to farm these resources. Certain resources required for building and upgrading structures take real-world time to produce, further adding to the waiting element. This also entices players to check in once in a while or even play everyday. Even going as far as giving daily login bonuses to players.\r\nThis game takes a lot of real-world time\r\nPlayers typically perform a set of actions or tasks like upgrades, that require a certain amount of time to complete. Once completed, the player must wait a certain amount of real-life time before being able to perform an action again. This wait time can range from a few seconds to several minutes or even hours, depending on the stage of your progression.\r\nThere are too many things going on\r\nIt’s a highly micromanagement based game, one that entices players to try and click every nook and cranny of the UI element. Its concepts are overwhelming at first, but you don’t need to know about everything to start playing and enjoying it. There’s also a quest based system that sort of functions like a tutorial to guide players in their progression, offering bonuses as well upon completion; However they can always deviate from these quests and continue on their own.\r\nEpic Age's real-world waiting time element and daily login bonuses provide a sense of progression even when not actively playing, and the quest-based system acts as a player tutorial to guide players in their progression.\r\nAfter a while, players can choose to base their civilization on a selection of various real-world historical civilization profiles, like Romans, Vikings, Chinese, Japanese, and many more.\r\nGotta collect them all!\r\nOne of the main highlights of Epic Age is the Hero Collecting aspect that functions like a Deck building game, allowing players to recruit over a hundred historical figures like Joan of Arc or Spartacus with differing tiers and rarities.\r\nPlayers can assign them to lead armies, do politics, and more, providing extra bonuses into what they do depending on their attributes. This adds another layer of strategy to the game and encourages players to collect and upgrade their heroes.\r\nLater on, Players will encounter other player settlements on the online world map and can battle it out, players can also join guilds to do politics and form alliances with other players.\r\nImpressive graphics\r\nThe graphics are just amazing for strategy mobile game standards, especially when the heroes are displayed on the screen, with highly detailed character models that beats even many full-pledged PC and Console titles in the level of detail.\r\nBeing a free-to-play game, Epic Age is littered with microtransactions in every corner. From skipping waiting to brute force unlocking new heroes, a microtransaction option is available. This pay-to-win aspect does not bode well to the game’s balance between paying and non-paying players. However, this is a non-issue for someone who’s just looking to patiently enjoy a game non-competitively and players can definitely play this without ever spending a dime.\r\nThe game's combination of popular strategy and deck building game elements plus its unique features make it a standout in the mobile strategy genre. If you're a fan of live-service mobile strategy games and are looking for a new game to sink your teeth into, then Epic Age is definitely worth a try with its free-to-play nature.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4663547) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Phantom Brigade is turn-based tactical RPG puts players in charge of the Phantom Brigade, a band of mech pilots trying to liberate its land from its oppressive invaders.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Innovative combat system\r\n- Addicting progression\r\n- High degree of customization\r\n- Open-ended campaign\r\n## Cons\r\n- UI needs a bit of work\r\nSet in a dystopian future, the game puts players in the shoes of a team of customizable mech pilots fighting against a powerful military. This team is the titular Phantom Brigade.\r\n## Five seconds at a time\r\nAt the start of the game, the team have obtained a secret prototype weapon that lets them see briefly into the future, 5 seconds at a time. This is a game changer to both the characters in the story and to the players, providing an innovative tactical combat system that I have literally never seen before, and it just works.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nPhantom Brigade is turn-based, but it is also real-time, combining the best of both worlds. The tactical aspect of turn-based combat is mixed with the cinematic and high octane appeal of real-time battles. The overall feel of the gameplay, despite being a mixed strategy genre, feels VERY similar to the modern XCOM games.\r\n## The combat is cinematic and action packed\r\nThe game's combat mechanics are just simply addicting. The battles take place on a grid-based map, and the almost always out-numbered players must carefully maneuver their mechs to outmaneuver their opponents and gain the upper hand by way of smartly leveraging each of the units strengths and abilities, as well as the environment, to their advantage.\r\nLong range mechs can support from the back, on elevated ground, sniping key points of interest like power generators or alarm towers, while melee-based mechs can leverage their high close quarters damage and heavily damage multiple enemies with one sweep ambush.\r\nThe mechs also interact and behave way more than I expected, they can fall down, collide with each other, get dismembered, and suffer friendly fire; all depending on the environmental circumstances. Attacks need to be managed, because there is also a possibility of overheating, adding an additional layer of choice for the player to make a critical decision between pushing their Mechs to the absolute limit performing an important action; or to be careful, avoiding overheats which can cripple the Mech.\r\n## Innovative tactical combat system\r\nThanks to the prototype tech, the Phantom Brigade can peer into the future five seconds at a time, able to predict and see enemy movements mapped in this “timeline system.”\r\nAccordingly, every turn consists of planning out moves in a five-second span, running, attacking, and using abilities are all mapped in a timeline system as if you’re editing a video and splicing commands in instead of clips. After you’re done, clicking Execute will play these moves out in a real-time manner, resulting in some intense cinematic-style action-packed moments. In this game, you will be spending 30 minutes of tactical decision making for 30 seconds of real-time engagement.\r\nThis phenomenal system adds an entirely never seen before strategy and depth to the game, requiring players to think several moves ahead and anticipate their opponents' actions. Clearly differentiating itself from traditional turn-based chess-like games like Front Mission and real-time pausable tactics games like Company of Heroes.\r\n## Level Design\r\nThe battlefield is fully destructible and is highly dynamic — both visually and mechanically. Buildings and structures can provide cover, but can be destroyed and also penetrated by powerful weapons.\r\nSeeing beam weapons piercing through multiple buildings to hit a target across town is just mind-blowingly spectacular. Although, as much as possible, destruction should be minimal for civilian territories. While there are also points of interest in the map that need to be destroyed like Alarm towers or Power Generators, you also need to protect key civilian buildings and avoid damage to them.\r\n## Graphics\r\nThe graphics are simplistic, some older games have looked better, but they still pack a lot of detail and polish look into it, especially with the clean and pristine vivid looking Mechs and environments. They have done an amazing job with the lightning system, as well as the visual effects, especially when it comes to the destructible environment, explosions, and particle effects.\r\n## The Mechs\r\nPlayers can build and customize their own mechs, choosing from a wide range of weapons, armor, and other upgrades. This allows players to tailor their lineup and loadout to their specific playstyle, whether they prefer long-range snipers, medium ranged assault mechs, or up-close brawlers. The customization options are deep and varied, and experimenting with different builds is a lot of fun, especially when the game starts to settle.\r\nPhantom Brigade takes a while to settle because there’s so much going on, especially with the various gameplay elements. The timeline system is also a lot confusing to use at the start, even while slowly going through the tutorial section. However, once you get the feel of how it controls, it becomes a non-issue after the first hour or so.\r\n## Campaign\r\nIn the players’ campaign to liberate their homeland, there is an Overworld element that functions like a pausable real-time grand strategy game with a fast forward option where you take over points of interest in the map, taking you to countless battle instances. You roam with your brigade throughout the massive landscape across 30 provinces to take and involve 4 enemy factions. There are also more than 70 unique narrative events like defending locations, rescues, and assassination missions.\r\nSince the Phantom Brigade is just a small guerilla group, you cannot fully take over towns slowly one by one like a traditional grand strategy. You have to inspire the people of the province to instigate a province-wide revolution by way of destabilization before claiming the whole region. This gives a proper game mechanic when it comes to guerilla tactics.\r\nEntering new hostile territory will prove to be a challenge, as the longer you stay in your enemy regions to destabilize them, the harder the battles become. You can “reset” this by temporarily retreating to a friendly territory, and at the same time, gather your breath and take this time to customize your mech line-up.\r\n## Missions and Progression\r\nBefore a battle or a mission, Phantom Brigade gives you an outlook of the map, possible enemy locations and compositions; and customization of your squad/mech line-up.\r\nAfter a mission, you get debrief with rewards and loot, especially from fallen enemies and allies. You get to recover their parts with the possibility of repurposing these parts into your mechs. See a cool sniper-rifle held by an enemy you just killed? It will appear at the Debrief. However, there is a limit on which items you can recover or dismantle.\r\n## Technical Performance:\r\nPhantom Brigade is optimized accordingly, bordering at around 60 fps in battles at a 5440x1440 resolution, using an RTX 3080, i7-8700k, 32GB RAM. It also properly supports ultrawide resolutions and still retains a centered UI which is a great QOL feature for ultrawide users. UI scaling options, sleek HUD, and a clean user interface makes for a good user experience to accentuate the already addicting gameplay.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nWith its innovative combat, engaging campaign, and deep customization options, Phantom Brigade is an exceptional Mecha strategy game that's sure to keep players hooked for hours. This is definitely worth the price if you are a fan of Tactical Mech genre. A step in the right direction in the evolution of the genre.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4680069) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Destiny 2: Lightfall comes with a new storyline, a new playable area, and refined game mechanics to the long-standing popular MMORPG FPS game.\r\nFor the uninitiated, the base game - Destiny 2, is a free-to-play MMORPG FPS game where players take on the role of a Guardian, a protector of Earth's last city, and engage in various activities such as story missions, strikes, raids, and PvP battles.\r\nThe game's overarching premise involves defending the solar system against various threats, including hostile alien races and otherworldly forces. The entire premise takes form as a sci-fi story mixed with fantasy elements.\r\nWith the new expansion, The planet Neptune is added as a whole new destination for players to explore and continues the same visually impressive graphics with its neon-lit cyberpunk looking secret city of Neomuna located on Neptune.\r\nDespite being the fifth major expansion to a second game in the series, You don’t need to have played Destiny 1, or have bought any expansions if you want to dive into Destiny 2: Lightfall. The game expansion is standalone and can stand on its own as both a welcoming experience for newcomers and an expansion to existing players. However, it's recommended to play through the base game Destiny 2 first.\r\nThe expansion also introduces three new subclasses, new exotic weapons and armor, and increases the difficulty of basic activities, while decreasing ability cooldowns.  Further refining the content you can experience in Destiny 2.\r\nThe added new campaign for Lightfall is quite short. Coming in from the Witch Queen expansion, I find it a bit underwhelming and there isn’t enough stakes for the story nor enough explanation given to the player to care or to be amazed.\r\nSo far, Destiny 2: Lightfall adds further quality content to an already expansive MMORPG FPS game, however I'm not quite sure if the $50 asking price is worth it for these additional content, considering the base game is already free-to-play. Still, for newcomers, this seems like a good time to try out Destiny 2.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4679875) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Stranded on a hostile alien planet, crew is missing, you need to survive in this third person sci-fi shooter game - Scars Above.\r\nThe entire gameplay premise of Scars Above reminds me of Returnal: alone, stranded on a strange alien world, and you have to survive amongst hostile alien creatures while uncovering the mystery behind it all. The comparisons end there, as the gameplay and story is vastly different.\r\nThe gameplay is a grounded third person sci-fi shooter and overall feels like a great shooter from the PS3/X360 era. The gunplay is solid, the hits are weighty and the enemies are varied enough to be a formidable challenge that’s going to make you work. Even the boss fights are creatively well-made and never felt like a chore to beat despite being more difficult than other shooters. There are light RPG elements with include leveling up and unlocking new perks, weapon upgrades that slowly improves your gear, but nothing really groundbreaking.\r\nMelee combat on the other hand is more annoying than useful, with its stiff animation and janky collision system, constantly getting in your way, hitting you or blocking your way even if you aren’t really touching against each other. You can just forget it exists.\r\nThe world is alien and natural looking at the same time, rocky regions with lush flora that looks otherworldly infested with alien biomaterial, filled with both harmless and dangerous faunas alike that you need to survive in using your trusty tools and equipment. It is a semi-open world, with different mini open world zones divided into an overall linear progression.\r\nThe game is rich in lore and storytelling, immediately evident with the introduction sequence, interactive objects, and background news reports full of natural plot exposition. The mystery is nicely balanced with the exposition, giving you enough info to make sense of the on-going story but at the same time more questions are coming into the equation. The cinematic presentation felt a bit janky, especially with the funny facial expressions.\r\nSaving and dying is basically the same thing, it places you at that last save point and refreshes all enemies in the area, as well as your health and ammos. Basically what the game tells you is that don’t spam saves or you’ll constantly respawn all enemies. Only save when entering new areas. This is a novel mechanic that is neither rogue-lite, save-based, nor checkpoint based.\r\nOther than the janky cutscene movements, the voice acting, presentation, and graphics is actually of good quality and can pass as an AAA game. Even the in-game animations aren’t really that bad. With its mid-tier price of $40, this actually looks like a solid game to try if you like single-player third-person shooters.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4689344) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Scars Above is a new third person sci-fi shooter that puts players in the shoes of Kara, and a scientist who’s part of a team tasked to investigate a mysterious alien structure that randomly appeared in Earth’s orbit.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Creative and fun gameplay mechanics\r\n- Challenging and interesting use of enemies\r\n- Surprisingly good story## Cons\r\n-Very janky cinematic presentation\r\n-Awful level design\r\nSuddenly, everything blacks out, and you are stranded on an alien planet, your crew is missing, and you have nothing except questions and your trusty science-y brain to survive.\r\nFunny faces\r\nScars Above gives us a somewhat mixed-feeling introduction with its janky and funny looking facial and body animations that will remind you of Mass Effect Andromeda’s shaky launch.\r\nThe story is immediately gripping from the start\r\nIn some ways, it really feels like Mass Effect, especially in the introduction sequence where you are introduced to the spaceship and are roaming about the premises, the background music sounds like Mass Effect too. Surprisingly, despite the janky presentation, the premise and story is surprisingly gripping and well-written.\r\nThe game is rich in lore and storytelling, immediately evident with the introduction sequence, interactive objects, and background news reports full of natural plot exposition. The mystery is nicely balanced with the exposition, giving you enough info to make sense of the on-going story but at the same time more questions are coming into the equation.\r\nThis trend continues throughout the game, the levels scattered with bits of information and audio logs further explaining the story and your eventually missing crew members. One minor gripe is that you cannot play audio logs in the background and have to unnecessarily stay at the menus to listen.\r\nOther than the janky cutscene movements, the voice acting, presentation, and graphics is actually of good quality and can pass as an AAA game. Even the in-game animations aren’t really that bad.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe entire gameplay premise reminds me of Returnal: alone, stranded on a strange alien world, and you have to survive amongst hostile alien animals while uncovering the mystery behind it all. The comparisons end there, as the gameplay and story is vastly different.\r\nScars Above encourages thorough exploration and investigation to find out more about the story. It involves forensic-like mechanics of scanning around the area, finding evidence, and sometimes recreating what happened at the scene  ̶o̶f̶ ̶c̶r̶i̶m̶e̶.  The story going in tandem with the exploration mechanics go well with each other, with the players being motivated to investigate, driving the gameplay forward.\r\nThe main character is lost, that does not mean that players should be too\r\nHowever it is also its own detriment, as the exploration does not hold your hand even in the slightest bit and sometimes leaves the player wandering for far too long. Even with these drawn out segments, the game is relatively short, beatable under 10 hours. A compressed game focusing entirely on the action would have been better, while also cutting the expected time to beat by a few more hours.\r\nFun Gunplay Mechanics\r\nThe gunplay is grounded and overall feels like a great shooter from the PS3/X360 era, which again will get us back to the Mass Effect comparison. The gunplay is solid, the hits are weighty and the enemies are varied enough to be a formidable challenge that’s going to make you work.\r\nMelee combat on the other hand is more annoying than useful, with its stiff animation and janky collision system, constantly getting in your way, hitting you or blocking your way even if you aren’t really touching against each other.\r\nScars Above offers four elemental guns to use, each with their own advantages and disadvantages to enemies and environmental obstacles — Similar to Starlord’s Elemental Gun from Guardians of the Galaxy. They can also interact with the environment and with each other, creating for some fascinating combos like freezing your enemy before hitting them with lightning, or luring them over water to electrocute them.\r\nBeautiful, but flawed\r\nThe world is alien and natural looking at the same time, rocky regions with lush flora that looks otherworldly infested with alien biomaterial, filled with both harmless and dangerous faunas alike that you need to survive in using your trusty tools and equipment. It is a semi-open world, with different mini open world zones divided into an overall linear progression.\r\nDespite the beauty of it all, the level design is awful: constant back and forths, inadequate hints to progress, and hard to memorize and recognize pathways and areas. Except for the incessant use of jumpscares with enemies jumping out of swamps, the enemy placement is largely predictable when it comes to spawns. Open areas will always mean there is a boss fight coming.\r\nCreative boss fights\r\nSpeaking of boss fights, they gave me flashbacks of playing Dark Souls with the difficulty level but honestly, they’re not just bullet sponge enemies that you’d have to keep dodging away from until they’re dead. It is much more than that with its interesting and challenging fights that require reflexes and creative use of your different elemental abilities and gadgets. Some will require you to switch weapons mid-game because of vulnerabilities, or maybe to counter its attacks.\r\nSaving and dying is basically the same thing, it places you at that last save point and refreshes all enemies in the area, as well as your health and ammos. Basically what the game tells you is that don’t spam saves or you’ll constantly respawn all enemies. Only save when entering new areas. This is a novel mechanic that is neither rogue-lite, save-based, nor checkpoint based.\r\nLight RPG Mechanics\r\nAn unfortunate design decision but leveling up is heavily tied to the exploration and story progression only. Only by defeating bosses you will gain exp, while exploring every corner of the different levels will also grant you bonus exp to level up. Leveling up will allow you to choose perks for your character, it adds a minor RPG flavor to the game.\r\nCool meaningful weapon upgrades along the way are also obtainable in the map that slowly improves how the weapon functions. As well as gadgets like grenades. Providing small amounts of refreshments and buffs to the player as they progress to keep things fresh.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4695111) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Limbus Company is a free-to-play turn-based RPG game with a focus on storytelling, available for Mobile and PC platforms.\r\nThe main character is an amnesiac named Dante, his head is a burning clock for some reason, and he encounters this trusty mystical crew called the Sinners that follows his lead. He sort of serves as a coach / manager for this team, but he has no damn idea why anyway, conveniently sharing the same confusion he has with the players. The game is voiced in the Korean language but thankfully there are English subtitles. All I can think of is that the premise is a darker, more twisted 2D version of a Persona game.\r\nThis free-to-play game packs more story that I had anticipated, even more so than many full-pledge PC and console games. The game’s introduction hits like a bus when it comes to the exposition to the plot, showering you with tons of text ridden panels explaining the lore, and introducing you to more than 10 anime-like characters — inspired by real-world literature — in your first 15 minutes of play.\r\nThe battles are simplistic mechanically, just as simple as drawing a line to form a chain of attack commands for the whole team at once. Combos are done by chaining similarly colored moves and abilities to each other. Nevertheless, the presentation of the combat is visually stunning and action-packed.\r\nThe animations are cool and felt like anime characters duking it out with over-the-top stylish slashes and gory dismemberments. This system overall feels like a three-match game in disguise that ranks color combos and associations above everything else.\r\nThe whole game comprises a linear progression system through various levels inside chapters, back and forth-ing between visual novel-esque cutscenes that advance the story, or battles that you have to complete. The end of the chapters culminates in a mini dungeon-crawler experience that presents the players with more battles to conquer.\r\nThere is a time-currency aspect that limits your ability to enter battles, and you have to wait out real-world time in order to replenish this currency. However during the first few bits of the game, I’ve had more than plenty of currency to play continuously without it being a show-stopper.\r\nOf course, in time, this will probably be a huge limiting factor in the later parts of the story. There are gacha elements, but they mostly serve as additional flavor to the characters and not really a soft requirement in order to progress, at least for the early parts of the story.\r\nLimbus Company is a weird enough game with a matching weird story that compels me to play for some reason. Add to that the mesmerizing combat system and presentation; and it makes for a highly intriguing unique game that anyone with a mobile phone or PC can try at no cost.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4694954) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Destiny 2: Lightfall is the latest expansion for the popular online multiplayer RPG FPS Destiny 2, developed by Bungie (creators of Halo series).\r\n## Pros\r\n- New subclasses to play\r\n- New area and story campaign to experience## Cons\r\n-Uninspired campaign and level design\r\n-Questionable value at $50\r\nDestiny 2: Lightfall introduces a new storyline, playable area, and game mechanics to the existing game. Destiny 2: Lightfall takes place on Neptune, where players encounter new enemies, explore a neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape, and utilize new abilities and subclasses to complete challenges and acquire loot.\r\nThe expansion also introduces new exotic weapons and armor, and increases the difficulty of basic activities, while decreasing ability cooldowns. It is the fifth major expansion for Destiny 2, following Forsaken, Shadowkeep, Beyond Light, and The Witch Queen.\r\nAs a fan of the series and its developer, I was eager to dive into this new expansion and see what it had to offer.\r\nFor newcomers:\r\nI’m compelled to give out a short introduction for potential newcomers to the Destiny series, as this game is extremely packed with content and has been constantly updated, rebalanced, and even massively reworked for multiple times now throughout its five year life.\r\nFor starters, Destiny 2 is a free-to-play MMORPG FPS game where players take on the role of a Guardian, a protector of Earth's last city, and engage in various activities such as story missions, strikes, raids, and PvP battles. The game's overarching premise involves defending the solar system against various threats, including hostile alien races and otherworldly forces. The entire premise takes form as a sci-fi story mixed with fantasy elements.\r\nGameplay Analysis:\r\nAs an FPS shooter, Destiny 2 hits all the right notes when it comes to the gunplay, providing an amazing looter shooter experience that is undoubtedly best-in-class. The looting mechanics are also engaging and addicting.\r\nPlayers can find different tiers of randomized loot, ranging from common to exotic, with each tier offering more powerful and unique items. Players can obtain loot through various means, such as by defeating enemies, completing quests, and participating in events. This gameplay cycle of wanting to acquire better and more rare loot is highly addicting. This gameplay is continued and even more refined in Destiny 2: Lightfall.\r\nGraphics\r\nSpeaking of graphics, the series features some of the most beautiful and detailed environments I have ever seen in a game, even in its age. The locations are both breathtaking and haunting, and they really capture the essence of the game's fantasy, sci-fi universe. From the rusted ruins of abandoned spaceships to the towering, futuristic cities, every inch of the world is visually stunning. It is constantly being updated with new locations.\r\nWith the new expansion, Neptune is a whole new destination for players to explore and continues the same visually impressive graphics with its neon-lit cyberpunk looking secret city of Neomuna located on Neptune.\r\nDo I need to have played Destiny 1 or 2’s expansions?\r\nThe story is quite overwhelming, especially when taking into account the previous game’s story as well as the various expansions and content already released. However, the free-to-play version has been updated with newcomers in mind, offering a remastered version of the stories past, slowly introducing the player to the lore and the game.\r\nYou don’t need to have played Destiny 1, or have bought any expansions if you want to dive into Destiny 2: Lightfall. The game is standalone and can stand on its own as both a welcoming experience for newcomers and an expansion to existing players. However, it's recommended to play through the base game Destiny 2 first.\r\nThe Lightfall Expansion:\r\nThe real standout feature of Lightfall is the new Strand subclasses. One for each of the game's three main classes: Hunter, Titan, and Warlock.\r\nThe Warlock Broodweaver allows players to summon and project threadling creatures, which can be used to attack enemies and defend allies.\r\nThe Titan Berserker subclass features dual-wielding fist blades that allow players to carve through enemies with ease. This subclass also grants allies extra armor, making it a valuable addition to any team.\r\nThe Hunter Threadrunner subclass utilizes a rope dart to debuff enemies and create extra grapple points for allies. This subclass is great for players who prefer a more tactical playstyle, as it allows for strategic movement and positioning on the battlefield.\r\nThese subclasses completely change the way you approach combat and give you a lot more never-done-before elements when it comes to taking down enemies.  There are also various balance changes like difficulty increases, higher ability cooldowns, economy changes; and rebalanced mods and gun mechanics.\r\nThe Story\r\nThe campaign for Lightfall is quite short. Coming in from the Witch Queen expansion, it is a bit underwhelming and there isn’t enough stakes for the story nor enough explanation given to the player to care or to be amazed. For the story content, the roughly six hour campaign is not really worth the $50 asking price. In fact, for newcomers, the free-to-play aspect of Destiny 2 holds more than enough value to play over this new expansion. After that, they can try out the other expansions as well, usually sold in a bundle.\r\nTechnical Performance\r\nSince this is a six-year old game, running Destiny 2: Lightfall at high FPS ranges is easily achievable. After all, the game only requires a 2nd-gen i5 from 2011 and a GTX 970 to comfortably run. However, the new destination Neomuna, despite looking so good, feels so empty and lifeless. It's not very much open for exploration and there are no civilians and NPCs roaming about in this city. Although there is an in-lore explanation, it felt like a cheap cop-out to explain the situation. Engine limitations? Possibly. If you’re familiar with some of the assets you will also notice a lot of them are heavily reused.\r\nHowever, the campaign being short and underwhelming and the new location being void of NPCs does detract from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, Lightfall is a must-play for longtime fans of the series. If you are a newcomer, better stick to the free-to-play base game first and see if you will like it to justify spending money for the expansions.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4689787) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fast-paced, action-packed RPG that draws inspiration from the Souls-like genre popularized by Dark Souls and recently, Elden Ring.\r\nDeveloped by KOEI and published by Team Ninja, players take on the role of a customizable protagonist and are inserted in a world of historical fantasy set in the Three-Kingdoms Era, complete with demons. Players must battle their way through hordes of demons and historical figures using a variety of weapons, spells, and skills; and must rise from zero to hero.\r\nThe story is an interesting mix of Chinese history but on steroids, kind of like the game series Dynasty Warriors but set in a much darker tone with the inclusion of demons.\r\nOne of my most anticipated aspects is the flashy combat system. Like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, the game places a heavy emphasis on parrying, which can be used to quickly turn the tables on enemies and deal devastating damage. While blocking and dodging are also viable options, parrying is the most effective way to defeat many of the game's bosses, making it a key skill for players to master. The combat is highly fast-paced, filled with constant hits, blocks, and parries that are so satisfying and gratifying to do and never gets old.\r\nHowever, players must also manage their spirit gauge, which is a modified version of a typical stamina system. It is depleted by most actions such as blocking, dodging, or casting a spell. If players overextend themselves and use too much spirit, their character will become fatigued and temporarily unable to take any actions. To replenish the spirit gauge, players must strike with light attacks instead of letting it regenerate on its own.\r\nThis is an amazing change to the formula that encourages fast-paced action and constant trade-offs with the enemy, not allowing room for ultra-defensive and evasive combat styles from players.\r\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty features a linear mission-based structure, and there are also side missions that you can consider. These missions culminate in a boss fight at the end, which is another highlight of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. The game features a diverse range of bosses, from small human vs. human battles to giant enemy encounters. Including famous generals and warlords from the Three Kingdoms era, such as Lu Bu and Cao Cao.\r\nDespite being a singleplayer oriented experience, the game also features co-op play features, so its great news for players who are looking to play and get social. You can summon up to two friends to help you with tough enemies and boss fights. The invasion system from the Dark Souls series is also adapted and present in the game, allowing for some PvP action.\r\nEach encounter requires a different approach and strategy, and it is generally a forgiving mechanic, as long as you've mastered the enemy telegraphs and move sets as well as your own. I've had no frustrations, so it must be relatively well balanced.\r\nThe fast-paced and relentless combat mechanics are challenging and engaging, requiring players to stay focused and adapt to various enemy types and attack patterns. This kind of combat system can provide a satisfying sense of achievement when successfully defeating a tough enemy or boss, and instills a relentless determination to achieve success while in the process of beating them.\r\nSo far, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is looking like a game that will scratch that itch that Sekiro and Nioh have left, and provide both a great extension of the Souls-like genre, and a refreshing take on the formula.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4690976) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fast-paced, souls-like third person RPG set in a fictionalized version of ancient Three Kingdoms China.\r\n## Pros\r\n- fun combat mechanics\r\n- fairly challenging enemies\r\n- varied boss fights\r\n## Cons\r\n- Major performance and optimization issues\r\n## The Three Kingdoms again?\r\nIt seems that KOEI of Dynasty Warriors and Romance of the Three Kingdoms fame is not yet done with the Three Kingdoms era with yet another take on the setting, this time with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, drawing inspiration from the Dark Souls series and the genre it spawned. Players must battle their way through hordes of demons and historical figures using a variety of weapons, spells, and skills; and must rise from zero to hero.\r\nPlayers take on the role of a customizable protagonist and are inserted in a world of historical fantasy set in the Three-Kingdoms Era.\r\nDespite having a “voice” option in the pretty robust character customization menu, the main character is a silent protagonist, which can lead to awkward moments when other characters are speaking to him and the script is trying its absolute best to make the dialogue work with only just the protagonist silently staring.\r\nThe whole story centers around a mystical elixir that gives power and everlasting life. Amidst all the chaos, demons have also invaded and pose a threat to the land. The story is simple but is teeming with historical detail, from the Yellow Turban Rebellion to Chinese historical figures like Zhao Yun and Zhang Liang, of course, highly fictionalized over-the-top versions of them.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nThe combat system is based on timing and mastering the parry system, requiring players to plan their attacks and conserve energy rather than relying on pure aggressiveness. Parrying can be used to quickly turn the tables on enemies and deal devastating damage. While blocking and dodging are also viable options, parrying is the most effective way to defeat many of the game's bosses, making it a key skill for players to master. The combat is highly fast-paced, filled with constant hits, blocks, and parries that are so satisfying and gratifying to do and never gets old.\r\nHowever, players must also manage their Spirit Gauge, which is a modified version of a melee stamina system. It is depleted by most actions such as blocking, dodging, or casting a spell. If players overextend themselves and use too much spirit, their character will become fatigued and temporarily unable to take any actions. To quickly replenish the spirit gauge, players must strike with light attacks instead of letting it regenerate on its own. This reminded me of the Monk character in the game Diablo III, where you also need to balance your resource — coincidentally called Spirit as well.\r\nThis is an amazing change to the formula that encourages fast-paced action and constant trade-offs with the enemy, not allowing room for ultra-defensive and evasive combat styles from players as well ultra aggressive play styles too. Players can even play this game without ever dodging or blocking, as players can parry all attacks as long as the timing is right, from normal enemies or heavy attacks from gigantic bosses alike.\r\nThe melee combat offers players a variety of weapon types to use, from the likes of swords, sabers, spears, and even halberds. All offering different kinds of combat styles to the player. Not just that, but it also features ranged combat as well, but this isn’t really the type of game that lingers too much on ranged combat, which functions more like a mandatory inclusion more than anything.\r\n## Level up your Virtues\r\nIt also features RPG elements, mainly with the “Virtues” that the main character has: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water – based on the Five Phases of Yin-Yang. Gameplay wise, it is basically a replacement of the typical Strength, Agility, and Intelligence system. Players have full choice on what virtue to level and each of the five virtues grants different bonuses that will help players in their preferred playstyle.\r\nThe ability to wear heavier equipment, unlockable magic abilities, increased spirit generation, consumption, defense, and many more are decided by these five virtues. Players level these virtues by defeating enemies and accumulating Qi, half of which is lost upon dying.\r\n## Not every game needs open-world\r\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty features a linear mission-based structure, and there are also side missions that players can consider to further improve their character and better prepare them for the main missions. Across the levels, players will need to utilize the morale system, which governs how much damage they can inflict to and take from enemies.\r\nEach area, players start from zero and gain more morale by constantly defeating other enemies and planting battle flags around the map, to a maximum morale level of 25. Dying reduces their morale, and slightly increases the morale of that specific enemy, making it slightly harder to take revenge. This system is basically agar.io in disguise: players eat up the morale of their enemies to increase their own.\r\nThis system makes it harder for people to rush into boss fights across the map, while also making it easier for players who want to take their time and try to farm morale first before trying to beat the boss. These missions always culminate in a boss fight at the end, which is another highlight of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.\r\nThe game features a diverse range of bosses, from small human vs. human battles to giant enemy encounters. Including famous generals and warlords from the Three Kingdoms era, such as Liu Bei and Cao Cao. Some bosses have more than one phase, some even evolving to a bigger weight-class than expected.\r\nEach enemy encounter requires a different approach and strategy, and it is generally a forgiving combat system, as long as you've mastered the enemy telegraphs and move sets as well as your own. I've experienced no frustrations whatsoever, so it must be relatively well balanced.\r\nThe fast-paced and relentless combat mechanics are challenging and engaging, requiring players to stay focused and adapt to various enemy types and attack patterns. This kind of combat system can provide a satisfying sense of achievement when successfully defeating a tough enemy or boss, and instills a relentless determination to achieve success while in the process of beating them.\r\nWhen you’re not battling historical figures and characters, you are befriending them, as throughout the campaign, you will meet many heroic figures that can be called-in as reinforcements in missions — up to two of them — that functions like a NPC companion that tags along with you.\r\nDespite being a single player oriented experience, the game also features co-op play that will essentially replace the reinforcement system, so it's great news for players who are looking to play and get social. You can summon up to two friends to help you to help with tough enemies and boss fights. The invasion system from the Dark Souls series is also adapted and present in the game, allowing for some PvP action. There are also minor asymmetric multiplayer elements present.\r\n## Technical Performance:\r\nTested on a PC with a i7-8700k, RTX 3080, and 32GB RAM, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty suffers from bad performance levels on PC even with higher end setups. Microstutters are present all the time and the frame-time is NEVER on a flat line, leading to an unsatisfactory performance throughout the entirety of the experience. No graphics setting -- nevermind the lack thereof -- was able to fix this. Additionally, this game is best played — or rather, at this time of writing — is only strictly playable on controllers, as the mouse camera is currently non-functional.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a solid entry in the action-RPG genre. While it may not revolutionize the genre, it provides a challenging, entertaining, and still somewhat accessible experience that fans of the Souls-like genre will appreciate, as long as you can bear with the current performance issues of the PC version. If you're looking for a game with fast-paced combat, fresh mechanics, and engaging boss battles, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is definitely worth checking out.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4699145) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Limbus Company is a narratively driven turn-based RPG game with gacha elements. Made for mobile phones and also ported to PCs.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Weird intriguing story\r\n- Unique gameplay mechanics\r\n- gacha and live service elements are highly optional\r\n## Cons\r\n- Confusing early-mid game (story and mechanics)\r\n- Short and incomplete story\r\n## It’s intriguingly weird\r\nLimbus Company is a weird game, there’s no putting it lightly. Your character has a flaming clock for a head, suddenly followed by a suicidal undying highschooler-looking crew riding on a magic bus, the whole premise is just absurd and confusing. However, don’t let that turn you off as the story is actually one of the main selling points of this narrative-driven turn-based gacha RPG game.\r\nSet in a massive dystopian steampunk-looking metropolis, players will embark on a journey to find the 12 Golden Boughs. It is also set in the same world as the previous games, Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruins from its developers Project Moon.\r\n## Information overload\r\nThis free-to-play game packs more story that I had anticipated, even more so than many full-pledged PC and console games. The game’s introduction hits like a (Lim)bus when it comes to the exposition to the plot, showering you with tons of text ridden panels explaining the lore, and introducing you to more than 10 anime-like characters — inspired by real-world literature — all in your first 15 minutes of play.\r\nAnd as if that’s not enough, it also dumps on the player what feels like a tens of hours worth of game mechanics in just a one hour span. The game is like, “here it is, now move on to the next one”. Nothing will make sense and the players will barely grasp the whole idea of the mechanics. However, there remains a tiny sliver of interesting bits in this game that is compelling enough to make players stay. Is it the stylish turn-based action-packed 2D fights? Is it rich storytelling? Maybe a little bit of both.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nThe battles are simplistic mechanically, just as simple as drawing a line to form a chain of attack commands for the whole team to play out at once. Combos are done by chaining similarly colored moves and abilities to each other. This system overall feels like a three-match game in disguise that ranks color combos and associations above everything else.\r\nThe resulting presentation of the automated combat is visually stunning and action-packed. The animations of the fights are cool and felt like anime characters duking it out with over-the-top stylish slashes and gory dismemberments.\r\nThe main character is an amnesiac named Dante, his head is a burning clock for some reason, and he encounters this trusty mystical crew called the Sinners that follows his lead. He becomes a sort of a coach / manager for this team, but he has no damn idea why anyway, conveniently sharing the same confusion he has with the players.\r\nAll I can think of is that the premise is a darker, more twisted 2D version of a Persona game. The game is fully voiced in the Korean language but thankfully there are English subtitles.\r\nThe entirety of Limbus Company comprises a linear progression system through various levels inside chapters,  back and forth-ing between visual novel-esque cutscenes that advance the story, or battles that you have to complete to unlock the next level.\r\nThe end of the chapters culminates in a mini dungeon-crawler experience that presents the players with more battles to conquer. Ofcourse, the main loop here is to level up your characters and learn more of how the mechanics work, in order to beat higher levels and advance the story.\r\nBefore the start of the battle, players will select up to five members to bring to the fight. This aspect is also important to the strategy, as this can heavily make or break your success. However, during the first few parts of the story, I found no attachment whatsoever to the characters nor did I find any difference between them power and skill wise.\r\nThere is a time-currency energy aspect that limits your ability to enter battles, and you have to wait out real-world time in order to replenish this currency. However during the first few bits of the game, I’ve had more than plenty of currency to play continuously without it being a show-stopper.\r\nOf course, in time, this will probably be a huge limiting factor in the later parts of the story. There are gacha elements, but they mostly serve as additional flavor to the characters and not really a soft requirement in order to progress. Although again, in eventual later chapters, this might change and become a necessity.\r\nYou can’t really binge this game from start to end\r\nWith its gacha and live service elements, Limbus Company is a game that is designed to be played for a long time — for small bits at a time — not for a weekend, not for a month, but for months up to years of occasional checking in. Currently, the game is only playable up to Chapter 3, with further chapters to be added in the future as part of a live service offering. There is a bit of replayability in the form of mirror dungeons, which are playable up to once a day.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nIts overwhelming gameplay concepts, incomplete story, play-limiting live service elements, and gacha elements is what stops this game from being a great story-rich RPG game overall. Still, Limbus Company is a game worth a shot since it’s just a free-to-play title, especially for turn-based RPG fans looking for a unique experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4713085) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The King of Fighters All Star is an online RPG brawler that brings together characters from the popular fighting game franchise The King of Fighters. If you’re still expecting a 1v1 competitive fighting game like the original game series, this is far from it. However, this is still a cool game worth looking into.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fun beat’ em up gameplay\r\n- Engaging campaign and team-building mechanics\r\n- Smooth 2.5D HD graphics\r\n- Many playable characters from across the King of Fighters series.## Cons\r\n-Performance issues\r\n-Not the traditional fighting game format like the original series.\r\nThe King of Fighters ALLSTAR, or KOF ALLSTAR, is a mobile beat ‘em up game mixed with RPG and gacha elements. It borrows from the 20-30 years of King of Fighters history and characters, combining them together to create an Ultimate King of Fighters game tailor-made for mobile devices. It was also officially released for PC last year as an emulated-port.\r\nAn adaptation of The King of Fighters series\r\nThe game's story follows a group of fighters who are brought together to compete in a tournament known as the King of Fighters. Along the way, they must battle a variety of opponents, most are basic henchmen, others are KOF characters with their own unique abilities and fighting styles as well.\r\nThe game's narrative format is told through a series of 2D cutscenes and skippable dialogue in-between missions, which help to flesh out the characters and provide context for their motivations.\r\nThe missions themselves are saga’s adapted from the classic games and contain different chapters with missions. The initial saga, the Orochi Saga, is composed of eight chapters and the first half is beatable in a single seating. However, the difficulty spikes up halfway through it and you’d have to do a bit of grinding before you can progress further.\r\nThere are also other adapted sagas to complete and replayable activities to do, like PVP mode and Dungeon modes which offer infinite replayability, as long as you have the time-currency needed. More updates are on the way, including further saga adaptations, as this is a live service game.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay in The King of Fighters ALLSTAR is a mix of beat’ em up and a bit of tactics/strategy. Players must build a team of up to three main fighters, supported by three more as “strikers” and use them to battle against enemies or other teams.  Pairing characters with specific strikers will provide additional bonuses, depending on their relationships in the lore.\r\nThe battles take place in real-time in a side-scrolling manner, and players must use a variety of attacks and combos to defeat their opponents. Each fighter has their own set of skills and abilities in a MOBA-like fashion and controls, which can be upgraded as the player progresses through the game.\r\nThe combat is simply addicting and made relatively easy to control. One button to attack, another to dodge, and another to block. Then the rest are entirely the abilities that the characters have. Combos and hits are satisfying to perform, especially when the enemies are constantly bouncing around the maps. When the enemies are on a higher level, it is also a fairly challenging game that will require more use of defensive maneuvers.\r\nAt first, you start with just one fighter, then the more you play, the more you unlock character cards, which you can now equip as fighters. When using multiple fighters, you can seamlessly switch between them as long as the cooldown is up. You can also assign a “striker” fighter for each fighter that you can all in to do occasional support attacks alongside the player.\r\nWhen using multiple fighters, you can seamlessly switch between them as long as the cooldown is up. You can also assign a “striker” fighter for each fighter that you can all in to do occasional support attacks alongside the player.\r\nThe King of Fighters ALLSTAR has amazing 2.5D HD graphics. The game's visuals are stunning, with detailed character models and fluid animations that bring the fighters to life, both in the 2D art and in the 3D cell-shaded in-game graphics. The backgrounds are also well-designed, with a variety of locations that range from various city streets to ancient ruins.\r\nThe music is catchy and upbeat, with a variety of tracks that match the different moods and settings of the game. The sound effects are also well-done, with satisfying impact sounds for each attack and combo perfectly matching the well-animated fight moves.\r\nThe Progression\r\nIn terms of its RPG mechanics, The King of Fighters ALLSTAR does a good job of balancing character progression with challenge, and the gacha elements more or less just supplement the system, not completely take over it. Players can earn experience points and level up the fighters in-use, which increases their stats and unlocks new abilities. However, the game's difficulty also scales with the player's progress, so battles never feel too easy or too difficult.\r\nThe game's monetization model is a mix of free-to-play and pay-to-win. Players can earn in-game currency by completing missions and quests, which can be used to purchase new fighters and upgrade their skills.\r\nHowever, the game also offers a variety of microtransactions, such as premium currency and loot boxes, which can give players an advantage in battle and speed up progression. While these transactions are not necessary to enjoy the game, they do give paying players a significant advantage over those who choose not to spend money.\r\nTechnical Analysis\r\nI tested it with a Razer Kishi game controller, and it has rudimentary support for it. Every basic button and control works, however don’t expect heavy customization as you cannot rebind the controls nor change anything controller related in the game.\r\nAs for the performance, KOF ALLSTAR did not perform well during my testing on a Samsung S9+, with constant lags and stutters during gameplay, as well as minor online connection issues. I also encountered a game-breaking bug that froze my progression for a while, not allowing me to proceed further in the menu.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4713094) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With its gacha-infused side-scrolling RPG fighting gameplay, this game offers a unique experience that is both addicting and exciting.\r\nThe developers are calling it a “tap-and-flick” fighting action game, and while I agree that is an simplistic description of the gameplay, there is much more to that, with various actions and moves that you can do despite its simplistic controls.\r\nHey you, you’re finally awake\r\nYou suddenly find yourself in the middle of a fight without memories. A girl named Ney is trying to kill you, and you are saved by another girl named Nya (yes those are the names). Aside from these girls are cyborg looking creatures that are also out to get you.

It’s simple enough to allow players to play one-handed, but it is also functional for two-handed play if you wish to do so. At any part of the screen, flicks usually control the movement, such as dodges, jumps and moving the character. taps result in an attack, while holding it causes a special attack.\r\nPlayers can seamlessly switch between their three selected fighters to integrate combo attacks and gain attack bonuses. If players time it right, it is possible to chain combos together that will involve all three fighters together along with the support, complete with cool looking animations.\r\nThe Divine Power ability adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, giving you a special attack to unleash when the time is right.

In-between battles, you get bits of storytelling. Having said that, I find the levels and encounters too short, almost always ending abruptly for my liking.\r\nOf course, by playing the game and advancing the story through various chapters and battles, you can level your acquired characters and \"evolve\" them into higher ratings. unlocking new bonuses and abilities, and gaining more materials to use for additional upgrades as well.\r\nFree-to-play and gacha elements\r\nOne thing to note is the time-currency and gacha elements of the game. You only have a limited amount of playtime each day before it runs out, so you'll need to play smart and strategize your time to get the most out of the game, or pay real-world cash.\r\nAs with gacha elements, the more you spend, the better quality characters you gain push for in a shorter amount of time. Despite that, it’s not pay-to-win, and you can still expect many hours of free-to-play gameplay with this game, especially with the time-currency features, before hitting the proverbial paywall.\r\nThe Art\r\nThe 2D artwork is beautifully made — more specifically — tailor-crafted to appease male fans with the sexy character designs — and the 3D cel-shaded graphics during gameplay is up to par.

    "body": "Company of Heroes 3 sets players in the midst of World War II as they take command of their armies and engage in tactical battles against player and/or AI controlled enemies. While the game's multiplayer and skirmish modes are a major draw for many players, the single-player experience is equally engaging and worth playing.\r\nCompany of Heroes 3’s two main campaigns take players through a series of historical battles, with each mission providing unique challenges and objectives like capturing, rescuing, defending, or halting enemies. The campaigns are set in Italy, following the Allied Forces as they push through the country, facing off against the Axis Powers at every turn; and in North Africa, at the perspective of Germans fighting the British Army.\r\nThe gameplay mechanics of Company of Heroes 3 allows players to command a wide range of military units, each with their own strengths and weaknesses that is fairly balanced to make you utilize each and every available unit, from infantry, artillery, air support, tanks, and trucks; everything has use.\r\nThe terrain and environment also play a significant role in the gameplay, with players needing to carefully navigate the battlefield and use cover to their advantage. The environment is highly destructible, dynamic craters resulting from barrages and explosions that your units can also utilize as cover, enterable buildings that can be destroyed to flush out people taking cover, and bridges to destroy to stop hostile enemies from advancing.\r\nResources are also integrated to the maps as control points scattered that you need to capture and defend. The more control points you take, the better the resource flow you’ll have. Providing a tactical element when it comes to territory and resources. Leading to some nice back and forth between opposing fronts, as well as naturally giving risks to the player whether to establish a chokepoint, turtle up, or stretch their forces beyond to capture more points.\r\nIn addition to the campaign mode, Company of Heroes 3 also includes skirmish mode, where players can battle against player or AI-controlled enemies in custom matches. Skirmish mode provides a sandbox-like experience with traditional RTS building mechanics, allowing players to experiment with different units and strategies without the pressure of a scripted setting or predetermined gameplay conditions. You can even play with friends and pit yourselves against AI enemies in a cooperative fashion, which is a whole other layer of fun on its own.\r\nAside from the faction and setting, there is a key difference between these two campaigns. Italy has a brand new game mechanic to it, an overworld turn-based mechanic that takes pages from popular grand strategy games like Total War where you take turns moving your different units across a macro-scale campaign map, while the battles are settled in an micro-scale RTS manner. On the other hand, The North African campaign is more of a traditional campaign with linear missions and objectives only.\r\nSo far, the experience in Company of Heroes 3 is engaging and rewarding, providing players with a deep and varied gameplay experience. The campaign missions are engaging and provide a historical context for the battles, while the gameplay mechanics and AI provide a challenging and tactical experience.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

The game has simple controls and a straightforward gameplay loop, which makes it accessible to players of all skill levels,even non-gamers. However, there is still plenty of depth and strategy to be found in the game, as players learn to read each other's body language, poker faces, truth and lies; and use subtle cues to uncover the Impostors.\r\nNow, in 2023, Among Us is still alive and kicking, with continuous updates that still follow the same formula, only being welcome improvements. A major update in 2021, added optional specialized roles like Engineers that can travel vents, adding to the confusion; Scientists that can keep current vitals of all players, and Guardian Angels that can protect players from getting killed.\r\nA few weeks ago, last December 2022, an alternative Hide n Seek game mode was added. There is only one impostor, its identity revealed, and there are no meetings or ejections. Removing all deduction elements and making this gamemode a full-on hunter and hunted asymmetric survival game.\r\nAmong Us also occasionally does collaborations with other franchises that adds new cosmetics to use such as the Spartan Armor from Halo, or character skins from League of Legends. More recently, they have a new collaboration with Destiny 2, adding cool new cosmetics such as Hunter, Warlock, and Titan skins.\r\nIn 2023, Among Us is still such a fun, tense experience that only seems to be getting better with modest updates that keeps players interested, even amidst all the eventual release of many games it inspired.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4730018) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Sephirothic Stories is a mobile game developed by KEMCO, a well known JRPG developer for the mobile platform, and it is another addition to their fast growing roster. As a japanese role-playing game, it features a turn-based combat experience, exploration with some unique mechanics, and a cute art-style.\r\nThe game immediately kicks off to our gameplay and story without any background explanation or lore introduction, and immediately acquaints us with Chibi looking 3D characters Harold and Izzy, and eventually other friendly characters as well. The world is populated by both humans and anthropomorphic animals alike, with Izzy being a humanoid lizard as an example.\r\nThe story starts off with a rescue mission of sorts involving mysterious never before seen powerful monsters that roam the land. It's pretty generic, nothing that I’ve never seen before type of kind of deal that I bet after a while it will just blur with other similarly themed JRPG memories that I’ve played.\r\nThe gameplay of Sephirothic Stories is about navigating through various PS1-era looking levels filled with randomized spawn of enemies, and trying to go to the next destination or beat the next monster to advance the story. Bumping with monsters initiates a turn-based battle combat with a typical system of using attack, skills, or items. However one defining mechanic is the Focus system where you can set up a specific combination of skills that you can regularly use.\r\nThe random monsters that respawn every time you enter an area are just standing in place, so you can easily avoid them if you want to, as long as they're not directly blocking the path. However the game’s movement controls are so clunky that you’ll often find it challenging to avoid these static enemies, unwittingly adding another layer to the difficulty.\r\nPlayers can switch off to any character in the player's party at will, to take advantage of each of everyone’s individual skills and talents to help players explore.  While roaming in hostile territory, there is a Murk Meter that slowly increases, filling this up will force their party to retreat to the village to recuperate, adding an exhaustion element that will force players to manage their time and very carefully.\r\nI have a bit of a mixed feeling for Sephirothic Stories. Unique gameplay elements like the Focus system and the character-centric exploration mechanics have made a positive first impression on my initial experience while clunky controls and generic storytelling have been the negative impressions so far.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4737018) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Among Us is a multiplayer deduction party game set on a spaceship where players take on the role of either a Crewmate or a killer Impostor.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Thrilling deduction experience\r\n- Simple and accessible, even non-gamers can play\r\n- Highly customizable parameters## Cons\r\n-No cons\r\nAmong Us is an incredibly fun and addicting multiplayer game that challenges your deduction and deception skills. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete various tasks around the ship, kick out any Impostors; while the Impostors must sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being caught, before all the tasks are complete.\r\nThroughout the years, I’ve played my fair share of deduction games like Town of Salem and Gmod’s Trouble in Terrorist Town, but when I first played Among Us last 2018, it was still one of the best multiplayer gaming experiences I’ve ever had with friends. And what was even better is that there is a mobile version, with crossplay, so almost everyone can jump in and build out a group to play with, as long as you have a phone. It has something to do with how simple and accessible this game is, yet the experience is so thrilling and addictive.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nWhat makes Among Us so exciting is the constant tension between the Crewmates and Impostors. As a Crewmate, you have to keep a close eye on your fellow players and try to figure out who the Impostors are before it's too late. Meanwhile, as an Impostor, you have to use your wits and deception skills to blend in with the Crewmates and carry out your nefarious plans.\r\nWhile in the ship, Crewmates must also perform tasks throughout the ship in the form of fun and cute mini-games, which if fully completed by everyone, grants an automatic win. Adding a time limiting element to matches that encourages both Crewmates and Impostors to act quickly and decisively. Even if the Crewmates are dead, they still have to perform tasks in order to help the still alive Crewmates.\r\nOne of the best things about Among Us is how easy it is to pick up and play. The game has simple controls and a straightforward gameplay loop, which makes it accessible to players of all skill levels, even non-gamers. However, there is still plenty of depth and strategy to be found in the game, as players learn to read each other's body language, poker faces, truth and lies; and use subtle cues to uncover the Impostors.\r\nHighly customizable parameters\r\nThe matches in Among Us are also highly customizable to the players preference, almost everything is adjustable, kill cooldowns, distances, character visions, various timers, the number of tasks, and many more. Giving a powerful tool for a group of players to achieve the right amount of their preferred balance to the game. No need to wait for the developers to buff or nerf mechanics, nor to install mods.\r\nThe graphics and sound design in Among Us are also top-notch. The cartoonish visuals and quirky animations give the game a unique and charming style,  while the sound effects and music create a tense and immersive atmosphere so impressive that they both still have a massive cultural impact up to this day and have become easily recognizable for almost everyone.\r\nLabor of Love\r\nNow, in 2023 Among Us is still alive and kicking, with continuous updates that still follow the same formula, only being welcome improvements. A major update in 2021, added optional specialized roles like Engineers that can travel vents, adding to the confusion; Scientists that can keep current vitals of all players, and Guardian Angels that can protect players from getting killed.\r\nA few weeks ago, last December 2022, an alternative Hide n Seek game mode was added. There is only one impostor, its identity revealed, and there are no meetings or ejections. Removing all deduction elements and making this game mode a full-on hunter and hunted asymmetric survival game.\r\nAmong Us also occasionally does collaborations with other franchises that adds new cosmetics to use such as the Spartan Armor from Halo, or character skins from League of Legends.

    "body": "Company of Heroes 3 is a WW2 real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by SEGA, and continues the critically acclaimed Company of Heroes series of games.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Immersive RTS experience\r\n- Deep tactical gameplay\r\n- Decent graphics## Cons\r\n-High price for what it brings\r\n-UI and camera work needs polishing\r\n-Buggy game overall\r\nCompany of Heroes 3 sets players in the midst of World War II as they take command of their armies and engage in tactical battles against player and/or AI controlled enemies. While the game's multiplayer and skirmish modes are a major draw for many players, the single-player experience is equally engaging and worth playing.\r\nAs someone who extensively played the first Company of Heroes game as a kid, playing it as a sort of sandbox game with countless skirmishes matches on top of finishing the campaign; and as someone who has played Company of Heroes 2 multiplayer extensively, I was very excited to finally try the latest installment in what is now a trilogy of WW2 RTS games.\r\nDoes it hold up?\r\nGood news is, if you loved both Company of Heroes 1 and 2, then you’ll feel right at home with this one. However, the first two are such great games in their own right that it felt like the third game had no room for improvement or evolution. In some aspects, it even felt like a step backwards.\r\nThe first game had such unreal graphics during its time and as a result, the graphics have not significantly improved aside from minor realism improvements like better lighting and higher resolution textures. This was the same case with the second game, but now even more notice-able with the third game. The graphics have continuously improved, yes, but the diminishing returns are quite obvious.\r\nTaking it at face value, the graphics are still amazing for an RTS game. Everything is jam-packed with detail: the infantry units, the tanks, the structures, even the terrain and animals in the map could actually pass as a third person view graphics.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nCompany of Heroes 3’s two main campaigns take players through a series of historical battles, with each mission providing unique challenges and objectives like capturing, rescuing, defending, or halting enemies. The campaigns are set in Italy, following the Allied Forces as they push through the country, facing off against the Axis Powers at every turn; and in North Africa, at the perspective of Germans fighting the British Army.\r\nThe gameplay mechanics of Company of Heroes 3 allows players to command a wide range of military units, each with their own strengths and weaknesses that is fairly balanced to make you utilize each and every available unit, from infantry, artillery, air support, tanks, and trucks; everything has use.\r\nCompared to the previous games, the balancing of the units are more lenient now with the damages, strengths and weakness. For example Anti-tank support groups are now also useful against infantry, instead of being strictly for tanks only. This hard counter system has gone soft and it makes for a more accessible game, at the potential cost of losing competitive depth and being imbalanced in highly competitive play.\r\nThe terrain and environment also play a significant role in the gameplay, with players needing to carefully navigate the battlefield and use cover to their advantage.\r\nThe environment is highly destructible, dynamic craters resulting from barrages and explosions that your units can also utilize as cover, enterable buildings that can be destroyed to flush out people taking cover, and bridges to destroy to stop hostile enemies from advancing.\r\nResources are also integrated to the maps as control points scattered that you need to capture and defend. The more control points you take, the better the resource flow you’ll have. Providing a tactical element when it comes to territory and resources. Leading to some nice back and forth between opposing fronts, as well as naturally giving risks to the player whether to establish a chokepoint, turtle up, or stretch their forces beyond to capture more points.\r\nIn addition to the campaign mode, Company of Heroes 3 also includes skirmish mode, where players can battle against player or AI-controlled enemies in custom matches. Skirmish mode provides a sandbox-like experience with traditional RTS building mechanics, allowing players to experiment with different units and strategies without the pressure of a scripted setting or predetermined gameplay conditions. You can even play with friends and pit yourselves against AI enemies in a cooperative fashion, which is a whole other layer of fun on its own.\r\nBest-in-class WW2 RTS action-simulation\r\nWhile it is a competitive RTS game at its core, Company of Heroes 3 is a highly immersive game with realistic bits and pieces of world war 2 action. The animations are more dynamic and lifelike than ever before. The physics simulation, the destructible buildings, even the explosions are realistically made, complete with shattering windows that highly immerses the player like they’re controlling a real company in a real world war 2 setting.\r\nCompany of Heroes goes turn-based\r\nAside from the faction and setting, there is a key difference between these two campaigns. Italy has a brand new game mechanic to it, an overworld turn-based mechanic  that takes pages from popular grand strategy games like Total War where you take turns moving your different units across a macro-scale campaign map, while the battles are settled in an micro-scale RTS manner. On the other hand, The North African campaign is more of a traditional campaign with linear missions and objectives only.\r\nThe addition of turn-based to the is a welcome feature that hoped to revolutionize the series’ gameplay, including various elements such as capturing cities, building reinforcements, and unlocking new abilities, units, and upgrades.\r\nHowever, not everyone is a fan of this. Although I do love the Total War games, turn-based is not something I am expecting for a Company of Heroes game, especially with the excellent linear campaigns of the first two games. The inclusion of a turn-based campaign can detract from the overall RTS-focused experience.\r\nThe AI in Company of Heroes in general is also formidable, with enemies providing a decent challenge even on lower difficulty levels. The AI adapts to the player's tactics and strategies, meaning that players need to stay on their toes and adapt their approach as the battle progresses. The game also includes a variety of difficulty levels in both the campaign and skirmishes, ensuring that players of all skill levels can find a challenge that suits them.\r\nHowever, it seems that the AI is not as good as I remember with the previous games, with units consistently unnecessarily running towards the line of fire, tanks and vehicles suddenly reversing for no good reason, and units hideously clipping constantly with each other.\r\nTechnical Performance\r\nPlaying on a i7-8700k, 32GB RAM, and RTX 3080. This game ran decently, never dropping 60 fps at 900p, but the performance is a bit choppy at times due to unstable frame timing. There are also various UI and control annoyances, with the standout being the camera controls; even at its lowest settings, panning around using the keyboard is too fast, and zoom levels are lacking. Also, even though the game is scheduled to release on console platforms, I find it disappointing that there is no controller support for the PC version.\r\nHowever, as a game on its own, Company of Heroes 3 is a decent game with its detailed graphics, engaging realistic battles, and rewarding tactical elements. Still, if you haven’t played the first two yet, I suggest starting with them, especially if you can get them on a sale. Only purchase this if you have played the first two games and are intensely itching for more.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4743716) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Rumble Heroes : Adventure RPG’s gameplay is similar to Vampire Survivors; you only control using one hand and you only control movements of the characters, nothing else. However it adds more complexity and depth to the game by introducing various adventure RPG concepts. Traversing through the land, encountering different characters, building your party, and resting in camps and villages.\r\nThe combat is fun and satisfying for the most part that compels me enough to play, and it does it without requiring any effort from the player. Players just have to bring the party within attack range, stop moving, and they will automatically bash and hit their enemies to death.\r\nHowever, it becomes clear that this is a trade-off for some proper skill-based combat, as there is no way to handle enemy attacks but to mostly brute force tank them. There isn’t even a way to reliably control which character goes in front and gets damaged. So if you’re looking for a game that is deep on the active combat mechanics, this is not it.\r\nPlayers generally control multiple characters at once, and gather more characters to choose from along the way. Or sometimes, in a gacha-like recruitment system. There are many different heroes to gain, from simple axe-wielding joes to full-on rogues and mages\r\nIn Rumble Heroes, progression is tied to the series of increasingly difficult areas in the world, requiring you to upgrade your characters and level them up to be able to withstand further locations.\r\nPlayers will encounter dungeons and quests along the way that gives players another excuse to kill monsters. The dungeons are wave-like and require players to clear all enemies, one level after the next. There are bosses in both the world and dungeons, providing a hefty challenge to players.\r\nFurther adding to the already gameplay rich world of Rumble Heroes, there is a bit of resource gathering and minor base building elements while exploring the land, sometimes requiring you to gather wood, meat, and minerals, to be able to perform different actions like activating new structures, revealing locked zones, completing quests, recruiting heroes from the pub, and upgrading them.\r\nIn Rumble Heroes, All of these gameplay elements result in a rather engaging dynamic system that seamlessly switches from killing monsters, bosses, to gathering resources and building structures, on a whim.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4749590) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Call of Dragons is a new upcoming fantasy strategy mobile game that features city-building aspects combined with strategy war game and RPG elements. It is currently available for testing on mobile devices and for PC as well as an emulated-port.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Beautiful graphics and presentation\r\n- Highly engaging game mechanics\r\n- Commendable user experience## Cons\r\n-time consuming\r\n-Heavy pay to win elements\r\nFrom the makers of the popular strategy game Rise of Kingdoms, comes another similar game with a Lord of the Rings makeover. A fantasy world populated by Orcs, Humans, Elves, these three races have been at war for the longest time, until the arrival of a universal threat. The invasion of the Darklings.\r\nCall of Dragons has a lot going up on its plate, starting with the city building aspect. At the outset, players have to choose between three main factions representing the three main races aforementioned above.\r\nSince you can create multiple characters in different servers, I was able to play two factions at once. I chose the elven faction and the human factions. They are visually and audibly distinct from each other with different buildings and voice acting, but most of the gameplay elements, even the story, are the same.\r\nThe main gameplay loop focuses on upgrading the City Hall. Upgrading such buildings will require the prerequisite building and levels, plus a specific amount of resources. And these resources are in turn generated and rewarded by the game through various production buildings and tasks.\r\nThe base-building element is pretty time consuming, and players will need to wait out hours, days even, for some buildings to complete. Giving players something to look for and constantly check for in a day to day manner. You can only construct or upgrade one building at a time, or more depending on the number of builders that you have. I also loved how you can reposition buildings without a hassle, not even costing anything.\r\nIt’s a pretty overwhelming system, but this has been made easier by a commendable user interface, clearly identifying what buildings or levels are needed. Tracking down what needs to be upgraded is possible with just a few convenient touches.\r\nOf course, with the city building aspect comes the need to defend it and attack others as well. That’s where the army management aspect comes in. Different structures can train different troops, and you can assign heroes to lead them.\r\nHeroes come in many forms: mages, warriors, etc. Coming from across all races and can be leveled up in an RPG fashion, complete with a skill tree and talent system. Heroes can be obtained in a gacha manner by either grinding or in-game purchase to open chests .\r\nThe battles play out automatically with minor interventions, mostly in the form of moving units and activating skills. Troop composition and strength is what mostly matters. Like Rise of Kingdoms, what makes Call of Dragons much more unique from the rest of the online RPG strategy games out there is that players' troops and units can freely travel across the land, not only attack, defend, or directly interact with specific points of interest.\r\nAt first, there’s more than plenty enough of everything to get players started, it will feel like you’re on a cheat code with unlimited resources and currency. Everything is just a time-investment during the early parts, with all the timers players wait for upgrades are in progress.\r\nHowever, once players approach mid-game, Call of Dragons slowly starts depriving them of the basic necessities, steadily leading to more grinding, and gradually implanting dependency to the gacha mechanics. Sooner or later, players are now considering paying to progress faster.\r\nThe online world map is so big, and I mean big. It will take players literal months, or even years, to even get to the farthest points, and I’m not even talking about fully exploring it, which is just basically impractical.\r\nWhile it is so big, they came up short with the zooming in aspect — the units are too small to see in all its glory. however the game was indeed designed to show hundreds of battles at once, so that may be a necessary compromise.\r\nThere is a story that players can follow, which picks up where the introduction left. 4 sets of stories to play and each divided into many different parts. From what I can see, it’s a pretty standalone experience from the rest of the gameplay, one that is optional.\r\nAside from the story, you can also take part in a series of around 80 increasingly difficult battle missions via the “Dragon Trail”. The premise is relatively simple, just defeat the enemies in combat, and get rewards. Giving players something cool to do, especially when waiting and there’s nothing else to do in the city-building aspect.\r\nMultiplayer is also highly integrated within Call of Dragons that takes the game into another level of fun. Players can form alliances and participate in alliance research, wars, and team ups with other co-members. Players will also receive various alliance bonuses such as additional resources and donations/helps. If you have friends to play with in this game, the fun factor is easily doubled.\r\nAs for the presentation, the voice acting is top-notch, everything in this game speaks high production values, including the CGI-looking in-game graphics and cinematics. You can tell that the developers and artists took great care in crafting this beautiful game. My only gripe, as said earlier, is that the units are too small and you cannot zoom in very close to the action.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4758122) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dark Season is an RPG mobile game with a mix of dungeon crawling, rogue-lite, and bullet-hell elements, sprinkled with a bit of gacha gaming.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Challenging combat\r\n- Engaging game mechanics## Cons\r\n-Playtime is heavily limiting\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nNo english version so far\r\nDark Season is a brand new one-handed play mobile game currently available on Android, only in the Korean Language, an unfortunate news for international players. Barring some language barriers, it is still highly playable and the game is easy to understand.\r\nThe world of Dark Season is a weird one. A cross between medieval fantasy and a modern setting, and a realm populated by various magical beings. It’s pretty weird seeing guns, tanks, drones, and computers in a medieval looking setting alongside magic portals and mystical beings, but that’s how the game is.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nPlayers control a lone hunter, battling various different monsters across over 70 stages, with three levels per stage and nine areas per level (70 stages - 3 levels each  - 9 areas each) There are 26 different weapons that players can unlock and play with. It combines aspects of the dungeon crawling, rogue-lite, and bullet-hell genre; and crossbreeds a game that is both challenging and thrilling to play.\r\nDark Season is not an easy game, in fact the difficulty is immediately evident even in the first ever level. It will test players' abilities to effectively dodge incoming projectiles and enemy attacks, while trying to come up with their own attacks. What’s impressive is, this depth of combat is all done with just one-hand.\r\nAttacks are determined by the character’s two weapons, randomized from a pool of unlocked weapons upon entering a level. At first, players start with only two, and subsequently unlock more weapons every two stages or so. This continues up to the very end of the game, giving players something to look forward to throughout the entirety of the experience.\r\nThe type of weapon determines the attack mechanics, which boils down to two main categories. Melee and Ranged, Ranged attacks are deadly and tactical, but require a standstill to automatically fire upon the closest enemy. Melee attacks can cleave and activate even while moving, but you need to be up close and personal with the enemy.\r\nThe enemies on the other hand all have different attack patterns and behavior, with over 30 types of enemies to encounter, not counting the various bosses as well. The nature of attacks are very creatively varied, some using a plain melee attack, some shooting projectiles with differing patterns, some are burrowing in the ground or teleporting around, some are splitting into more forms upon death.\r\nFairly challenging\r\nDark Season is challenging, yes, but it is fairly balanced. Amidst all the bullet-hell clutter and the barrage of enemy attacks, everything still is properly cued visually to the player. Giving players the right amount of time and proper cue to evade attacks. It never felt unfair, but make no mistake, it is unforgiving.\r\nThe rogue-lite nature exists in the form of temporary character bonuses, where every once in a while, when players clear an area, a choice is presented to them. It’s either focus on your attacks, or defense, or a little bit of both. Once the level ends, the bonus disappears. However, progression for both the characters' levels and the stages are retained and do not reset upon death.\r\nThe gacha mechanics\r\nAn added challenge is introduced because the game is heavily limiting due to a restrictive time-currency/energy feature. So you only have very limited tries before you run out of energy and have to wait again so you cannot binge-play this game to completion, a typical gacha game element, but one that I find doesn’t go well with the fun dungeon crawling nature of the game, at least no in its current state. I want to play more and try more levels!\r\nAs players progress throughout the game, they will unlock more characters to play and level up; and more rewarding gameplay elements to tinker with.\r\nSome of these elements include a mini-challenge system that grants rewards upon completion of a required conditions, collecting some magic eggs to hatch in 30 minutes, again giving rewards to the player, and collecting some keys to open loot chests. As with gacha mechanics, everything can be skipped/quickened by spending some cash.\r\nOn the technical side, the graphics look charming and are of cel-shaded anime design. The animations are decent and the game overall feels solid to control, especially with the one-handed control scheme. The hits to enemies feels good and the different enemies and attack effects are all visually distinct. However, I’ve encountered some very minor targeting issues, there are moments where the character isn’t firing at enemies for no discernable reason.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4758248) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "From the makers of the popular strategy game Rise of Kingdoms, comes another similar game with a new fresh coat of paint, Call of Dragons.\r\nFeaturing Orcs, Humans, Elves — Rise of Kingdoms just got a Lord of the Rings makeover. These three races have been at war for the longest time, until the arrival of a universal threat. The invasion of the Darklings.\r\nCall of Dragons has a lot going up on its plate, starting with the city building aspect. At the outset, players have to choose between three main factions representing the three main races aforementioned above.\r\nThe main gameplay loop focuses on upgrading the City Hall. Upgrading such buildings will require the prerequisite building and levels, plus a specific amount of resources. And these resources are in turn generated and rewarded by the game through various production buildings and tasks.\r\nOf course, with the city building aspect comes the need to defend it and attack others as well. That’s where the army management aspect comes in. Different structures can train different troops, and you can assign heroes to lead them.\r\nHeroes come in many forms: mages, warriors, etc. Coming from across all races and can be leveled up in an RPG fashion, complete with a skill tree and talent system. Heroes can be obtained in a gacha manner by either grinding or in-game purchase to open chests .\r\nThe battles play out automatically with minor interventions, mostly in the form of moving units and activating skills. Troop composition and strength is what mostly matters.\r\nAt first, there’s more than plenty enough of everything to get players started, it will feel like you’re on a cheat code with unlimited resources and currency. For now, everything is just a time-investment, with all the timers players wait for upgrades are in progress. The timers start out pretty generously, only taking a few seconds, then eventually minutes and hours.\r\nThe online world map is so big, and I mean big. It will take players literal months, or even years, to even get to the farthest points, and I’m not even talking about fully exploring it, which is just basically impractical. There is a story that players can follow, which picks up where the introduction left. From what I can see, it’s a pretty standalone experience from the rest of the gameplay, one that is optional.\r\nMultiplayer is also highly integrated within Call of Dragons that takes the game into another level of fun. Players can form alliances and participate in alliance research, wars, and team ups with other co-members. Players will also receive various alliance bonuses such as additional resources and donations/helps. If you have friends to play with in this game, the fun factor is easily doubled.\r\nAs for the presentation, the voice acting is top-notch, everything in this game speaks high production values, including the CGI-looking in-game graphics and cinematics. You can tell that the developers and artists took great care in crafting this beautiful game.\r\nSo far I've had an amazing first impression of Call of Dragons, even at its fresh state, the game already packs a lot of content that can keep players busy for a long, long time. It's a highly promising game that I hope gets even better as it ages.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4755035) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Rumble Heroes : Adventure RPG is a free-to-play mobile RPG where players control a ragtag team of heroes looking to save the princess.\r\n## Pros\r\n- simple but fun one-handed gameplay\r\n- interesting adventure RPG elements## Cons\r\n-combat lacks depth\r\n-heavy amounts of grind needed, unless you pay\r\nRumble Heroes’s gameplay is similar to Vampire Survivors; you only control using one hand and you only control movement of the characters, nothing else. However it adds more complexity and depth to the game by introducing various adventure RPG concepts: Traversing through the land, encountering different characters, building your party, and resting in camps and villages.\r\nThe graphics are goofy and somewhat cute, but the animations are really well-done and accentuates the gameplay even more with its fluid-looking swings, slashes, and death animations.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe combat is fun and satisfying for the most part that compels me enough to play, and it does it without requiring any effort from the player. Unlike other single-handed games, the character instead auto attacks only when not moving, adding a distinct tactical flavor to the combat that players may or may not like.  Players just have to bring the party within attack range, stop moving, and they will automatically bash and hit their enemies to death.\r\nHowever, it becomes clear that this is a trade-off for some proper skill-based combat, as there is no way to handle enemy attacks but to mostly brute force tank them. There isn’t even a way to reliably control which character goes in front and gets damaged. So if you’re looking for a game that is deep on the active combat mechanics, this is not it.\r\nWhen heroes die, they become incapacitated for a few seconds and a cooldown starts before they can get up again back to full health. A pretty straightforward and player friendly feature as to not overly complicate things. After all, Rumble Heroes was designed to be played with one-hand.\r\nPlayers generally control multiple characters at once, and gather more characters to choose from along the way. Or sometimes, in a gacha-like recruitment system. There are many different heroes to gain, from simple axe-wielding joes to full-on rogues and mages.  This group/horde movement scheme is designed to be simple and easy to control, but there are some minor pathing and navigation issues because you do not have an exact positional control of the characters.\r\nIn Rumble Heroes, progression is tied to the series of increasingly difficult areas in the world — all can be traveled to seamlessly — requiring you to upgrade your characters and level them up to be able to withstand further locations. Players will encounter dungeons and quests along the way that gives players another excuse to kill monsters. The dungeons are wave-like and require players to clear all enemies, one level after the next. There are bosses in both the world and dungeons, providing a hefty challenge to players.\r\nThe quests are only barebones, with characters mostly requiring some sort of resource in exchange for a reward. Speaking of barebones, this is the same case with the plot where the only takeaway I got was that I have to save some princess. No cutscenes, no cinematics.\r\nFurther adding to the already gameplay rich world, there is a bit of resource gathering and minor base building elements while exploring the land, sometimes requiring you to gather wood, meat, and minerals, to be able to perform different actions like activating new structures, revealing locked zones, completing quests, recruiting heroes from the pub, and upgrading them.\r\nBase building elements take the form of gradually upgrading your village using resources that will unlock new features, like a pub to recruit new heroes, or a dungeon portal to serve as a dungeon-crawling replayable section.  In the game world, loot chests are also encountered from time to time that grants you resources, with the option of watching an ad to further multiply the loot gained.\r\nAs for the free-to-play elements, there are indeed microtransactions where you can spend money to level up faster and recruit better characters. For the early game, it never felt like there was a pay-to-win element. Unfortunately, this is not the same case a few hours in, and players will soon hit a wall that will make them grind, or encouraged to pay.\r\nOutside the pay-to-win mechanics, all of these gameplay elements result in a rather engaging dynamic system that seamlessly switches from killing monsters, bosses, to gathering resources and building structures, on a whim.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4757983) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dark Season is a brand new RPG mobile game designed for one-handed play. It is currently available on Android only in the Korean Language, an unfortunate news for international players. But barring some language barriers, it is still highly playable and the game is easy to understand.\r\nThe world of Dark Season is a weird one. A cross between medieval fantasy and a modern setting, and a realm populated by various magical beings. It’s pretty weird seeing guns, tanks, drones, and computers in a medieval looking setting alongside magic portals and mystical beings, but that’s how the game is.\r\nPlayers control a lone hunter, battling various different monsters across over 70 stages, with three levels per stage and nine areas per level (70 stages - 3 levels each  - 9 areas each). Players will be given a two random weapons amongst 26 different choices that players can unlock and play with. It combines aspects of the dungeon crawling, rogue-lite, and bullet-hell genre; and crossbreeds a game that is both challenging and thrilling to play.\r\nDark Season is not an easy game, in fact the difficulty is immediately evident even in the first ever level. It will test players' abilities to effectively dodge incoming projectiles and enemy attacks, while trying to come up with their own attacks. What’s impressive is, this depth of combat is all done with just one-hand.\r\nDark Season is challenging, yes, but it is fairly balanced. Amidst all the bullet-hell clutter and the barrage of enemy attacks, everything still is properly cued visually to the player. Giving players the right amount of time and proper cue to evade attacks. It never felt unfair, but make no mistake, it is unforgiving.\r\nThe rogue-lite nature exists in the form of temporary character bonuses, where every once in a while, when players clear an area, a choice is presented to them. It’s either focus on your attacks, or defense, or a little bit of both. Once the level ends, the bonus disappears.\r\nHowever, progression for both the characters' levels and the stages are retained and do not reset upon death. As players progress throughout the levels, they will unlock more characters to play and level up; and more rewarding gameplay elements to tinker with.\r\nTo wrap things up, Dark Season has made a good first impression on me. The game is challenging, thrilling, and fun to play. The combat is fun, and I like many of the systems in place. I just wish they could tweak the time currency a bit so I could play more frequently.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4756179) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Setting players up with starting cash, computer hardware, and a custom hacking OS which will be the main GUI of the game — slightly customizable by the way — via themes and wallpaper. The background music is a bit too cringey for me, but you can turn that off if you wish.\r\nPlayers will select a starting location from a selection of various cities, countries, from all continents. After that, players are placed in a 3D scaled down version of the city they’ve picked, and they can move from one building to the other, or even move to other countries to access different networks. As for what to do next, it’s entirely up to the players to decide on what to do next. There is no story, no plot, the game is purely sandbox\r\nPlayers can follow the tutorial missions, which does set up the gameplay mechanics nicely despite being initially confusing, and gives players bonuses as well for completing them. However, this is not mandatory and players can figure things out on their own.\r\nPlayers start off with the entry point — by entering wifi and network systems. Once “in”, they can now see the different devices connected to the network. Players can’t outright do anything yet, as they have to acquire the necessary hacking software to proceed further. Even with wifi networks, you need specific software/hardware to be able to crack more secure networks.\r\nFortunately, The Agency has provided you with a software store wherein you can buy all these different tools. WEP Wifi security? Buy a WEP cracker. Need to hack a router? Buy a router exploit. Hack a basic computer? A web browser exploit will do the job.\r\nIt’s a nice element that requires a much needed input from the player, since the actual “hacking” is done automatically. There are minimal puzzle mini-games, and it does get repetitive, especially the early parts of trying to get into networks and hacking simple devices.\r\nThe entire gameplay cycle revolves around hacking devices, earning cash, and then using that cash to acquire more advanced software and hardware to be able to hack into more advanced devices and networks. It’s a simple concept, but highly addicting. It’s probably dopamine-pumping the same parts of the brain as with real-life hackers.\r\nThe Lonely Hacker doesn’t require much input from the player, and when it does, it can feel repetitive. But for what it depicts, the game is highly immersive and addictive. If the players let it immerse them, they will really feel like a true hacker doing cybercrime from their mobile phones, and it’s just fun to continuously hack and hack various devices across the world. The gamified GUI does slightly take away that immersion a little bit, but it’s probably there to remind you that it’s just a video game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4769344) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The lone developer, “The Lonely Developer\", probably got tired of all the ridiculous and unrealistic depictions of Hacking across all mediums; keyboard mashing scenes in Hollywood movies, cute puzzles in video games, and the age old saying “I’m in”. And that pushed him to create this surprisingly fun game.\r\nOf course, some liberties had to be made. The hacking is made easier, faster, and safe. The softwares and hardwares are simplified. The money is easy to come by. Everything else, The Lonely Hacker has got it right.\r\nThe Lonely Hacker hits all the right notes when it comes to the depiction of how hacking is done in real life.

However, this is not mandatory and players can figure things out on their own.\r\nThe whole gist of The Lonely Hacker centers around players hacking different computers around the world; stealing data, planting viruses, mining bitcoin, taking control of computers, and many other real-life cybercrimes.\r\nPlayers start off with the entry point — by entering wifi and network systems. Once “in”, they can now see the different devices connected to the network. Players can’t outright do anything yet, as they have to acquire the necessary hacking software to proceed further. Even with wifi networks, you need specific software/hardware to be able to crack more secure networks.\r\nFortunately, The Agency has provided you with a software store wherein you can buy all these different tools.

There are minimal puzzle mini-games, and it does get repetitive, especially the early parts of trying to get into networks and hacking simple devices.\r\nOther devices and wifi networks on the other hand will require much more than just software solutions. Which will require you to upgrade your hardware and/or leverage the computing power of infected computers across the web.\r\nOnce the exploit works and the device is vulnerable, we’re into the main event now, which is manipulating the actual device. Again, you need to buy all these “Post Exploit” softwares to be able to do anything. Keyloggers, Bitcoin mining, and Botnet to take control of the computer and make it part of a hive. Acquiring data such as credit card info, user credentials, email accounts, and other useful information can be sold online.\r\nAdding to the immersion, you have to find the person selling them in chat groups and participate in a simulated chat to sell these stolen information online, luckily you can automate the selling once you’ve done it the first time. You can also convert mined bitcoins into cash as an additional cash flow.\r\nThe entire gameplay cycle revolves around hacking devices, earning cash, and then using that cash to acquire more advanced software and hardware to be able to hack into more advanced devices and networks. It’s a simple concept, but highly addicting. It’s probably dopamine-pumping the same parts of the brain as with real-life hackers.\r\nNot everything has to be done in a sandbox manner though, as players can take on missions given by The Agency to partake in more specific tasks, including DDOS (Denial of Service) attacks, Ransomwares, and File deletion contracts. If all the computers in the vicinity are hacked, you can move on to another building, or even other cities or countries.\r\nThe Lonely Hacker doesn’t require much input from the player, and when it does, it can feel repetitive, but for what it depicts, the game is highly immersive and addictive. If the players let it immerse them, they will really feel like a true hacker doing cybercrime from their mobile phones, and it is just fun to continuously hack and hack various devices across the world.

    "body": "Cyber Protocol is an cyberpunk arcade puzzle game with a high degree of difficulty and hardcore elements. It is currently available for iOS, PC, Xbox, and Switch, but this article will be focusing on the recently released iOS version.\r\nThe main goal of Cyber Protocol is to reach the ends of the level by any means necessary, however there is an added layer of challenge for those completionists and hardcore gamers who are looking for more. The levels are all timed, all the collected white dots — similar to Pac-Man — are counted as scores, and the amount of deaths players make are counted too, all resulting in a high score at the end of the levels.\r\nEven if you ignore these optional challenges, it's still a hard game. Cyber Protocol presents players with many different obstacles within the levels that will require creative and logical thinking, as well as fast fingers to do some frantic maneuvering. Laser beams, roaming hazards, “fire” walls, exploding tiles (like bomberman), and many more hazards are put in-between the player and the exit point.\r\nPlayer cannot just rely on pure skill and reaction time, as most of the puzzles require keen observation and planning in order to pass through. Sometimes players can get lucky by frantically sliding random directions, but that almost never works for the entirety of the levels, as as soon as you die without a checkpoint, you reset from way to the start of the level anyway.\r\nFor the hardcore completionists, it means studying, replaying, and practicing every single level (all 100 of them) for a long, long time, before doing an “official” run to achieve a top score. And if that wasn’t enough, there is a separate mode called Arcade where the pace is increased, lives are limited, and there is a top 20 global leaderboard to conquer.\r\nPresentation wise, the 2D graphics, neon-lit art style, CRT retro filter, and 8 bit techno soundtrack are nice enough and fits the cyberpunk-hacking theme it is going for. It just needs one-hand to play, but only plays at landscape orientation.\r\nSo far I find it fun and challenging, however the difficulty is not something that I think everyone would like.

Built under the guise of a simple hacking sliding mini-game, Cyber Protocol is much more than it meets the eye. It is frantic, hardcore, and unforgiving.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Challenging puzzles and levels\r\n- Lit 2D cyberpunk art style and techno soundtrack## Cons\r\n-Difficulty is not for everyone\r\n-Controls are inconsistent\r\nFresh from my review of another hacking themed game, today we have another game in Cyber Protocol, this time it’s far from being a realistic hacking simulation, rather it is an arcade puzzle game with a high degree of difficulty and hardcore elements. It is currently available for iOS, PC, Xbox, and Switch, but this article will be focusing on the recently released iOS version.\r\nreview of another hacking themed game\r\nIt looks like Pac-Man — yes, you also eat white dots on a maze-like map — yes. But that’s just about where the comparison ends. Cyber Protocol is instead basically a spiritual successor to the puzzle game Tomb Of The Mask, where the gameplay setup is almost exactly the same.\r\nSet in a cyberpunk world, players assume the role of a hacker, trying to “reactivate” his recently deceased friend by activating the titular Cyber Protocol via a hack. The gameplay is easy to learn, but hard to master. Players just need to slide in any of the four directions in order to proceed. What’s hard is navigating around the various unique puzzle-filled levels and getting past the obstacles.\r\nThe main goal is to reach the ends of the level by any means necessary, however there is an added layer of challenge for those completionists and hardcore gamers who are looking for more. The levels are all timed, all the collected white dots — similar to Pac-Man — are counted as scores, and the amount of deaths players make are counted too, all resulting in a high score at the end of the levels. You can absolutely ignore these aspects and just focus on the exit point, but then it's hard to ignore these added challenges. You almost always want to collect all points, never die, and do it as fast as possible.\r\nEven if you ignore these optional challenges, it's still a hard game. Cyber Protocol presents players with many different obstacles within the levels that will require creative and logical thinking, as well as fast fingers to do some frantic maneuvering. Laser beams, roaming hazards, “fire” walls, exploding tiles (like bomberman), and many more hazards are put in-between the player and the exit point.\r\nPlayers can fail and die an infinite number of times, but they’d have to completely reset the level from scratch, unless they activate a checkpoint at certain points within the levels. This can lead to some frustrations and intense memorization moments in order to beat some segments, especially when dying near a checkpoint or an exit point, after almost making it.\r\nThis trend continues throughout the 100 unique levels that will really test the players’ puzzle solving skills and patience. Even in the first few levels, the game is already hard enough. The more the players go deeper into the levels, new obstacles and gameplay elements are introduced that will further test their resolve.\r\nPlayer cannot just rely on pure skill and reaction time, as most of the puzzles require keen observation and planning in order to pass through. Sometimes players can get lucky by frantically sliding random directions, but that almost never works for the entirety of the levels, as as soon as you die without a checkpoint, you reset from way to the start of the level anyway.\r\nFor the hardcore completionists, it means studying, replaying, and practicing every single level (all 100 of them) for a long, long time, before doing an “official” run to achieve a top score. And if that wasn’t enough, there is a separate mode called Arcade where the pace is increased, lives are limited, and there is a top 20 global leaderboard to conquer.\r\nWhile the console and PC versions included a local / split-screen multiplayer mode where you can complete the levels at the same time and try for the best high-score, the iOS version does not include this and is instead a full single-player experience. It is much cheaper though as it is only half the price at $4.99.\r\nPresentation wise, the 2D graphics, neon-lit art style, CRT retro filter, and 8 bit techno soundtrack are nice enough and fits the cyberpunk-hacking theme it is going for. It just needs one-hand to play, but only plays at landscape orientation.\r\nThe controls aren’t 100% consistent in my experience, there are times that the game missed some of the inputs I was trying to make, resulting in failures and mishaps while excitedly sliding throughout the levels. It has something to do with how movement speed is handled with regards to distance, It's not constant unlike in Tomb of the Mask.\r\nSo far I find it fun and challenging, however the difficulty is not something that I think everyone would like. In the first few levels, it is already hard enough, what more for the latter parts of it? At a cheap price of $4.99, it doesn’t hurt much to try though.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4795790) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "As someone who never played the 90s classics during its heyday but have played, watched, and experienced them as a “retro” game status throughout the recent years, It is quite a delight to finally play the beat 'em up game Streets of Rage 4, the latest installment in the Streets of Rage series after almost 30 years of hiatus.\r\nOne of the first things that struck me about Streets of Rage 4 was the art style. The game features hand-drawn graphics with super vibrant colors and detailed backgrounds that are a true delight for the eyes. The character designs are faithful to the original games while also adding some new HD vibrant touches to keep things fresh and pleasing. Each character has their own unique style, fighting moves, and they all look striking in action.\r\nThe gameplay in Streets of Rage 4 is smooth and satisfying as far as retro beat ‘em ups go. Players can choose from a variety of characters — starting for four available — each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The combat system is simple to learn but has enough depth to keep things interesting, with a variety of specific moves and combos to master. The game also features a range of breakable weapons and items that players and enemies alike can pick up and use to devastating effect, adding to the fun and chaos.\r\nWhile there are plenty of callbacks to the original games, such as familiar enemies and environments, the game also introduces new elements. For example, some levels feature interactive elements such as cars that players can use as weapons or obstacles to take cover behind. The game also introduces new enemies with attack patterns and abilities, keeping players on their toes.\r\nIn terms of difficulty, Streets of Rage 4 strikes a good balance between cakewalk-easy and frustratingly unforgiving. The game starts off relatively simple, allowing players to get used to the combat system and mechanics. However, as the game progresses, the challenge ramps up considerably, with tougher, numerous enemies; more unpredictable attacks, and more complex levels. It's a satisfying progression that keeps players engaged without feeling overwhelming.\r\nThere are multiple game modes in Streets of Rage 4, but the flagship feature is definitely the Story Mode, where players progress through 12 succeeding stages together with a unique boss fight at the end of the stages. At every stage clear, the amount of lives you have resets, making it highly accessible and not too frustrating. Players also have the option to heal their current health points by picking up food items on the ground.\r\nThe game also includes a range of unlockable content and hidden secrets to keep players on the lookout. There are additional characters to unlock (more with the DLC), as well as a range of alternate retro costumes and hidden levels. The game also features online co-op , allowing players to team up with friends for some chaotic beat 'em up action. (originally not present, but was added in an updated last year)\r\nSo far, Streets of Rage 4 is looking like one of the better premium beat 'em up games to come out on mobile, if not currently the best. If you're looking for a no non-sense gameplay, no pay-to-win or grinding elements, and non-stop action, this might be the ideal game to check out.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4809617) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Evertale would probably be an accurate game to show as an example if somebody asked the question, What If Pokemon and Final Fantasy had a child and released it on mobile platforms?\r\nEvertale is a JRPG turn-based combat game that draws heavy inspiration from the Pokemon series of video games, by featuring monster and character collecting aspects, packaged in a gacha gaming manner.\r\nThe game features a proper narratively-driven progression that one would expect in a JRPG game. Nothing too fancy, the players control the main character Finn, a special young warrior that was caught in a nightmarish event called The Pandemonium — where monsters go berserk and come to terrorize the land of Erden. This has only occurred once every 100 years, but there is a big new problem: the last Pandemonium only happened only 18 years ago. It’s up to the player to form a ragtag team of monsters and characters to stop The Pandemonium once and for all.\r\nThe gameplay premise revolves around capturing and training monsters and cute waifu characters to form a powerful team that can take on various demons and monsters in the game. Over 200 monsters and characters  — all unique and have their own moves, attacks, strengths, and artwork — can be collected. Players can evolve these monsters and level up these characters to create a team that best suits their playstyle and strategy.\r\nAs for the combat mechanics, it has a turn-based combat system with a welcome change to how the turns work. Each move or attack has a certain weight to it (called TU), and this will affect character placement for the next turn.\r\nEach character and monster has their own set of skills and attacks, but some skills do overlap with each other, sometimes even giving way to some character skill combos with the right lineup. The actual combat is surprisingly strategic and well balanced, and the battle momentum can easily swing to any side at any time, depending on your turn-by-turn decision making.\r\nPlayers can assign and build their own party lineup, up to four at a time with four more reinforcements in reserve that can substitute for any downed characters, who are effectively incapacitated for the rest of the battle. HP is reset for every battle instance, so no survival elements to worry about.\r\nThe game is very forgiving when it comes to defeat, as it allows players to instantly replay the battle and not really return you to a previous checkpoint or save point. In fact, Evertale doesn’t even have a traditional save system. It functions like an online-game where progress is automatically saved, they even have servers that you can log in and other live service game modes like Arena and Alliances. Which brings us to Evertale’s next element: Gacha gaming.\r\nWhile the game is technically a premium game, it’s so cheap or even sometimes free that it effectively is a F2P/P2W game. Players can use in-game currency called Soul Stones or real money to purchase summoning tickets. These tickets allow players to summon monsters, characters, and weapons, with each ticket providing a chance to obtain a random drop of a certain rarity.\r\nEvertale is easy to pick up and so far I’m liking the first few bits of the game. A promising title with innovative gameplay mechanics, compelling story, and a weird identity crisis, torn between being a premium game and a gacha one.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4815033) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Streets of Rage 4 is a side-scrolling retro beat 'em up game that truly captures the essence of the original series while also bringing modern elements to the table.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Beautiful art style and 2D graphics\r\n- Simple but fun gameplay\r\n- Controller Support## Cons\r\n-No cons\r\nAs someone who never played the 90s classics during its heyday but have played, watched, and experienced them as a “retro” game status throughout the recent years, It is quite a delight to finally play Streets of Rage 4, the latest installment in the Streets of Rage series after almost 30 years of hiatus.\r\nStreets of Rage 4 is currently available for PC, Switch, Playstation and Xbox platforms, but has been released for mobile platforms (iOS, Android) as well last year 2022. This article will be focusing on the mobile version, which plays exactly the same as their PC/Console counterparts, save for a touch screen control option.\r\nA beautiful game\r\nOne of the first things that struck me about Streets of Rage 4 was the art style. The game features hand-drawn graphics with super vibrant colors and detailed backgrounds that are a true feast for the eyes. The character designs are faithful to the original games while also adding some new HD vibrant touches to keep things fresh and pleasing to the eyes. Each character has their own unique style, fighting moves, and they all look striking in action.\r\nDespite having a mobile version, Streets of Rage 4 still opted to display at a fixed 16:9 resolution, not fully utilizing mobile phone displays, which are usually at a very wide aspect ratio of 18:9 and above, leaving emulator-style bars at the sides.\r\nThe soundtrack for Streets of Rage 4 is well made and fits the setting quite nicely. It features a range of electronic and techno tracks that are both catchy, atmospheric, and nostalgic for old-timers. The music sets the tone for each level very well, accentuating the brawler-filled action. It's also worth noting that the game includes an option to switch between the original and retro soundtracks, providing a fun nod to fans of the original games.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay in Streets of Rage 4 is smooth and satisfying as far as retro beat ‘em ups go. Players can choose from a variety of characters — starting for four available — each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The combat system is simple to learn but has enough depth to keep things interesting, with a variety of specific moves and combos to master. The game also features a range of breakable weapons and items that players and enemies alike can pick up and use to devastating effect, adding to the fun and chaos.\r\nIts simplicity comes from the characters’ offensive capabilities which just comprises mostly of a singular attack button as the main damage dealer. You can do a power move, at the cost of health points. However, this health point deduction isn’t a final one as long as you don’t get damaged, you can still reclaim the lost HP by doing combos one after another, if you get hit, then the damage is finalized.  Aside from the power move, there is an ultimate move indicated by a Star that does incredible AOE damage and can turn the tide of battle.\r\nWhile there are plenty of callbacks to the original games, such as familiar enemies and environments, the game also introduces new elements. For example, some levels feature interactive elements such as cars that players can use as weapons or obstacles to take cover behind. The game also introduces new enemies with attack patterns and abilities, keeping players on their toes.\r\nAs retro game with retro mechanics, it is still accessible for a modern audience\r\nIn terms of difficulty, Streets of Rage 4 strikes a good balance between cakewalk-easy and frustratingly unforgiving. The game starts off relatively simple, allowing players to get used to the combat system and mechanics. However, as the game progresses, the challenge ramps up considerably, with tougher, numerous enemies; more unpredictable attacks, and more complex levels. It's a satisfying progression that keeps players engaged without feeling overwhelming.\r\nWorry not, as players can definitely decrease the difficulty even more by using the “assist” options, adding more lives and special moves at the expense of reduced score. Perfectly tailored for players who don't care about the scoring system at the end of the stages and just want to experience a fun beat ‘em up gameplay.\r\nA sub-five hour main campaign\r\nThere are multiple game modes in Streets of Rage 4, but the flagship feature is definitely the Story Mode, where players progress through 12 succeeding stages together with a unique boss fight at the end of the stages. At every stage clear, the amount of lives you have resets, making it highly accessible and not too frustrating. Players also have the option to heal their current health points by picking up food items on the ground.\r\nAs with side-scrolling beat ‘em ups, the genre has its own distinct mechanics when it comes to the combat system. Players can easily be swarmed to death if they’re not careful about their position, but can easily cheese this side-scrolling nature to easily avoid many attacks by just moving up or down.\r\nPost-story bonus content\r\nThe other modes are just based on the Story Mode, with Arcade mode being a challenging mode that replicates the experience you would get playing it in an arcade, having limited lives to complete the entirety of the game; and Boss Rush Mode focuses on the playing the boss fights in succession, skipping the entirety of the henchmen levels.\r\nThe game also includes a range of unlockable content and hidden secrets to keep players on the lookout. There are additional characters to unlock (more with the DLC), as well as a range of alternate retro costumes and hidden levels. The game also features online co-op , allowing players to team up with friends for some chaotic beat 'em up action. (originally not present, but was added in an updated last year)\r\nController Support\r\nI also had the luxury of trying out the Android version with my Razer Kishi, and can indeed confirm that the game has proper controller support, complete with correct button prompts and bindings. It’s even more fun to play with physical buttons with these types of games where accuracy and total control is tantamount to success.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4815234) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Vampire Survivors is a 2D survival rogue-lite game that is completely playable with just one hand. Players just need to control the character’s movements, and that’s the whole control scheme of the game. The player character automatically attacks and defends itself against waves of waves of monsters and have to survive as long as they can, usually up to 20 to 30 minutes.\r\nThere is no story or background to it and it instead takes the players straight right into the action. Vampire Survivors may seem like an extremely simple game with its retro 2D graphics that look like it came from the NES era but it’s not, it’s deep, engaging, and challenging enough that it can be highly addicting, especially with the low effort required to keep playing. I can effectively classify it as a brain dead game, in a positive manner.\r\nDespite the automated character attacks and 2D top down view, there are still many layers to this game, especially with the many characters, weapons, and item builds that you can try and experiment with. Each of which completely changes how the game plays and ensures not one run is exactly the same.\r\nAt the start of a run, players are placed in a level filled with random waves of enemies in increasing difficulty and numbers. Characters start with just their basic weapon and empty item slots. Killing monsters will drop gems that when picked up, will give experience points in order for the character to level up.\r\nLeveling up presents players with three randomized item choices, which boils down to two types: either getting an entirely new item (provided that there is an empty slot) or to upgrade an existing one. Random chests dropped by powerful monsters will also give you random drops of an item or a weapon.\r\nThe simple nature of giving players three choices of upgrades every time they level up (characters do level very often in a single run) results in a high permutation of widely different possible builds and combos. Again, providing a lot of versatility, replayability, and progression to the game.\r\nVampire Survivors’ rogue-lite persistent progression comes in the form of character unlocks and PowerUps, both purchased by gold acquired from playing the game. PowerUps mostly increase a specific stat globally for all runs, like an increased cooldown, speed, or health. It can also introduce some gameplay changes like an extra revive, projectile, or even give themselves a handicap by making the enemies a tad bit harder. Players can re-spec at will so they do not have to worry about choosing the wrong upgrades when starting out.\r\nWhile the runs of Vampire Survivors get progressively harder by the minute, it still rewards players regardless if they fail because of persistent unlocks and the very prospect of trying out another build, highly motivating them to play more and more runs and getting them addicted to the already gratifying gameplay loop.\r\nVampire Survivors doesn’t look like a fun game at first sight. People usually get turned off by the retro graphics or the simple gameplay controls, but honestly, it’s much more than it meets the eye. It’s surprisingly addicting and fun, and if you’re going to give any game a chance, this is that game.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Evertale is a JRPG turn-based combat game that draws heavy inspiration from the Pokemon series of video games, by featuring monster and character collecting aspects, packaged in a gacha gaming manner.\r\n## Pros\r\n- innovative gameplay mechanics\r\n- a balanced and challenging combat experience\r\n- good looking visuals and character design\r\n- bonus live service idle-game modes## Cons\r\n-paid gacha game\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\n📝\r\nEnglish localization is available, but the voice-acting is Japanese only\r\nEvertale would probably be an accurate game to show as an example if somebody asked the question, What If Pokemon and Final Fantasy had a child and released it on mobile platforms?\r\nEvertale is game with controls fully designed for touch screen displays, with no D-Pad like navigation nor virtual buttons to press. However, players can move the character in two different ways: via a point-and-click method or a traditional virtual analog stick.\r\nAs for the story, it has a proper narratively-driven progression that one would expect in a JRPG game. Nothing too fancy, the players control the main character Finn, a special young warrior that was caught in a nightmarish event called The Pandemonium — where monsters go berserk and come to terrorize the land of Erden. This has only occurred once every 100 years, but there is a big new problem: the last Pandemonium only happened only 18 years ago. It’s up to the player to form a ragtag team of monsters and characters to stop The Pandemonium once and for all.\r\nThe story setup is divided into different Acts and Chapters and is nicely well paced. It is compelling enough to provide a good match for the gameplay to latch on and keep players interested. While the game can be played in full english text, the character dialogues are fully voiced in the japanese language.\r\nThe art style is also highly detailed for a 2D JRPG game. It's unusual, but the overworld segment packs more detail than the actual battle instance graphics. With a higher fidelity world and a more detailed chibi character design. Way different to the cardboard cut-off looking characters and subtle design of the battle graphics. As a whole visual package, the game looks good overall and feels polished.\r\nThe gameplay premise revolves travelling around an overworld map, towns, and dungeons; around capturing and training monsters and cute waifu characters to form a powerful team that can take on various demons and monsters in the game. Over 200 monsters and characters  — all unique and have their own moves, attacks, strengths, and artwork — can be collected.\r\nPlayers can evolve these monsters and level up these characters to create a team that best suits their playstyle and strategy.\r\nAs for the combat mechanics, it has a turn-based combat system with a welcome change to how the turns work. Each move or attack has a certain weight to it (called TU), and this will affect character placement for the next turn. For example, for a basic move that costs 100 TU and a special attack costs 300 TU, using a special attack will place this character much further back in the queue, way behind other characters who have used a more lower TU. On the other hand, If an enemy uses a 300TU move, you can easily squeeze in 2 or 3 100TU moves before he can attack again.\r\nIt’s initially confusing at first, but it is actually intuitive and genius in design, and I wish more turn-based games — even AAA ones — can adapt this formula. This makes it that different moves and actions have different weights, for example, healing or using basic skills, can cost less and therefore makes your characters more dynamic and flexible when it comes to decision making. While powerful moves are only used sparingly and at the right time. Resulting in an unexpected deeper tactical layer to the combat.\r\nEach character and monster has their own set of skills and attacks, but some skills do overlap with each other, sometimes even giving way to some character skill combos with the right lineup. The actual combat is surprisingly strategic and well balanced, and the battle momentum can easily swing to any side at any time, depending on your turn-by-turn decision making.\r\nPlayers can assign and build their own party lineup, up to four at a time with more reinforcements in reserve that can substitute for any downed characters, who are effectively incapacitated for the rest of the battle. HP is reset for every battle instance, so no survival elements to worry about.\r\nPlayers cannot outright equip all your best fighters in an active team, as players have to balance them because of a weighing system for each character and only a limited amount of max points that players can use. The weapons also play a factor with two classifications, a main category which is a hard lock that determines which type of weapons a character can equip, and a sub categorical soft lock where each character has their own preferred weapon that when equipped, can allow for optimal battle performance.\r\nThe game is very forgiving when it comes to defeat, as it allows players to instantly replay the battle and not really return you to a previous checkpoint or save point. In fact, Evertale doesn’t even have a traditional save system. It functions like an online-game where progress is automatically saved, they even have servers that you can log in. Which brings us to Evertale’s next element: Gacha gaming.\r\nWhile Evertale is technically a premium game, it’s so cheap or even sometimes free that it effectively is a F2P/P2W game. Players can use in-game currency called Soul Stones or real money to purchase summoning tickets. These tickets allow players to summon monsters, characters, and weapons, with each ticket providing a chance to obtain a random drop of a certain rarity.\r\nThe rarity of a drop determines its strength and rarity in the game. There are different levels of rarity in Evertale, ranging from common to legendary. Legendary characters or weapons are the rarest and most powerful, and they often have unique abilities that can turn the tide of a battle.\r\nPlayers can also earn summoning tickets by completing various quests, challenges, and events in the game. This provides players with a way to obtain new monsters without spending real money.\r\nOf course, with gacha gaming, everything is left to the RNG gods, or luck. And it can lead to some frustration and disappointment especially for players who have already spent a considerable amount of money on top of buying the game. As expected, further in the game, the difficulty will increase, encouraging in-app purchases in order to progress more comfortably or face countless hours of grinding. Some powerful summons are time-limited in nature, further adding to the pressure of having to spend real money to progress.\r\nEvertale also has other supplementary game modes such as the Tower of Trial where the players’ party from the main story is picked up and is used for increasingly difficult battles with corresponding rewards. Other game modes range from Arena mode where players can pit their party against others, to an alliance system with clan wars with live service and MMORPG elements.\r\nIn these alternative game modes, the gameplay switches to a more traditional idle game where players don’t need to control anything and just let the battle play itself out, being entirely dependent on the party composition, level, and items.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4820347) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "I got the chance to play the early access beta test of the upcoming game Diablo IV, and my experience with the gameplay has been nothing short of amazing so far. It still looks and plays like a proper Diablo game, with respect to both Diablo II and III.\r\nFirst of all, the visuals of Diablo IV are just beautiful, from the dark fantasy art style perfectly complemented by the immersive lighting system, to the highly detailed and customizable character models. Even the icons and UI elements are superbly designed, with a church-esque stained glass aesthetic going along with it.\r\nFor the gameplay, it still continues the signature explosive and action-packed combat that started with Diablo III, albeit with the dark art style and a deep varied skill tree that is more closer to Diablo II. Players can select any of the five classes to create and customize a character. Level it up, play through the campaign, explore the open world, and acquire better gear. With or without friends, you are placed in a shared instance with other online players.\r\nLeveling characters allows you to accumulate points that can be used to acquire new skills. The system resembles the Diablo II system more so than Diablo III. With a clear choice given to the player on what spells to unlock, prioritize, and focus on. A respec quality of life option like the one in Diablo III however, is available. Allowing you to try out builds and experiment to your heart’s content --- as long as you got the gold. For the purpose of the beta, all respects are temporarily free.\r\nThe combat of Diablo IV is simply gratifying. The fluid movement, responsive controls, and satisfying hits accentuated by thestunning visuals make this game immensely satisfying to play. The fluid gruesome combat system perfected in Diablo III makes a return in Diablo IV and is just as refined as ever. With the addition of some elements such as a dedicated dodge maneuver.\r\nNew to the series, Diablo IV now features a massive open-world aspect to it where the game world outside locations such as towns and the wilderness are in a shared instance with other players and parties, providing emergent multiplayer gameplay opportunities and cooperative activities all across the world map.\r\nNo matter how good the gameplay is, the beta is not quite as smooth as I expected, with minor hiccups on the performance and some minor disconnecting and rubber banding issues with the server. We also get the classic long queueing times brought forth by day one launches.\r\nAs I said, my experience with the Diablo IV beta has been nothing short of amazing so far and Diablo IV is looking like a potential game of the year entry with its seemingly masterful gameplay, visuals, and storytelling. If this level of quality is consistent throughout the whole game, it looks like Diablo IV players are going to get their money’s worth come June.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

The very premise of having to simultaneously control two characters in alternating different modes, plus the varying obstacles that you have to creatively surmount makes this adventure game a solid entry into the genre and a testament to how game franchises shouldn’t be just constricted and walled off by their own usual genre, and can instead try out new things.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4839168) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Teased as a secret chapter in Bayonetta 3, it is a full blown adventure game with a children’s book style approach. It is now available for the Nintendo Switch as an exclusive, following Bayonetta 2 and 3.\r\nFrom Action to Art\r\nBayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon’s art style, soundtrack, are accordingly tailored as a children’s book presentation. It features hand-drawn watercolor-esque artwork rendered in vibrant cel-shaded graphics, while the soundtrack is a mix of whimsical, lighthearted, with a faint touch of Bayonetta’s music style.\r\nAnd they’re not just going for a children’s book aesthetic, the game’s story is literally told as one, jumping back and forth between live gameplay and literal book pages to tell the story. These pages are sometimes animated and are narrated by an amazing voice actor who helps sell the children’s tale vibe.\r\nBefore badass, there was cute\r\nBayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, or Bayonetta Origins for short, tells the story of the girl Cereza — the main character of the series — also known as Bayonetta later on, many, many years before the events of the trilogy. It shows a never before seen part of her life and her struggles as an outcast Witch due to the nature of his parents. At the start of the story, she accidentally brings a Demon to their world and it becomes her companion, hence the title of the story.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay is a far departure from the hack-and-slash stylish intense action of the trilogy and instead a classic puzzling adventure game with modern 3D controls. It still has combat, but not anywhere close to the action-packed combat that we’ve known.\r\nPlayers control the two eponymous characters — Cereza and the Lost Demon — simultaneously, Cereza using the left stick and two left bumpers, while the Demon — named Cheshire — is controlled using the right stick and two right bumpers.\r\nIf you think this control scheme is a familiar one, then you might have played something similar before in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, both games are coop experiences designed to be played in singleplayer. Players control two characters at once, and while it is possible to play this with two players, the game isn’t optimally designed as such.\r\nThere are two main modes to the controls, since Cheshire is bound to a doll, he can return to it at will and be carried by Cereza in a Hug mode form. While Cereza is in charge of the two’s movements, you can still control Cheshire in this mode, by extending his body from Cereza to reach stuff out.\r\nOn the other hand, Cereza can summon Cheshire to a full blown demon monster form and both move independently from each other. The seamless alternating change from summoning to returning to the doll reminds me a bit of Pokemon.\r\nA cooperative-singleplayer experience\r\nAs Cereza and Cheshire travel across the enchanted mysterious forest, navigation around various obstacles will require close coordination with each other, such as jump boosts or creating bridges to help the other character cross. At some points, they will be forced to slightly separate and go their own tangential paths, but not too much as Cheshire is magically bound to Cereza and gets weaker if far enough. If they both get too far with each other for too long, the game fails.\r\nCereza possesses a witch magic called Umbran Arts that she can use to alter the environment, manipulate plants, grow them to form bridges, and hold off enemy attacks. She can also do lightweight stuff like crossing thin vine bridges or throwing Cheshire as a doll to reach high ground. Using Umbran Arts requires a bunch of left stick gestures to be performed in order to pull out the spells, however as an accessibility feature, you can make these spells automated, needing just a hold of a button.\r\nCheshire can, on the other hand, do heavyweight and offensive actions such as destroying obstacles, attacking enemies, and throwing Cereze to perform a jump boost.\r\nControlling two characters in a shared screen, especially when separated, can prove to be a difficult task especially with the limited camera controls that players have (since the right stick is reserved for Cheshire), sometimes leading to awkward camera angles that can bring frustration to players.\r\nAside from the kind of slow start, Bayonetta Origins never felt dull during the first few chapters that I’ve played so far, it’s a very engaging experience that is easy to pick up, fun to play, and is varied enough not to feel repetitive. The very premise of having to simultaneously control two characters in alternating different modes, plus the varying obstacles that you have to creatively surmount makes this adventure game a solid entry into the genre and a testament to how game franchise shouldn’t be just constricted and walled off by their own usual genre, and can instead try out new things.\r\nAs players go deeper through the story, Bayonetta Origins incorporates more and more combat to the gameplay. Aside from encountering random hostile plants and enemies across the platforming / puzzling segments, sometimes the game also puts the characters in a sort of Arena combat where waves of enemies attack both Cereza and Cheshire, and you have to survive. There are also occasional traditional boss fights in the game that follows the same arena setup.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4847256) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Diablo IV is an action RPG developed and published by Blizzard, and the fourth game in the critically acclaimed and highly popular Diablo game series. It is scheduled for release on June 6, 2023, with a beta test currently in progress. The early access runs from March 17 to 19, with an open beta available next week March 24-26, free to try for everyone.\r\nI got the chance to play the early access beta test of the upcoming game Diablo IV, and my experience with the gameplay has been nothing short of amazing so far. It still looks and plays like a proper Diablo game, with respect to both Diablo II and III.\r\nBeautiful atmosphere and visuals\r\nFirst of all, the visuals of Diablo IV are just beautiful, from the dark fantasy art style perfectly complemented by the immersive lighting system, to the highly detailed and customizable character models. Even the icons and UI elements are superbly designed, with a church-esque stained glass aesthetic going along with it.\r\nFor comparison, Diablo III at release was not even good looking by 2012 standards. This time, Diablo IV took it to the highest level and brought a visual fidelity worthy of being called a true graphical powerhouse when maxed out, and the requirements aren’t really demanding at the minimum: only needing a 2nd gen i5 and an old GTX 660 to run.\r\nEverything is now in a higher detail, and this also benefits the storytelling a lot. There are now in-game cutscenes that allow the game to tell the story at a more personal level. It gives the developers the ability to do close-ups of the characters without having to resort to either a basic dialogue exchange or a high budget CGI sequence.\r\nThe story takes place thirty years after Diablo III, there was a somewhat peaceful era that is soon now disturbed by the return of Lilith, the demon who created Sanctuary — the world of humans. After having strange visions associated with Lilith's return, the player character pursues Lilith across Sanctuary.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nFor the gameplay, it still continues the signature explosive and action-packed combat that started with Diablo III, albeit with the dark art style and a deep varied skill tree that is closer to Diablo II.\r\nPlayers can select any of the five classes to create and customize a character. Level it up, play through the campaign, explore the open world, and acquire better gear. With or without friends, you are placed in a shared instance with other online players, as well as party up with three other players. Diablo IV also features a global region, crossplay, and cross progression between PC and other consoles, so everyone who owns it in any platform can technically play with each other.\r\nBeta Test schedule\r\nThe early access beta this weekend (March 17 to 19) gives players access to the Barbarian, Sorcerer, and Rogue classes, and can level them up to level 25 and finish up to Act I. The next round of beta is free for everyone (March 24-26) and will give access to the Druid and Necromancer classes.\r\nLeveling characters allows you to accumulate points that can be used to acquire new skills. The system resembles the Diablo II system more so than Diablo III. With a clear choice given to the player on what spells to unlock, prioritize, and focus on. A respec quality of life option like the one in Diablo III however, is available. Allowing you to try out builds and experiment to your heart’s content — as long as you got the gold. For the purpose of the beta, all respects are temporarily free.\r\nThe skill trees are well designed. It’s not as overly complex as Path of Exile with over a thousand skills to choose from, it just gives players the right amount of abilities to work with. You could tell that the developers took their time and care in crafting these skills to what I would say a pretty engaging and somewhat balanced experience. Quality over quantity.\r\nI've tried playing every alternative out there in search to fill the void that Diablo III left. Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Torchlight, even Diablo Immortal and the recent Diablo II: Resurrected --- Nothing quite matched the explosive kinetic combat and the addicting gameplay loop that Diablo III offered, not until Diablo IV came.\r\nThe combat of Diablo IV is simply gratifying. The fluid movement, responsive controls, and satisfying hits accentuated by the stunning visuals make this game immensely satisfying to play.\r\nThe fluid gruesome combat system perfected in Diablo III makes a return in Diablo IV and is just as refined as ever. With the addition of some elements such as a dedicated dodge maneuver.\r\nNew to the series, Diablo IV now features a massive open-world aspect to it where the game world outside locations such as towns and the wilderness are in a shared instance with other players and parties, providing emergent multiplayer gameplay opportunities and cooperative activities all across the world map.\r\nThe gearing is looking great so far, the stat system resembles the closest to DIablo III, with streamlined stats for each body part slot and colored items indicating their rarity. Looting is done the same way: by killing mobs, opening chests, or as a reward for quests.\r\nThe developers have learned a lot in their 10 years of continuous updates to Diablo III and added many of the quality of life features to their newest game. Legendary affixes can still be infused to characters and items, an auto salvage option, teleporting to friends, a remixed version of the health globe and potion systems, and many more positive improvements.\r\nTechnical Analysis\r\nNo matter how good the gameplay is, the beta is not quite as smooth as I expected, with hiccups on the performance especially in towns, and some minor disconnecting and rubber banding issues with the server. We also get the classic long queueing times brought forth by day one launches\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4844602) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Tumbling Zoo-rock it is a fun cute casual game where animals chase each other, bump each other, and eat each other. Wait, doesn’t this happen in real life too?\r\n## Pros\r\n- Chill game\r\n- Cute simple visuals\r\n- Mechanics are deep for an .io consumption game## Cons\r\n-Limits your play to a few times per day only (unless you pay)\r\n-rudimentary zoo management element\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nAds with rewards\r\nIn-app purchases\r\nTumbling Zoo-rock it, is a consumption game reminiscent of .io games such as agar.io and hole.io where you need to consume food and other players to make yourselves bigger, with the ultimate goal of becoming the biggest player on the map with the most eaten animals by the timer ends.\r\nagar.io\r\nhole.io\r\nThe game basically adopts the same formula and adds some new changes to it that makes players put in more work in order to consume other players. It is currently still under development but the developers have made a demo available for players to try.\r\nYou cannot outright eat other animals if the levels are close enough, but you end up bumping them to drop their “meat” and make them smaller. Other animals with higher levels aren’t always automatically a death sentence as well, because you can attack them from the sides and bump their “meat” off as well.\r\nPlayers can control different kinds of animals (depending on their choice) that are unlockable via various in-game currencies, and some of them will have a different minor difference like stats and attributes, providing variety and some form of added layer to the consumption game format, some are just pure cosmetic\r\nSome animals run faster, some can recover stamina better, and some can get bigger. All animals also have some abilities that they can use to help close the gap with other animals. Usually it is a pounce move. The system isn’t complicated, you just keep holding the move button and stop holding it to activate the ability, then it cools down for a few seconds before being available again.\r\nTumbling Zoo-rock it also features a skill progression system in the form of Zoo that houses animal pens for different types of animals. I noticed four different kinds of pens that divide the roster of playable animals. Upgrading each pen will result in upgrading the stats and attributes of that animal type. It’s a very rudimentary zoo management element for now, but it's a nice added flavor for the core .io gameplay. All the player's animals will be housed in this pen. Additionally, the pen also earns passive coin income from \"zoo visitors\" the higher the pen levels.\r\nIn this game, Ads are very powerful and a win-win situation for the developers and the players. Some choices have an alternative ad option that provides much more powerful bonuses like the ability to revive on a max level, gaining more gold than usual, or unlocking more playable animals.\r\nAside from ads, players can also purchase some in-game currency to speed up the progression, however I don’t see any reason to spend money in this game, as it is already fun, enjoyable chill experience, provided that you are fine with the play time limiting energy system, where you can only play up to five times per day.\r\nWhile Tumbling Zoo-rock it is simple and fun, wins are not always guaranteed even for experience players. The gameplay is dynamic and considerate enough that players will always have a chance to catch up to higher level players, to even the top player, and big players won't always have the advantage when it comes to eating smaller animals.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4847332) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Vampire Survivors might not seem like a really good nor addictive game judging from the pixel art graphics, but trust me, it is one of the most addicting games that have come out in recent years.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Highly addicting\r\n- Deep gameplay and challenging difficulty\r\n- Mindless fun, can play with just one hand\r\n- Completely free to play with no pay to win mechanics\r\n## Cons\r\n- The basic retro graphics are not for everyone\r\nVampire Survivors is a 2D survival rogue-lite game that is completely playable with just one hand. Players just need to control the character’s movements, and that’s the whole control scheme of the game. The player character automatically attacks and defends itself against waves of waves of monsters and have to survive as long as they can, usually up to 20 to 30 minutes.\r\nIt was initially available for PC as an early access title, but has since expanded into other platforms with ports to Xbox, Android, and iOS platforms. They all are exactly the same games without any major differences, except for the controls and the portrait mode orientation. With the ability to just start a few minutes session anywhere, minimal controls needed, and its light hardware demands, playing it on mobile just seems like the perfect platform for this game.\r\nFor old-timers coming from other platforms, unfortunately there is no cross platform progression currently in place so it's a start from scratch. However the developers have this down in the pipeline as a future feature.\r\nThere is no story or background to it and it instead takes the players straight right into the action. Vampire Survivors may seem like an extremely simple game with its retro 2D graphics that look like it came from the NES era but it’s not, it’s deep, engaging, and challenging enough that it can be highly addicting, especially with the low effort required to keep playing. I can effectively classify it as a brain dead game, in a positive manner.\r\nDespite the automated character attacks and 2D top down view, there are still many layers to this game, especially with the many characters, weapons, and item builds that you can try and experiment with. Each of which completely changes how the game plays and ensures not one run is exactly the same.\r\nThere are many characters you can choose to start runs with, each of them with different starting weapons and unique modifiers like a higher damage output, experience gain, or an added projectile, amongst other examples. There are four starting characters, with many more hidden that you can unlock. Different weapons and items are present in the game that are randomly obtainable during runs in a rogue-lite manner.\r\nUp to a maximum of six weapons and six items can be equipped on each run, and can be further leveled up by acquiring another multiple of the same weapon or item. All of these six equipped weapons are automatically attacking, some more frequently than others, resulting in an amusing fireworks display of a variety of skills and attacks.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nAt the start of a run, players are placed in a level filled with random waves of enemies in increasing difficulty and numbers. Characters start with just their basic weapon and empty item slots. Killing monsters will drop gems that when picked up, will give experience points in order for the character to level up.\r\nLeveling up presents players with three randomized item choices, which boils down to two types: either getting an entirely new item (provided that there is an empty slot) or to upgrade an existing one.\r\nRandom chests dropped by powerful monsters will also give you random drops of an item or a weapon. Players will always look forward for the next level up to be able to choose a new weapon, item or upgrade, and it never gets old.\r\nThe simple nature of giving players three choices of upgrades every time they level up (characters do level very often in a single run) results in a high permutation of widely different possible builds and combos. Again, providing a lot of versatility, replayability, and progression to the game.\r\nThis gameplay loop is highly addicting. Seeing your builds survive longer and longer as you gain more understanding of the game’s mechanics and itemization is immensely satisfying. The weapons and items are relatively well balanced, and players will most likely find a viable build for any of their preferred weapons, items, and characters. \\\r\nVampire Survivors’ rogue-lite persistent progression comes in the form of character unlocks and PowerUps, both purchased by gold acquired from playing the game. PowerUps mostly increase a specific stat globally for all runs, like an increased cooldown, speed, or health. It can also introduce some gameplay changes like an extra revive, projectile, or even give themselves a handicap by making the enemies a tad bit harder. Players can re-spec at will so they do not have to worry about choosing the wrong upgrades when starting out.\r\nThere are also various levels called “stages” that are unlockable, each with their different modifiers and layout. All these stages have four additional unlockable game modes that take these modifiers to the extreme.\r\nThe start of runs can be a bit boring, especially when you are repeatedly dying or re-doing a run. Most of the fun is gravitated towards the mid to late stages of runs, where builds are starting to get fleshed out and eventually its flaws – if any – are exposed.\r\nWhile the runs of Vampire Survivors get progressively harder by the minute, it still rewards players regardless if they fail because of persistent unlocks and the very prospect of trying out another build, highly motivating them to play more and more runs and getting them addicted to the already gratifying gameplay loop.\r\nVampire Survivors is a completely free game, with the only revenue model being in the form of highly commendable non-intrusive ads. Ads that, upon choice, will give you an extra revive or gold upon death — a win-win situation for players and the developers. There is also a very cheap winter themed DLC titled “Legacy of the Moonspell” that introduces new locations, characters, monsters, and items.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nVampire Survivors is a game so great and iconic it created its own genre - the survival one hander rogue-lite genre. A perfect example of graphics doesn’t matter. Even if you’re one who usually cares for graphics in a game, even if you don’t like what you’re seeing from the screenshots and videos, I’d still recommend giving it a try and experiencing it yourself.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4844676) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer survival horror game that has gained immense popularity among gamers since its initial debut in 2016 for PC and consoles. It was later made available for mobile devices in 2020. I tried out the recent revamped mobile version of the game called Dead by Daylight Mobile and had the chance to explore its various features and gameplay.\r\nThe survivors form a team of four players, taken from a pool of a wide selection of characters, and play in third person view. Their goal is to repair all the generators in the map and activate the exit gate to escape. In many things that they do, such as healing, or repairing generators, there are QTE-like skill checks that you need to perform with a high risk-reward element. The whole premise is very simplistic, but is littered with many interesting elements that make the game exciting for both sides as it plays.\r\nThe lone Killer, on the other hand, plays in first person mode. Players can select a killer from a variety of choices, including crossovers of familiar characters taken from popular media, like Pyramid Head from the Silent Hill series, and Sadako from The Ring films. Each killer will have their own ability and playstyle to consider. For example, one killer might have the ability to teleport through walls, and one can turn invisible. Alone, they need to stop the survivors from escaping, and sacrifice them to The Entity by hooking them to posts scattered around the map, long enough for The Entity to claim them.\r\nThe game also has a progression system that rewards players for playing the game and achieving certain milestones. Players earn Bloodpoints for playing matches, which can be used to level up their characters and unlock new perks and abilities.  Both roles have these unlockable perks for each of the characters that will allow players to tailor their characters to suit their preferred playstyle, be it a faster healing rate, improved vision, or increased rewards at the end.\r\nThe progression system gives players a sense of accomplishment and motivates them to keep playing and improving their skills and to try out other characters. Players can also spend money for new characters and cosmetics, but it is entirely optional and the game is fully playable for free.\r\nAnother aspect of the game that I was highly impressed with was the sound design. The audio in the game is excellent, and it adds to the overall atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are realistic, and the background music is eerie and haunting, which helps to create a sense of tension and suspense as you play the game. The audio cues are also well-designed and help players to stay aware of their surroundings, anticipate the killer's movements, and also intensifies the panic experienced by the players when being chased.\r\nPlaying as a survivor, my experience so far has been heart-wrenching and I felt like I was a character in a horror movie trying to survive. Playing as a killer is a power fantasy experience that feels empowering while at the same time a challenging task, taking on four player-controlled survivors all at once. If you love survival horror and multiplayer games, Dead by Daylight Mobile is looking like great combination of the two that you should try.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "A spaceship has crash landed on an unknown planet. A group of survivors emerges from the wreckage. There is no way to repair the ship, leaving no choice but to salvage it for parts and set up a makeshift base.\r\nDream Land is a casual simulation game that deals with four major gameplay elements. Base building, Resource Farming, Exploration, and Combat. All of these four aspects are all done by your team of survivors who in turn have basic necessities that you need to manage like sleep, food, and hygiene, highly reminiscent of popular games like The Sims and Rimworld.\r\nDream Land features a base building element that is anchored by the main structure: Base Management Center, a “Town Hall” of sorts that determines the settlement's base level. Upgrading it will result in more benefits and unlock more construction opportunities for buildings. Players can build walls, doorways, flooring, and many different objects such as workbenches, beds, and other furniture.  There is always an attainable upgrade just around the corner, which makes it very enticing for players to keep coming back for more.\r\nOf course, in order to build structures and upgrade them, players will need resources. This is where the resource gathering comes in. Players can issue commands to the team to take down trees for wood, mine for ores, and pick out fruits and plants. Players are also required to take part in farming or hunting to provide food for the settlement.\r\nExploration for Dream Land comes in two flavors. Exploration around the settlement, where players can hunt, battle marauders, look for resources, and farm. While there is also the “World” exploration that allows players to travel beyond their settlement in an overworld that reminds me of Civilization’s hex tiles and participate in various activities such as enemy raids, looting, and defending important assets in a tower wave defense format.\r\nThe combat, while automated, is nicely presented with potent sound effects and satisfying enemy kills. The combat boils down to the team’s stats, level, and gear, versus the enemies’.\r\nDespite the casual look, the whole game is fully simulated, with each of the player’s commands requiring a survivor to physically execute, running around the settlement every so often. Crafting using the workbench, gathering wood, or building structures will occupy a survivor’s time. Even as simple as moving furniture is done by the survivor. The queuing system works really well and players won’t have to worry about any pathing or queueing issues that may arise from constantly issuing back and forth random commands for the survivors to do.\r\nIn summary, my initial experience with Dream Land has exceeded my expectations. I’ve found it to be a fun base building and simulation game, with interesting exploration elements and an enticing progression system enough to keep players coming back to their settlements for upgrades.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "It looks like DOOM is joining the single touch craze these days by releasing their newest title for the mobile platform — Mighty DOOM. A top down action shooter where players control the mini Slayer, battling mini Demons in an arcade style combat with rogue-lite progression and mission structure.\r\nThe gameplay is simple: using just one hand, control the mini Slayer to avoid enemy attacks and position shots. His regular shots automatically fire, while the secondary weapons and abilities are manually activated.\r\nIn a rogue-lite fashion, players start off with a basic weapon behavior, and proceed to get 3 random choices for upgrades (depending on their weapon equipped) every once and a while once the ability meter fills up. This choice ranges from a simple stat boost such as an increased health or damage; to a more substantial way that changes how the weapons operate, such as adding another projectile, or making bullets bounce out to other enemies. This makes the gameplay a lot more emergent, and can leave the player excited to wait for and choose the next upgrade.\r\nOnce players are a couple of stages in and their weapons are abundantly upgraded, the game is at its best — bullets, missiles and lasers are flying, ricocheting between or piercing through enemies, players are gloriously mowing down groups of mini demons with ease in what seems like a pretty artistic display of fireworks. In Mighty DOOM, beauty is mayhem.\r\nWhen you die, there is a one-time option of continuing the run via an Ad or an in-game currency, after that, players have to reset the whole chapter from start. Not all progression is lost however, as you can upgrade your character, weapons, and gear to get a better chance on the next try.\r\nIn addition to the regular top-down shooter combat, there are also awesome stylish takedowns for regular mobs and bosses alike. Once defeated, regular mobs have a chance to be “staggered” that when approached, instantly triggers a takedown that, like the main games, heals the player.\r\nThere are a total of eight chapters that get progressively harder to complete, and while it is only eight chapters, the game will still take a considerable amount of time to complete even if there are unlimited energies, due to the difficulty spikes per chapter. The resulting game is a challenging one, with the biggest factor being the ability of players to avoid and withstand enemy projectiles and attacks, which in turn is partly augmented by their level and gear.\r\nUltimately, despite being in a different genre and it’s free-to-play nature, Mighty DOOM is still a decent DOOM spin-off to play in small bite sized sessions on a daily manner. The combat and rogue-lite manner makes it fun to play, but don’t expect it to keep you busy for hours.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

Each enemy dies in a single hit and the game seemingly plays infinitely in a singular level, with high scores being the one and only end goal.\r\nDespite the aforementioned simplicity, Thunder Samurai Defend Village is still a challenging game to play and harder to master. You cannot just spam attacks as there is a small window after it that makes you vulnerable, making precision and timing very important. Hitting it too early can lead to being hit by the enemy. At start, you can only afford to get hit once, the next time is a death sentence.\r\nAs you kill more invaders, the frequency and speed of their onslaught increases, reducing the margin of error even more, and almost playing like a rhythm game of sorts. Further into the waves, enemies will even overlap with each other, adding to the confusion. Every few kills or so, it gives you a short break by dividing the enemies into waves, giving players a much needed reprieve from the anxiety-inducing combat.\r\nNo matter how fun it is, Thunder Samurai Defend Village gets repetitive easily after a short while, upgrades are few and far between due to the grindy progression and there are also frequent intrusive ads that you are forced to watch every few runs. But if you love beating high scores and playing as samurais more than anything else, then this game might be a blast.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "The premise of Slenderman RE: Light Edition is that our main character, the Dave Grohl-looking dude named Edward, is sort of a ghost-hunter. He stumbles upon an abandoned building in the woods and comes across a supernatural experience. With his trusty flashlight, he has to find a way out.\r\nThe gameplay of Slenderman RE: Light Edition is about on par with the story. It’s very elementary and it’s almost like some young aspiring developer made it as a school demo or project.\r\nPlayers just move and look around in first person view and interact with objects by looking at them and touching the interact button. There is another button to toggle the flashlight, and that’s just it. No sprinting and stamina mechanics, battery, nor hard time limit like the original game from more than 10 years ago.\r\nSlenderman RE: Light Edition features two game modes, the story, and the mini-games. The story follows Edward in his experience in that abandoned building, while the mini-games follow a classic Slender Man experience, where players are placed in a map of your choice (out of four) and they’d have to collect all the objects in order to win.\r\nThe story is a mediocre experience with almost non-existent adventure game mechanics aside from basically moving around. The interactables like doors, pages, radios, etc are just there to exist and don't provide any valuable gameplay element to the system. The experience feels like a cheap haunted amusement ride where the sensation of being startled and scared is what matters the most over freedom and substance.\r\nAnd it does scare the player, with its creepy surroundings and incessant abuse of screechy and chilling sound effects. However, there is no real danger to the player from a gameplay perspective. Most of the game is just walking around the environment trying to progress.\r\nThere’s not much else to talk about in this game, other than that I was not impressed. Slenderman RE: Light Edition is a game that is supposed to be simple and lightweight, but that doesn't mean the gameplay should be sacrificed.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Dead by Daylight Mobile is an asymmetric 4v1 multiplayer survival horror game where a team of four players must cooperate with each other in order to escape a killer hunting them.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Top-tier multiplayer survival horror\r\n- Console level visuals\r\n- Balanced asymmetric gameplay\r\n- Super sound design## Cons\r\n-No cons\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nFree to play with In-app purchases for cosmetics and progression\r\nController support is half-baked from my experience\r\nDead by Daylight is a multiplayer survival horror game that has gained immense popularity among gamers since its initial debut in 2016 for PC and consoles. It was later made available for mobile devices in 2020. I tried out the revamped mobile version of the game called Dead by Daylight Mobile and had the chance to explore its various features and gameplay.\r\nThe gameplay centers around a group of four players playing in a cooperative setup, against a lone killer who needs to please “The Entity” by sacrificing these four players before they can escape. Dead by Daylight Mobile channels the feel of classic slasher and horror films and encapsulates them into a video game multiplayer package that just simply works.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nIn Dead by Daylight Mobile, you can either queue as a killer or survivor, and in my experience can easily find games on both sides. This is unlike other similar titles where you mostly play as survivors and you only get a slim chance to play the killer. Both roles play way differently from each other, but are well balanced to form an engaging survival horror experience. For newcomers, there is an optional comprehensive beginners tutorial to get players up to speed.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Dead by Daylight is a 4v1 multiplayer game. The game's matchmaking system works well, and players are matched with others of similar skill levels. The game features both quick play, ranked, custom matches, and players can choose to play with friends or join a game with random players. While random play is a viable option, playing with friends (even against friends) is simply just a superior experience of playing it because of better communication and interaction between players.\r\nThe Survivors form a team of four players, taken from a pool of a wide selection of characters, and play in third person view. Their goal is to repair all the generators in the map and activate the exit gate to escape.\r\nIn many things that they do, such as healing, or repairing generators, there are QTE-like skill checks that you need to perform with a high risk-reward element. Success means a faster action, failure means the killer gets alerted to the player’s position.\r\nThey can move around the map faster than the killer, hide in lockers, and bring down pallets to stop the killer in its tracks. The whole premise is very simplistic, but is littered with many interesting elements that make the game exciting for both sides as it plays.\r\nThe lone Killer, on the other hand, plays in first person mode. Players can select a killer from a variety of choices, including crossovers of familiar characters taken from popular media, like Pyramid Head from the Silent Hill series, and Sadako from The Ring films.\r\nEach killer will have their own ability and playstyle to consider. For example, one killer might have the ability to teleport through walls, and one can turn invisible. Alone, they need to stop the survivors from escaping, and sacrifice them to The Entity by hooking them to posts scattered around the map, long enough for The Entity to claim them.\r\nA well balanced match-up\r\nFor balancing purposes, The Killer moves more dramatically than it's Survivor counterparts, in its hubris, it needs to clean the blade before it can attack again. Obstacles laid out by the player are also destroyed via a pretty dramatic animation, and they usually walk or float slowly in a menacing fashion instead of sprinting around to chase. This gameplay mechanic results in an evenly balanced match-up for both the four survivors and the lone killer.\r\nThe game also has a progression system that rewards players for playing the game and achieving certain milestones. Players earn Bloodpoints for playing matches, which can be used to level up their characters and unlock new perks and abilities.  Both roles have these unlockable perks for each of the characters that will allow players to tailor their characters to suit their preferred playstyle, be it a faster healing rate, improved vision, or increased rewards at the end.\r\nThe progression system gives players a sense of accomplishment and motivates them to keep playing and improving their skills and to try out other characters. Players can also spend money for new characters and cosmetics, but it is entirely optional and the game is fully playable for free.\r\nA surprise story, but a welcome one\r\nSince this is primarily a competitive survival horror game, Dead by Daylight Mobile didn’t have to explain any story whatsoever and could have just dumped the players right into matches. But they went the extra mile by having an explanation as to why the countless matches of the game take place. It involves themes of purgatory, alternate dimensions, and time-travel shenanigans to pull it off.\r\nConsole level visuals\r\nOne of the things that struck me about Dead by Daylight Mobile was the excellent console-level graphics. Yes, compared to full-on consoles, the graphics have been slightly toned down, particularly the lighting, but it is still overall impressive for a mobile game. The game has been optimized to be playable on most mobile devices without heavily compromising on the quality of the visuals. The environments and characters are well-detailed, and the animations are fluid and smooth.\r\nSuperb sound design\r\nAnother aspect of the game that I was highly impressed with was the sound design. The audio in the game is excellent, and it adds to the overall atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are realistic, and the background music is eerie and haunting, which helps to create a sense of tension and suspense as you play the game. The audio cues are also well-designed and help players to stay aware of their surroundings, anticipate the killer's movements, and also intensifies the panic experienced by the players when being chased and captured.\r\nIn terms of controls, Dead by Daylight Mobile has done an excellent job of adapting the game to touchscreen devices. The controls are intuitive and easy to use, and they feel responsive and accurate. In my testing, the game has partial support for physical controllers, but only the left stick (movement) worked on my Razer Kishi.\r\nPlaying as a survivor, my experience has been heart-wrenching and I felt like I was a character in a horror movie trying to survive. Playing as a killer is a power fantasy experience that feels empowering while at the same time a challenging task, taking on four player-controlled survivors all at once.\r\nThe customization options and progression system add depth and replay value to the game, and the controls are well-adapted to touchscreen devices. If you're a fan of survival horror games and are looking for a new and exciting multiplayer experience on mobile, Dead by Daylight Mobile is definitely worth checking out.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4873020) Originally posted on TapTap.",

A group of survivors emerges from the wreckage. There is no way to repair the ship, leaving no choice but to salvage it for parts and set up a makeshift base.\r\nDream Land is a casual simulation game currently in the testing phase. It deals with four major gameplay elements. Base building, Resource Farming, Exploration, and Combat. All of these four aspects are all done by your team of survivors who in turn have basic necessities that you need to manage like sleep, food, and hygiene, highly reminiscent of popular games like The Sims and RimWorld.\r\nThe graphics are cartoonish with some non-anime chibi character designs, and the overall aesthetic feels like a 2D high quality indie game with clean detailed visuals and vibrant colors.\r\nDream Land features a base building element that is anchored by the main structure: The Base Management Center, a “Town Hall” of sorts that determines the settlement's base level. Upgrading it will result in more benefits and unlock more construction opportunities for buildings. Players can build walls, doorways, flooring, and many different objects such as workbenches, beds, and other furniture.\r\nThe whole system seems complex, but the hours-long tutorial section integrated in a main quest campaign system takes its time into really teaching the mechanics to the players. It is simple to follow, and overall the Base Building mechanics are very engaging and immersive. There is a high level of personalization and customization when it comes to building where players have complete control over every tile in your territory.\r\nAside from the required resources, buildings and upgrades will have prerequisite building and level requirements that you need to meet first before you can proceed, and it is a well crafted cycle that ensures all buildings are appropriately within a few levels of one another. There is always an attainable upgrade just around the corner, which makes it very enticing for players to keep coming back for more upgrades.\r\nOf course, in order to build structures and upgrade them, players will need resources. This is where the resource gathering comes in. Players can issue commands to the team to take down trees for wood, mine for ores, and pick out fruits and plants. Players are also required to take part in farming or hunting to provide food for the settlement.\r\nFarming, gathering, and even building structures can take time. For example, the crop I use takes 1 hour of real-time to grow, and you cannot skip this or fast forward the time.\r\nExploration in Dream Land comes in two flavors. Exploration around the settlement, where players can hunt, battle marauders, look for resources, and farm, and there is also the “World” exploration that allows players to travel beyond their settlement in an overworld that reminds me of Civilization’s hex tiles, participate in various activities such as enemy raids, looting, and defending important assets in a tower wave defense format.\r\nThe combat, while automated, is nicely presented with potent sound effects and satisfying enemy kills. The combat boils down to the team’s stats, level, and gear, versus the enemies’, plus strategic positioning and tactical placement of units and towers.\r\nExploration is often rewarded with various resources, items, and upgrades, providing players with a sense of accomplishment and progress. Players may also encounter challenging raids and defense missions that require both good gear and strategy to overcome.\r\nDespite the casual look, the whole game is fully simulated, with each of the player’s commands requiring a survivor to physically execute, running around the settlement every so often. Crafting using the workbench, gathering wood, or building structures will occupy a survivor’s time.\r\nEven as simple as moving furniture is done by the survivor. The queuing system works really well and players won’t have to worry about any pathing or queueing issues that may arise from constantly issuing back and forth random commands for the survivors to do.\r\nSince Dream Land is free to play, there is a main currency called gold that you can use to speed things up, unlock more slots in crafting, or to add more moves to the World exploration. However, in-app purchases aren’t implemented yet in my knowledge, so the game is 100% free to play as of the moment.\r\nAs far as the technical experience goes, I found Dream Land not very well optimized for in general, considering it has 2D indie graphics, the performance felt sluggish overall. In addition, I get disconnected too easily when moving in and out of the app while playing. For a mostly single player experience, it is heavily reliant on online connectivity. The hard to use camera panning controls could use a bit of refining too, as well as minor gripes with how the build menu doesn’t have names of the structures unless you hold select them.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4873107) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "This is what happens when even a one-handed game like Vampire Survivors is still too much work. We now enter the realm of Idle and AFK games where you don’t even have to do anything to play and progress. Alice, Final Weapon : Idle RPG is another entry in this popular mobile genre.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Satisfying automated monster killing action\r\n- Engaging progression system\r\n- Bonus things to do like quests and missions\r\n- Low power mode for optimal idle gameplay## Cons\r\n- Can get grindy a few hours in\r\nAlice, Final Weapon : Idle RPG is an idle top-down monster shooter RPG game with typical anime-style visuals and cel-shaded graphics, where players infinitely kill monsters in a never-ending cycle. There is no story, and the whole focus is the non-stop gameplay.\r\nPlay infinitely\r\nThe gameplay loop consists of the player character clearing increasingly difficult stages, gathering enough currency and materials to upgrade their character and acquire more powerful weapons, to be able to clear higher stages. Kill monsters, get upgrades, experiment with builds, kill bigger monsters, rinse and repeat.\r\nWhen I say “clearing”, players don’t literally clear the stages of monsters. In fact, all stages run infinitely, with an infinite barrage of monsters. Instead, a certain bar gets filled that gives players the option to challenge the boss of that stage and when killed, advances you to the next stage. This way, players can either stay in this stage to comfortably farm or advance to the next stage at their own volition. Dying doesn’t mean anything, no resets, and no progress is lost.\r\nConstant incremental upgrades\r\nThere are many underlying mechanics in ALICE, from the itemization, level progression, boss fights, to the side missions that result in a game that constantly engages the player and keeps him tinkering with the character despite the passive idle nature. There is no active combat gameplay aside from the optional movement and dash option, but it still involves a lot of character building and tinkering. Nevertheless, while ALICE is an AFK game in its core, but there is still an option to partly manually control the character’s movements\r\nThere are two main currencies in the game. Gold and Diamond. Gold is usually the “free” currency while Diamond is the premium one. Aside from XP, Gold is also used to improve the character’s different attributes like attack, vitality, or critical hit damage. These two currencies anchor the whole progression system of the game: used in upgrades, loot drops, and leveling up. The progression system overall is very engaging, giving players a plethora of frequent upgrade options and paths all throughout due to its highly incremental system.\r\nThe weapons, skills, and armors are letter tiered and are usually acquired by a “loot summoning” technique which requires diamonds. Players can either keep playing the game and do quests and missions; or watch ads and spend some cash to accumulate diamonds to have more chances at loot drops. Fair play for the developers for not locking Diamonds behind a paywall, but it is still hard to acquire once the initial tutorial quest ends and you reach the higher levels. All duplicates can be upgraded into higher tiers, which basically makes even the low-quality drops useful with quantity.\r\nLoot is randomized, but the chances of getting better loot increases with every loot summon, providing assurance that players will eventually get top tier loot regardless of their luck, instead of purely relying on unforgiving RNG drop rates.\r\nAside from leveling up the character and upgrading the gear. The character can also increase “challenge” its rank by trying out a 1v1 boss fight. Increasing a rank will give off massive bonuses such as an increased skill or passive slot.

    "body": "Mighty DOOM is a top down single handed rogue-lite shooter set in the DOOM universe. It is available for Android and iOS as a free-to-play title with in-app purchases.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Engaging rogue-lite mechanics\r\n- Fun and satisfying combat\r\n- Awesome takedown animations\r\n- Adorable graphics but still gruesome## Cons\r\n-Artificial difficulty spike to encourage spending money\r\n-Playtime is heavily limited by the energy system\r\nOne-handed play\r\nIt looks like DOOM is joining the single touch craze these days by releasing their newest title for the mobile platform — Mighty DOOM. A top down action shooter where players control the mini Slayer, battling mini Demons in an arcade style combat with rogue-lite progression and mission structure.\r\nMini Doom, Mini Everything\r\nEverything in this game is “mini” and adorable, because it is set in the “animated DOOM universe”, an alternate reality featuring DOOM’s collectible toys. Make no mistake, the visuals are adorable and cute, but it is still gruesome and as gory as the mainline games, with blood splatters and dismemberments being a regular sight for players. It’s still not for kids.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay is simple: using just one hand, control the mini Slayer to avoid enemy attacks and position shots. His regular shots automatically fire, while the secondary weapons and abilities are manually activated.\r\nThere are various weapons and gears that players can acquire in Mighty DOOM, such as regular rifles, laser guns, or swords and chainsaws. Players can incrementally upgrade them as well by using materials and currency earned from runs. There are also other playable characters and cosmetics, but most of them are locked in a paywall or hard to get in-game currency.\r\nIn a rogue-lite fashion, players start off with a basic weapon behavior, and proceed to get 3 random choices for upgrades every once and a while once the ability meter fills up. This choice ranges from a simple stat boost such as an increased health or damage; to a more substantial way that changes how the weapons operate, such as adding another projectile, or making bullets bounce out to other enemies. This makes the gameplay a lot more emergent, and can leave the player excited to wait for and choose the next upgrade.\r\nOnce players are a couple of stages in and their weapons are abundantly upgraded, the game is at its best — bullets, missiles and lasers are flying, ricocheting between or piercing through enemies, players are gloriously mowing down groups of mini demons with ease in what seems like a pretty artistic display of fireworks. In Mighty DOOM, beauty is mayhem.\r\nAside from the three choices, there are other opportunities to gain in-run upgrades as well, such as a mod-bot spin roulette that appears after every boss fight, and a boon+curse offer that you can either accept or reject, depending if the pros outweighs the cons.\r\nWhen you die, there is a one-time option of continuing the game via an Ad or an in-game currency, after that, players have to reset the whole chapter from start. Not all progression is lost however, as you can upgrade your character, weapons, and gear to get a better chance on the next try. Every run consumes energy, which is the time-currency of Mighty DOOM, meaning players won't be able to delightfully play as often as they like.\r\nInstead, there are also a lot of incentives for players to keep playing it in a daily manner, providing events, daily missions, and login bonuses giving off additional rewards to help in the progression.\r\nGlory Kills are here\r\nIt would not be the modern DOOM that we know and love, if there weren't brutal melee takedowns and challenging boss fights present. And the Mighty DOOM does indeed feature both. Every chapter contains a total of 40 stages, and every 10 stages will feature a boss fight, which is taken from regular mobs but bigger and badder (still a mini though), each with their own style of attacks that players have to master.\r\nIn addition to the regular top-down shooter combat, there are also awesome stylish takedowns for regular mobs and bosses alike. Once defeated, regular mobs have a chance to be “staggered” that when approached, instantly triggers a takedown that, like the main games, heals the player.\r\nThere are a total of nine chapters that get progressively harder to complete, and while it is only nine chapters, the game will still take a considerable amount of time to complete even if there are unlimited energies, due to the difficulty spikes per chapter. The resulting game is a challenging one, with the biggest factor being the ability of players to avoid and withstand enemy projectiles and attacks, which in turn is partly augmented by their level and gear.\r\nThe difficulty spikes felt artificially made, with exponentially harder chapters and scarce loot drops, probably to encourage the players to spend some cash. If you are hardcore enough, you can still opt to keep playing without ever spending a dime since the game is fun enough to cater some grinding to the player, and the traditional energy system will limit your playtime per day anyway preventing burnouts.\r\nAfter experiencing Mighty DOOM even for a short while, I feel that this game should have been a premium game instead, offering a steady flow of progression to the player, with more fun and less grind and money spent.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4881081) Originally posted on TapTap.",

You are given multiple empty panels for a given scenario, plus a multitude of settings and characters to place per scenario. It’s up to you to arrange them in a way that will fit the scenario’s objectives. Be it somebody dying, living happily ever after, or getting revenge; you need to satisfy the objective in order to solve the puzzle.\r\nThe panels affect each other chronologically, a character dying early in the story will become a ghost if placed later on. Making two characters fall in love with each other will induce heartbreaks for any additional lover you might want to add… unless the setting specifically calls for an affair. This mechanic is just cleverly made, intricately designed, and it has led me to trying out many different combinations of characters and settings just to see what would happen in the other panels.\r\nThese characters have their own personalities built that players should take into account for the story. For example, Isabela is a woman with strong convictions, and perhaps has evil tendencies. While Lenora is easy to get depressed and prone to being sad. Some characters have a tendency to do good or bad actions; and get happy or sad. Other characters will have a starting disposition to one of the other characters, such as the Knight being loyal to his Queen, or a King being in love with his maid, adding a dynamic to the storytelling aspect.\r\nProper motivation is needed for characters to perform desired actions, you cannot just place a character together with a poison and expect him to drink it. He must need proper motivation — a broken heart or an unsuspecting soul ought to do it.\r\nAs captivating the gameplay is, Storyteller doesn’t overstay its welcome having only around 13 chapters with 4 scenarios each. Some puzzles are straightforward, some will require a bit of brain finesse to solve. For the price it asks, which is $15 by the way, it's a tall order.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4883548) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Alice, Final Weapon : Idle RPG , or ALICE is an idle monster killing RPG game with typical anime-style visuals and cel-shaded graphics, where players infinitely kill monsters in a never-ending cycle. There is no in-game story, and the whole focus is the non-stop gameplay.\r\nThe gameplay loop consists of the player character clearing increasingly difficult stages, gathering enough currency and materials to upgrade their character and acquire more powerful weapons, to be able to clear higher stages. Kill monsters, get upgrades, experiment with builds, kill bigger monsters, rinse and repeat.\r\nThere are many underlying mechanics in ALICE, from the itemization, level progression, boss fights, to the side missions that result in a game that constantly engages the player and keeps him tinkering with the character despite the passive idle nature. There is no active combat gameplay, but it still involves a lot of character building and tinkering. Nevertheless, while ALICE is an AFK game in its core, but there is still an option to partly manually control the character’s movements\r\nThe weapons, skills, and armors are letter tiered and are usually acquired by a “loot summoning” technique which requires diamonds. Players can either keep playing the game and do quests and missions; or watch ads and spend some cash to accumulate diamonds to have more chances at loot drops. Fair play for the developers for not locking Diamonds behind a paywall, but it is still hard to acquire once the initial tutorial quest ends and you reach the higher levels.\r\nLoot is randomized, but the chances of getting better loot increases with every loot summon, providing assurance that players will eventually get top tier loot regardless of their luck, instead of purely relying on unforgiving RNG drop rates.\r\nThe AFK/Idling aspect is well implemented, even offering a low power mode where the screen turns off but the game still runs in the background. It does require periodic online connectivity to work, however.\r\nPlaying Alice, Final Weapon : Idle RPG, I was immediately engaged by its progression system and the fun climb upward through the monster filled stages. However, I easily reached its soft paywall and any substantial progression got slower and slower from then on. Thankfully, the game is not as tainted as other free-to-play games and the in-app purchases are only encouraged at worst, and optional at best, not forced down your throat.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Slenderman RE: Light Edition is an adventure horror mobile game based on the Slender Man supernatural character. It is played in first person view and plays like an adventure game where you are to interact with the environment in order to progress.\r\n## Pros\r\n- scary atmosphere## Cons\r\n-non-existent story\r\n-rudimentary map and game design\r\n-terrible controls\r\n-the camera while moving is disorienting\r\nThe premise is that our main character, the Dave Grohl-looking dude named Edward, is sort of a ghost-hunter. He stumbles upon an abandoned building in the woods and comes across a supernatural experience. With his trusty flashlight, he has to find a way out.\r\nThat’s the basic gist of the story, if there was even any. There is no voice acting, no comprehensible cinematics, nor any explanation provided to the player. In fact, I learned more about the story in the game’s store description than the actual game itself.\r\nThere is a totally separate version called Slenderman RE that plays and looks nothing like this game. It was also made by a different developer. At face value, Slenderman RE: Light Edition looks like a “toned down” port of the original Slenderman RE, but with seemingly the same premise and story.\r\nLooks great, but looks bad at the same time\r\nDespite being apparently toned down, the graphics still look impressive for a mobile game. Still, it does come with some glaring flaws, as the game doesn’t look very polished, some objects like trees and houses are even floating in the air.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay of Slenderman RE: Light Edition is about on par with the story. It’s very elementary and it’s almost like some young aspiring developer made it as a school demo or project. Players just move and look around in first person view and interact with objects by looking at them and touching the interact button. There is another button to toggle the flashlight, and that’s just it. No sprinting and stamina mechanics, battery, nor hard time limit like the original game from more than 10 years ago.\r\nThe camera shakes too much\r\nThe controls and the camera totally sucks to the point that it’s unplayable. The camera bobs around too much while moving that it's disorienting, the camera tries too much to be realistic but in fact it is the exact opposite. The movement controls on the other hand are too unreliable and the camera is too sensitive even at the lowest settings.\r\nA classic Slender experience via the minigames\r\nSlenderman RE: Light Edition features two game modes, the story, and the mini-games. The story follows Edward in his experience in that abandoned building, while the mini-games follow a classic Slender Man experience, where players are placed in a map of your choice (out of four) and they’d have to collect all the objects in order to win.\r\nBrowsing at the options, the game seemed like it supports controllers, however when I’ve tried it with a Razer Kishi controller, the right stick is inverted vertically with no way of changing it, rendering the controller support semi-unplayable.\r\nThe story is a mediocre experience with almost non-existent adventure game mechanics aside from basically moving around. The interactables like doors, pages, radios, etc are just there to exist and don't provide any valuable gameplay element to the system. The experience feels like a cheap haunted amusement ride where the sensation of being startled and scared is what matters the most over freedom and substance.\r\nAnd it does scare the player, with its creepy surroundings and incessant abuse of screechy and chilling sound effects. However, there is no real danger to the player from a gameplay perspective. Most of the game is just walking around the environment trying to progress.\r\nThe mini-games are in the same boat as well, and the elementary game design is even more evident with its copy pasted and monotonous map design, uninspired placement of buildings and trees, and the game is just too easy to win, you can’t literally lose to Slender Man, I tried running towards him and he just disappears. Not to mention he constantly unceremoniously appears right in your view, in broad daylight. The only real difficulty is finding some of the last pages in the big maps. Ironically, this is more fun than the actual story mode, because at least it somewhat resembles the original Slender experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4880978) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The Demo is monikered “Chapter 0” and is meant to introduce us to the Voice of Cards trilogy which started in 2021 and ended in 2022, now recently released for the Mobile platform. More specifically, Chapter 0 serves as a prelude to the first game in the series. It is only a short demo and I was pretty done after an hour or so.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Table-top RPG based aesthetic and gameplay\r\n- Engaging turn-based combat system\r\n- Free to try## Cons\r\n-non-table-top RPG players might find the game slow\r\nChapter 0 starts with a very welcoming tone coming from the narrator, or the “gamemaster” in table-top terms, introducing us to the world and its mechanics. Immediately, fans of the table-top RPG will appreciate its card-based aesthetic and similarities to the table-top setup.\r\nBasically everything in this game is represented by cards. The characters, settings, and the world. The story opens with a group of white-robed trio of adventurers being given an important quest by the Queen’s in exchange for rewards. The queen gives us valuable information to jumpstart our search and sends us out to the world.\r\nSoon after, I was battling monsters in the wilderness in a traditional card game turn-based format, animated to show a bit of eye candy; stumbled upon a town, talked to villagers, and investigated what the Queen wanted and where.\r\nThe combat is engaging enough, it mostly resembles a turn-based combat system, but every combatant is a card. Every character has their own deck of cards which are their available moves and skills. Typically, players select one move such as an attack or a powerful spell, which may or may not need gems to activate (don’t worry this is not a premium currency). There are six different elements that counteract each other to add even more depth.\r\nThe playthrough has been very immersive as a Table-top RPG experience albeit it can be a slow paced ordeal especially for non-table-top RPG players. I moved around a game piece to maneuver my party around a table-top collection of face-down cards representing the game world, and every movement I make reveals the faces of surrounding cards in a fog-of-war fashion. Putting the game piece or characters, item chests, or establishments will initiate an interaction such as talking, looting, or shopping.\r\nVoice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars Chapter 0 is a really immersive experience, and I’m positive many Table-top RPG fans will love it. I’m looking forward to playing the full game and the succeeding games in the trilogy. It’s free to try, so if you’re a sucker for Table-top RPG games, I highly recommend it.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4891307) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It features two star-crossed lives turned lovers living seemingly normal lives in somewhat unique circumstances; the man, Reymond, seems to be a smart astrophysicist locked in prison, and the woman, Emily, a university student studying astronomy, is accompanied by her blue bird that she can communicate with.\r\nThe gameplay I encountered is composed of point-and-click mechanics and puzzle elements that most of the time, incorporates themes of astrophysics; from the matching star constellations and mapping out planetary orbits, to the rhythm game element with a starry night backdrop.\r\nIt also features more mundane tasks like turning off alarm clocks or opening a letter to emphasize the slice of life storytelling format. And it works, accompanied by a moving melodramatic soundtrack, the narrative is relatable, immersive, and captivating.\r\nLucid Lenses’ plot is simple yet imaginative and unfolds beautifully throughout the five chapters. The alternating scenarios for the two characters and the narrative format is just amazingly delivered. It is very short, but very exciting because of the unpredictability of the story with regards to its chronological order and narrative turns.\r\nThe interactable gameplay and storytelling elements go well together and are nicely balanced, and it never really felt like a chore to play through. The puzzles are mildly challenging and the narrative is told in small chunks at a time.\r\nAt the outset, Lucid Lenses is a short but beautiful experience for a very affordable price. If you like astronomy, romance, or classic adventure games, I highly recommend trying it out.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

You are given multiple empty panels for a given scenario, plus a multitude of settings and characters to place per scenario. It’s up to you to arrange them in a way that will fit the scenario’s objectives. Be it somebody dying, living happily ever after, or getting revenge; you need to satisfy the objective in order to solve the puzzle.\r\nSometimes, there are bonus objectives that might require a very specific event to happen. Such as instead of just killing a character, a certain character needs to perform the task. Sometimes, the objective is riddle-like, not clear and specific, further adding to the puzzle solving aspect.\r\nThe panels affect each other chronologically, a character dying early in the story will become a ghost if placed later on. Making two characters fall in love with each other will induce heartbreaks for any additional lover you might want to add… unless the setting specifically calls for an affair. This mechanic is just cleverly made, intricately designed, and it has led me to trying out many different combinations of characters and settings just to see what would happen in the other panels.\r\nThe different settings on the other hand sets the situation and tone for the characters, they can either fall in love, hate one another, fight, or kill each other depending on the setting. Marriages, kidnappings, poisonings, forests, ballrooms, and throne rooms are all part of the possible options.\r\nThe game comprises 12 short standalone chapters, with 4 unrelated scenarios each chapter, bearing the same narrative themes. Many of the characters are recurring, appearing in multiple scenarios and chapters that help players to easily identify and familiarize themselves with their personalities. Despite that, I still got confused for at least this one group of characters, with their bearded looks and identical hair colors.\r\nThese characters have their own personalities built that players should take into account for the story. For example, Isobel is a woman with strong convictions, and perhaps has evil tendencies. While Lenora is easy to get depressed and prone to being sad. Some characters have a tendency to do good or bad actions; and get happy or sad.

You can either set up the detective as a witness, or have a witness tell him the crime, both paths will meet the objectives.\r\nAs captivating the gameplay is, it doesn’t overstay its welcome being only around 2 hours long, provided that you can solve the puzzles in a modest amount of time. Some puzzles are straightforward, some will require a bit of brain finesse to solve.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4901858) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is a table-top RPG game in video game format. It has recently been ported to the Android and iOS Mobile platforms, after first releasing back in 2022 for Playstation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Open exploration and an adventurous tone\r\n- Table-top RPG based aesthetic and gameplay\r\n- Engaging turn-based combat system\r\n- premium game with no ads, or pay-to-win mechanics, but there are purchasable cosmetics## Cons\r\n-non-table-top RPG players might find the game slow\r\n-feels like the same game mechanically, with no improvements, for those who played the previous game\r\nVoice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is the second released game in the Voice of Cards trilogy, While still set in the same world as the other games, it features an all new standalone story that makes it completely playable without needing to have played any of the other games in the trilogy.\r\nIt follows the Voice of Cards gameplay and storytelling format, which is basically aiming for a table-top RPG card game aesthetic with anime-inspired characters and features a fully voiced narrator that serves as the game master of the game. Comparing this game to the first, the narrator has been much improved with a more lively voice, matching the more lighthearted but still melancholic tone of this game.\r\nThe story follows our player named character and his main companion — the frustrated “Forsaken” Maiden named Laty. The main premise is that each of these islands have a designated Maiden to keep their islands safe via ritual, but for some reason, Laty, the maiden for our hometown of Omega Island, cannot perform said ritual. This sets the characterts to embark on a journey across various islands and towns in order to save Omega Island.\r\nThe overall feel of the game feels very adventurous, and the world is more of an open world and focuses more on exploration — which will make players feel like they’re in some kind of odyssey or a grand epic adventure. This is different to the first game which was very linear in nature. The presentation felt immersive and the descriptive language of the storytelling and the narrator’s rendition of it was really captivating.\r\nAs for the gameplay, it mainly revolves around traveling to different destinations, completing quests for NPCs, and battling monsters in a turn-based card game. Players are given a single game piece, and move it around the world represented by cards for each plot of area, and place it on specific plots to interact with them, such as entering towns, speaking to NPCs, or opening chests for loot. The overall pacing is a bit slow, with various card animation and drawn-out narrated descriptions and dialogues, but there is a high speed option to slightly speed the gameplay up.\r\nIn the battles, each participant takes turns in performing moves taken from their available deck of cards, such as various elemental attacks, heals, and special abilities. Some abilities may need a consumable called gem to use, and some will require dice rolls in order to determine its effectivity. For the whole RPG experience, including the progressions, character gears, nothing really is groundbreaking here, just being a passable engaging experience overall, to complement the storytelling.\r\nNote that while Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is a sequel to Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars, they are almost the same game mechanically, and offer little to no improvement gameplay wise. Even some of the character artwork and monsters, are directly copy-pasted from the first game. It would be more appropriate to think of this as an expansion or a new story content, rather than a full-pledged successor. Especially that it came out just mere months after the first game.\r\nUltimately, the main focus of Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is the narrative and the presentation, and it certainly delivers, with a likable cast of characters, a buoyant adventurous tone that players can immerse themselves into, the game just connects with you on a personal level. For $12, a game with no ads or pay-to-win mechanics and are just straight up story-driven from start to end, is a game that I would highly recommend, especially, for those already fascinated by table-top games.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4903147) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Lucid Lenses is a narratively-driven romantic adventure game featuring mesmerizing puzzles and clever interactions, bolstered by a nice soft vibrant painting-like artwork.\r\n## Pros\r\n- fun puzzling mechanics\r\n- plot is simple yet imaginative\r\n- beautiful artwork and soundtrack## Cons\r\n-Out of place mini-games from other genres\r\nLucid Lenses’ story is deep rooted in astronomy and the study of the cosmos. It features two star-crossed lives turned lovers living seemingly normal lives in somewhat unique circumstances; the man, Reymond, seems to be a smart astrophysicist locked in prison, and the woman, Emily, a university student studying astronomy, is accompanied by her blue bird that she can communicate with.\r\nAt first, aside from their shared interest in the stars, their lives couldn’t be more opposite. One is a prisoner, and one is an aspiring astronomer still studying. However, this contrast is the intrigue of the story which I won’t spoil any further\r\nThe gameplay I encountered is composed of point-and-click mechanics and puzzle elements that most of the time, incorporates themes of astrophysics; from the matching star constellations and mapping out planetary orbits, to the rhythm game element with a starry night backdrop.\r\nIt also features more mundane tasks like turning off alarm clocks or opening a letter to emphasize the slice of life storytelling format. And it works, accompanied by a moving melodramatic soundtrack, the narrative is relatable, immersive, and captivating.\r\nAs an astrophysics enthusiast myself, I appreciated how they integrated the concept into the gameplay, especially in how the planetary orbits are plotted and the matching simple puzzle implementation, they really turned something as complex as orbital mechanics into something artistic and simple.\r\nIt also features other familiar mini-games throughout the entire experience; flappy bird (yes), stacking, whack-a-moles, rhythm games, and dress-ups. It’s a very interactive story, but how it randomly mashes up elements from other games, it kind of feels out of place sometimes, and not everyone is going to welcome it.\r\nLucid Lenses’ plot is simple yet imaginative and unfolds beautifully throughout the five chapters. The alternating scenarios for the two characters and the narrative format is just amazingly delivered. It is very short, but very exciting because of the unpredictability of the story with regards to its chronological order and narrative turns.\r\nThe interactable gameplay and storytelling elements go well together and are nicely balanced, and it never really felt like a chore to play through. The puzzles are mildly challenging and the narrative is told in small chunks at a time.\r\nAt the outset, Lucid Lenses is a short but beautiful experience for a very affordable price. If you like astronomy, romance, or classic adventure games, I highly recommend trying it out.\r\nWhile it is tagged as an early access release, the game is still fully playable from start to finish and it could not see any glaring issues with it as far as game-breaking bugs go. It could have been longer, as I just finished it in one sitting, but I can’t really ask much for how cheap it is.\r\nLucid Lenses is a very short but very meaningful game that is sure to captivate players with its beautiful narrative and presentation. For just $4, you think of it as buying access to a great interactive short story. If you like astronomy, romance, and classic adventure games, then this game is an even better buy.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4901865) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Released in 2021 for the Playstation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC, it has now been recently ported for Android and iOS mobile platforms.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Table-top RPG based aesthetic and gameplay\r\n- Engaging turn-based combat system\r\n- premium game with no ads, or pay-to-win mechanics, but there are purchasable cosmetics## Cons\r\n-non-table-top RPG players might find the game slow paced\r\nEver wanted to play a table-top RPG game, with all its aesthetic, charms, and allure? But want to do it at the comfort of your mobile phone? Complete with its own narrative, gamemaster, and setting packaged in an accessible video game form? Well you’re in luck with Voice of Cards.\r\nVoice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is the first in a trilogy of Table-top RPG games developed by Square Enix titled Voice of Cards, from the acclaimed writer of the NieR and Drakengard series, which is known for his intricate and amazing worldbuilding and stories. A lot of aspects in this game speaks high production, from the voice acting to the storytelling. The game is fully narrated (with subtitles) by that serves as the game master of this alluring RPG card game.\r\nThe world is represented by cards, in fact everything is represented by cards; the characters, items, monsters, and the levels. Even when traversing the land and visiting towns, you are roaming around in a bundle of cards forming a tile-based representation of that area. You control your game piece and place it to whatever card/tile you want to interact with, be it the card of the town armorer, shop, or normal townspeople that you may need to interact with to progress the story.\r\nThe story picks off right at the middle of Chapter 0 (as told in the playable prelude Demo), a royal treasure wanted by the Queen has been retrieved by a trio of white-robed adventurers called the Ivory Order, and they are about to hunt a recently awakened Dragon next. Then, the game segues into the introduction of the player named main character and his animal companion Mar, both no-name adventurers who are also trying to hunt the aforementioned Dragon as well.\r\nFor the majority of the game, it mostly consists of either exploration, talking to NPCs, or combat. This is all done in card and table-top manner. Exploring the outside worlds will lead you into random combat encounters, and these happen in a turn-based card game instance. The combat is fairly challenging, with each character having their own deck of skills and abilities to choose from, complete with dice rolls and an elemental counter system. There are six different elemental attributes that form a six-way rock-paper-scissors weakness system.\r\nThe overall progression system felt adequate enough to support the narrative-first nature of the game. Not much revolutionary mechanics here and there, but ultimately it is fun enough to level up characters, unlock abilities, and acquire new gear to better trump enemies.\r\nThe game tries its best to be as immersive as a table-top RPG as possible, including taking its sweet time with its presentation and storytelling. Patience is key here, as many of the UI elements and animations are slower than the we are used to, and most of the game's narrative are via narration and dialogue, in which the slower pace can be a determining factor for more action-oriented audiences. There is in fact a high speed option in the settings, but overall, the game might still feel slow.\r\nOverall, the game is amazing as a Table-top RPG experience packed in a video game format. The mobile nature is just perfect for bringing in with you a whole singleplayer table-top experience wherever you go. For the content it brings and for being a premium game with no pay-to-win mechanics, the $12 asking price is rightfully justified.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4902221) Originally posted on TapTap.",

But if you’re coming into this review without having played the first two games, don’t leave just yet, as Voice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden is another standalone title that you can start the trilogy with, just all set in the same world. They all came out at the same time for both iOS and Android which might make it confusing for newcomers, but you can play them in any specific order.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Table-top RPG based aesthetic and gameplay\r\n- JRPG style combat with monster capturing mechanic\r\n- premium game with no ads, or pay-to-win mechanics, but there are in-app purchasable cosmetics## Cons\r\n-non-table-top RPG players might find the game slow paced\r\nVoice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden features a nice persona change from its other two predecessors, by featuring a female protagonist with a story narrated by a female game master, in what seems like the best performance out of all the narrators so far.\r\nThe setting of the game takes us into the player named character’s underground home village, constantly besieged by monsters coming from above. The character is a young but fierce warrior, who alongside other abled villagers, regularly defends their village from monsters.\r\nAs with the title, the game features a sinister tone, and one that has the most darkest premise  out of all the games, and players will soon find that out very early in the story. Tragedy will soon befell on the character and it sets her on a path of revenge and self-discovery.\r\nVoice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden adapts basically the same gameplay format from the Voice of Cards series, where the whole setup is a typical JRPG, but instead of the world rendered as 3d models or 2d sprites, every element is represented by cards. For example, the world is just a grid-like arrangement of cards with each card depicting the terrain; like a grassland, a town pavement, or a mountain range. Each character, shop, door, or chest are instead cards that the player interacts with a game piece. As inherent with the series, the game is slower paced than most games, but there is a high speed option in the settings to help alleviate some concerns.\r\nWhen you’re exploring dungeons, combat encounters will randomly appear and take you into a traditional JRPG turn-based battle format albeit with a card game makeover. Each of those characters — which are cards themselves — have different card abilities that they can use, and all the combatants take turns attacking each other.  While the combat is basic, they try their best to make it as lively as possible; when performing actions such as attacking or activating abilities, the cards are animated complete with matching visual effects.\r\nIn the early parts of the game, the main character will also discover her special ability to capture and control monsters using monsters cards (yes, the main character is using cards in a game already made with cards) in a Pokemon like fashion that adds a much needed layer and freshens the gameplay a little bit for those who have already played the first two games.\r\nIn Voice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden, the narrative takes precedence while the somewhat still engaging but simple gameplay takes a backseat. The story is heavy and depressing. It is much more personal and the main motivations are coming from the main character, instead of the companions.\r\nDespite being the third game, it still felt like an expansion or a bonus story, featuring the same underlying core mechanics (and some assets) that are copy and pasted throughout the series.\r\nWrapping it up, Voice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden is a decent expansion to the amazing table-top RPG game series Voice of Cards. It adds further refinements to the game mechanics, especially with its unique monster capturing element. Generally, it still feels more of the same, and it’s not a full-pledged sequel one might expect. But as a game at face value, especially with its darker and more heavy narrative theme, it stands well on its own and it’s a worthy play at $12 especially for those already on the fence.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4903817) Originally posted on TapTap.",

I was one of the naysayers back then saying that Resident Evil 4, with its still decent 3D graphics, doesn’t need a remake yet. Boy I was wrong. This first impression is all about me eating my words and playing myself, because let me tell you, Resident Evil 4 Remake (or just Resident Evil 4) is a beautiful reimagining of the 2005 masterpiece.\r\nImmediately I was presented with the story introduction which expanded upon the original game further, with more details and scenes added to it, and more flashbacks to Resident Evil 2’s own remake that also featured Leon S. Kennedy as a then rookie cop. The exposition scenes and the initial prologue chapter are longer than I remember. It looks like the canon being used coming into this game is from the remake of the second game.\r\nThe graphics fidelity is just about on par with the Resident Evil 2 remake, if not better. Comparing it to the original classic, the jump in visual quality is leaps and bounds better. As a modern game on its own, the graphics are highly realistic; the dark medieval-looking setting, life-like lighting and stunning environments it has going on really sets the tone for the rest of the game.\r\nResident Evil 4 plays like a typical third person shooter, except for the fact that the movement and shooting has actual weight to it. You really feel Leon’s every movement in every step, dodge, and kick he makes. This feel is consistent throughout all the other gameplay elements; The impact of the kicks are so satisfying, the ammo isn’t as plentiful as military shooters, and headshots here aren’t a guaranteed instant kill but merely a stun for you to satisfying kick enemies to the face makes Resident Evil 4 an effectively terrifying game despite being half-part action game.\r\nAs Leon S. Kennedy investigates the missing daughter, he encounters this creepy cult-like settlement in the middle of the woods with even creepier inhabitants. As opposed to the more open area nature of Resident Evil 2, the design is now shifted into chapter-based linear adventure, in which the players progress through by defeating occasional hordes of enemies and solving challenging puzzles to unlock passageways and move on to the next part. Every once in a while, there will be a boss fight each with their unique mechanics that play out.\r\nThere are many quality of life improvements in Resident Evil 4 compared to the original 2005 game and even the recent Resident Evil 2 remake. Since Leon is now a trained agent, he can now engage in devastating melee combat unlike when he was a rookie cop who just knew how to use knives. He can also now counter and parry enemy attacks and easily turn the tide if enemies manage to close the gap.  There is also an added stealth kill to further give players options as to how to approach new areas. You may want to thin out their numbers before engaging, or perhaps you just want to conserve ammo. This makes the combat more fluid than ever, and gives players more freedom than in any of the recent Resident Evil titles.\r\nHowever, this buff to the main character also comes with caveats, especially with some buffs to enemies; now with more unpredictable animations that will make aiming – especially to the head — very challenging, they can lay down bear traps in the middle of a confrontation, caughting players off guard, as well adding a durability option to Leon’s knife – repairable by the merchant -– that will encourage you to conserve it use as much as possible.\r\nThey really nailed the atmosphere of this game, and the survivor horror feel they went back into is retained without ever so slightly going towards the action gameplay it already left years ago. The hallways and interiors are way darker and scarier than ever, the environments are more gritty and dirtier than I remember, and the violence is made more gruesome with more detailed blood and guts put into it. Even If I have played the original before and beat it multiple times, this still feels like a fresh experience that I’m now compelled to play from start to end.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4915323) Originally posted on TapTap.",

I was one of the naysayers back then saying that Resident Evil 4, with its still decent 3D graphics, doesn’t need a remake yet. Boy I was wrong, as the Resident Evil 4 Remake (or just Resident Evil 4) is a beautiful reimagining of the 2005 masterpiece.\r\nWell balanced survival horror and action elements\r\nI also thought that by giving it the Resident Evil 2 treatment which focused on a terrifying horror aesthetic, that the action-packed shooter aspect of the original Resident Evil 4 would be effectively negated — with less enemies and less action. It seemed that I was wrong again, as the new remake has functionally balanced both aspects, providing a terrifying experience on top of providing action-packed shooter gameplay to the game.\r\nRemake canon slowly taking over\r\nAt the start of the game, I was presented with the story introduction which expanded upon the original game further, with more details and scenes added to it, and much needed flashbacks from Resident Evil 2’s own remake. The exposition scenes and the initial prologue chapter are longer than I remember. It looks like the canon being used coming into this game is from the remake of the second game.\r\nEveryone is now more grounded\r\nThis time around, the story embraces a more serious and realistic tone, gone are the cheesy one-liners and cocky Leon from the original game. And Leon overall has slightly less plot armor shown when it comes to the sequences and events. He is more vulnerable here and it results in a highly suspenseful storytelling experience for the players.\r\nAll of the characters from the original have returned, and most of their personalities are more or less consistent with the previous version, but I can’t help but notice some of their charm is gone or toned down for realism purposes. For example, Leon is not as quippy anymore and Luis is slightly less funnier now. However, Ashley is more independent here and doesn't require as much babysitting as the original game.\r\nStunning graphics\r\nThe graphics fidelity is just about on par with the Resident Evil 2 remake, if not better. Comparing it to the original classic, the jump in visual quality is leaps and bounds better. As a modern game on its own, the graphics are highly realistic; the dark medieval-looking setting, life-like lighting and stunning environments it has going on really sets the tone for the rest of the game.\r\nThe level of detail in the characters are stunning, from their well crafted animations that blend well with each other depending on the situation, to the characters’ realistic hair effects that look more fabulous than reality.\r\nGameplay Analysis:\r\nResident Evil 4 plays like a typical third person shooter, except for the fact that the movement and shooting has actual weight to it. You really feel Leon’s every movement in every step, dodge, and kick he makes.\r\nThis feel is consistent throughout all the other gameplay elements; The impact of the kicks are so satisfying, the ammo isn’t as plentiful as military shooters, and headshots here aren’t a guaranteed instant kill but merely a stun for you to satisfyingly kick enemies to the face. All of these elements makes Resident Evil 4 an effectively terrifying game despite being a half-part action game.\r\nAs Leon S. Kennedy investigates the missing daughter, he encounters this creepy cult-like settlement in the middle of the woods with even creepier inhabitants and creatures. As opposed to the more open area nature of Resident Evil 2, the design is now shifted into chapter-based linear adventure, in which the players progress through by defeating occasional hordes of enemies and solving fairly challenging puzzles to unlock passageways and move on to the next part. It sometimes require backtracking to previously visited locations, but with some minor twists and changes to spice the gameplay up.\r\nEvery once in a while, there will be a boss fight each with their unique mechanics that play out. While the whole map is interconnected and it still looks like an open world from the surface, how you progress through them is mostly linear.\r\nAlong the way, Leon will meet other friendly characters, including a mysterious ever present Merchant that can provide him weapons, supplies, and upgrades to help fight the cult. Players can find currency and items scattered throughout the maps, drops from enemies or breakables, to be able to trade with the Merchant's supplies.\r\nThere are now optional challenges, mini-games, and bounties that the game gives players across the chapters, providing some form of exploration and rewarding aspects to the game to better appreciate the environment and offer extra gameplay content.\r\nThe game is beginner friendly\r\nThere are many quality of life improvements in Resident Evil 4 compared to the original 2005 game and even the recent Resident Evil 2 remake. Since Leon is now a trained agent, he can now engage in devastating melee combat unlike when he was a rookie cop who just knew how to use knives.\r\nHe can also now counter and parry enemy attacks and easily turn the tide if enemies manage to close the gap. There is also an added stealth kill to further give players options as to how to approach new areas. You may want to thin out their numbers before engaging, or perhaps you just want to conserve ammo. However this mechanic is severely underutilized and its use fades away as you go deeper into the game.\r\nThe game also gives us many accessible settings when it comes to the controls and progression. Like the other remakes, there is now a snappy aim assist option which tremendously helps gamepad users, although the laser targeting that was present in the original is gone from the start and now needs unlocking. There is also an auto-save system now that is more convenient than the manual saves done in typewriters.\r\nOverall, these major changes make the gameplay more fluid and convenient than ever, and gives players more freedom than in any of the recent Resident Evil titles, while still preserving that core Resident Evil 4 gameplay.\r\nHowever, this buff to the main character also comes with caveats, especially with some buffs to enemies; now with more unpredictable animations that will make aiming – especially to the head — very challenging, they can lay down bear traps in the middle of a confrontation; catching players off guard, as well adding a durability mechanic to Leon’s knife – repairable by the merchant -– that will encourage you to conserve it use as much as possible.\r\nAgain with the shift to the more realistic tone, the gameplay is also more serious than the classic, with a more grounded action and none of the absurd quick time and over-the-top style of action that Resident Evil 4 started on and unfortunately took too far with its later games. Gone are the boulders, killer lasers, and long drawn out action fight scenes.  But there are still action-packed set pieces when the narrative calls for it.\r\nThey really nailed the atmosphere of this game, and the survivor horror roots they went back into is retained, not leaning heavily towards the action gameplay it already left years ago. The hallways and interiors are way darker and scarier than ever, the environments are more gritty and dirtier than I remember. The violence is also made more gruesome with more detailed blood and guts put into it.\r\nEven If I have played the original before and beat it multiple times, this still feels like a fresh experience that I was compelled to play from start to end with a laser focus.\r\nHaving said these positive points, it is important to note that the game is missing the amazing side-campaign Seperate Ways that show the character Ada Wong's perspective of the whole story, and the less important minigame Assignment: Ada.\r\nTechnical Performance:\r\nResident Evil 4 is a very optimized game that resulted in stable above 60 FPS performances all across the board with my specs (i7-8700k, 32GB, RTX 3080 @ 1440p). I also tested it on the Steam Deck and it can provide a consistent 45FPS performance at recommended graphic settings. (Although a 30fps lock is recommended). This is not surprising considering the RE Engine has performed so well in its past games that I’ve played. No DLSS support unfortunately but FSR is present.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4925421) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "I tried out Flash Party recently, coinciding with the recent update Season 9 and I got to say, after going in blind in playing it, the graphics and gameplay actually wowed me. I am using an old 2018 flagship android phone to play it and the visuals still look crisp and nice with console levels of quality that even looks better than the Switch’s own Super Smash Bros.\r\nThe gameplay is very similar to Super Smash Bros. In Flash Party, players get matched up with other players in either 1v1, 2v2, or free for all 4 player matches (either ranked or unranked), and the whole goal of the game is to knock the opposition out of the arena and to deplete their stars by pushing them off the edge of the arena by using various types of attacks. For newcomers like me, Flash Party is pretty straightforward to learn, with an interactive tutorial that can introduce you to the basics in just a few minutes and get you ready for matches in no time.\r\nPlayers get two kinds of attacks, regular and skill attacks. Each can be performed in four different directions. The touch control scheme is nicely implemented, allowing for swipe gestures with the attack buttons instead of purely relying on movement directions. The jumping is a little bit harder to control, because of the fear of falling, but it doesn’t take long to get used to it.\r\nThe combat is a lot of fun, and the mechanic of having to push your enemies off the ledges and edges make for a frantic gameplay action that is a nice change of scenery from the usual health bar mechanic that other fighting games have. The option to team up in 4 player matches also adds a lot to the mayhem and fun factor and allows players to team up with a friend.\r\nFlash Party features a roster of more than 20 characters each with their different move sets, abilities, and cosmetics that you can unlock and purchase. Most of the characters themselves are locked at the start and players can unlock some of them via playing the game or by purchasing some from the hero shop.\r\nAs part of being a free-to-play live-service offering, Flash Party also frequently releases updates that equate into different Seasons, with the most recent one being Season 9 titled “Wheel of Destiny”. Season 9 adds new sets of skins, a new Dojo system feature (the much awaited clan-like system), along with a new Party Pass for players to conquer.\r\nSo far, Flash Party has been one of my favorites of all the recent mobile games that I’ve tried. Its fun combat, easy controls, and pleasing visuals make it a stand out among other fighting games. This is a game that I can see myself regularly playing, especially on the go.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "One handed gameplay, increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Six weapons all at once, all attacking simultaneously. That’s the basic gist of Brotato. For those familiar with the game Vampire Survivors, Brotato is essentially a welcome clone.\r\nBoth games are in the same genre of bullet-hell survival one handed roguelite games, but the two games couldn’t be more different from each other that Brotato stands well out on its own —- It has its own set of weapons, rules, mechanics, and progression design that make it a compelling alternative, or perhaps an even better game than Vampire Survivors.\r\nBrotato is a gameplay first, ask questions later type of game. There is no story, no tutorials, but the game is relatively easy to pick up. Players select a Potato-looking character class out of the starting five (with more unlockable via progression), a starting weapon, and then unleashed upon the rectangular combat arena where they need to fend off alien monsters for a limited time and survive the wave.\r\nAfter each wave ends, there is a short break, with the possibility of getting randomly upgraded by way of leveling to increase stats and purchasing to acquire weapons and items. This is as long as players have the resources — both obtainable by killing alien monsters — to level up or do purchases. Starting from one, up to six weapons can be held at the same time and everything attacks automatically with no buttons required. (the Potato has six hands apparently).\r\nBrotato is an action-packed game top to bottom. As mentioned before, it boasts up to six weapons all firing and attacking simultaneously. That means SMGs, Rocket Launchers, Swords, Wands, can all be equipped by the character and used all at the same time. It results in a highly satisfying monster killing display that never gets boring. In addition, The sound effects are potent and the impacts are visually appealing, especially when you have hordes of alie monsters coming at you getting squashed, sliced, shot, and exploded by your unconventional combination of weapons.\r\nIn a rogue-lite manner, everything is reset upon dying, with the exception of unlocked characters and higher difficulty settings. and it’s not a very easy game to master. While killing aliens is simple enough to be done in one hand, dying is just as easy too, only requiring a few surprising hits and before you know it, you’re dead. I can’t count the times that I’ve unexpectedly died in this game due to one overconfident move or a careless misstep.\r\nWith this Android and iOS release, Brotato is looking better than ever and one of the best premium games for the Mobile platform right now. It’s fun, it's engaging, and it’s very cheap at $5.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

Whereas the main objective of the game is not to build a huge bustling city, but instead to build a natural living world without any trace of technology or artificiality? Terra Nil is exactly that game for a change. A strategy game where players construct and deconstruct terraforming structures with the ultimate goal of restoring the land.\r\nPlayers start off with a simple plot of procedurally generated desolate wasteland. It’s completely dead. It’s up to them to completely restore it to life, in small little steps up to a resulting beautiful landscape complete with thriving flora and fauna.\r\nOne of the things that got me hooked immediately was the therapeutic aspect. The handpainted Sim City 4-looking visuals look beautiful, there’s something in the art style that is highly mesmerizing. It’s a very soothing experience, coupled with a highly relaxing ambient music, it’s a tranquillizing game that just fits perfectly with what it advocates.\r\nThe main gameplay is divided into three main phases that overlap each other. biome restoration, flora growth, and animal reintroduction. All of these phases are subdivided into multiple small steps and milestones that players have to check and complete. In parallel to this, players will also do some climate modification to change the humidity and temperature which affects the potency of other terraforming structures and how they affect their surroundings.\r\nThe players start off building structures that restore the soil into plain grassy fields and reintroduces water to dry channels. It is a challenging task because there’s a limited amount of area where players can build power sources and structures. Then, once the whole map is filled with green fields, the second phase starts.\r\nPlayers will now need to grow enough plants and fruits filling the map. Different plants and fruits will grow depending on the terrain and structures made, and it is quite lovely seeing these plain green fields and once dead rivers slowly growing more life into it.\r\nConcurrently, players will also be able to manipulate the weather by introducing some cloud seeding to increase humidity or starting wildfires to increase the ambient temperatures. This game highly emphasizes destruction and de-creation in order to make progress. Not everything is supposed to be permanent or constantly growing, this will be more prevalent in the last phase.\r\nThe last phase focuses on Animal reintroduction, where players will need to find a suitable habitat for the animals. It’s almost the simplest phase to manage, except players will also need to recycle every artificial structure they’ve built so far, by building recycling centers and an airship to leave the map. Leaving no trace once done.\r\nThere are three difficulties in Terra Nil and I dare say it is a very hardcore game of sorts despite the simplicity in the goal. There are no saves, with the only convenience in the form of a limited rewind option (only rewinds to the last made move). Terra Nil is hard, your resources are limited and how you efficiently utilize it to restore the land will determine your success. It somehow becomes a puzzle game in disguise, especially in normal and hard difficulties.\r\nFor example, you need to continually spend resources to keep building structures, but there is no passive income. Luckily, the structures when built, will give resource rebates if the placing is restorative enough. However, this may not be a good thing as frequent consecutive bad placings will inevitably exhaust your resources, placing you at a complete dead end. As a result, restarts and do-overs are an intended part of the gameplay experience.\r\nIn addition to the land restoration aspect. There is also an over world element with the overarching goal of restoring the ENTIRE planet. The planet is divided into different regions and that regions into different zones of lands represented by percentages that players need to complete. Entering a new zone will start a new “run” where players are placed in a brand new wasteland map that they will need to restore.

Restore some more, encounter different kinds of terrains; rivers, mountains, oceans, etc., Until the whole planet is 100% restored. It is quite short, and is completely beatable in one sitting (if you count restoring the whole planet as beating the game). I kind of wish there was more content for its price ($25) aside from being procedurally generated.\r\nIn all honesty, games like this that help teach and raise awareness about the environment should be given more attention. Maybe these types of games are what we need – especially for youngsters — to instill that mindset that we need to be environmentally aware and take care of our planet more.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4965987) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Flash Party is a platformer fighting game developed by XD and is released free-to-play for both Android and PC platforms, featuring a gameplay inspired by Super Smash Bros., with its own original characters and live-service element.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Console level visuals\r\n- Fun combat\r\n- cross platform play with PC and Mobile## Cons\r\n-Progression system (especially unlocking characters) seemed a little bit grindy\r\nI tried out Flash Party recently, coinciding with the recent update Season 9 and I got to say, after going in blind in playing it, the graphics and gameplay actually wowed me. I am using an old 2018 flagship android phone to play it and the visuals still look crisp and nice with console levels of quality that even looks better than the Switch’s own Super Smash Bros.\r\nDespite being heavily inspired by Nintendo’s Smash Bros, Flash Party features original characters with a stylized cartoonish aesthetic to go along with it. The visuals are actually amazing and the gameplay — mostly pertaining to the combat — was done really well.\r\nThe gameplay is very similar to Super Smash Bros. In Flash Party, players get matched up with other players in either 1v1, 2v2, or free for all 4 player matches (either ranked or unranked), and the whole goal of the game is to knock the opposition out of the arena and to deplete their stars by pushing them off the edge of the arena by using various types of attacks.\r\nFor newcomers like me, Flash Party is pretty straightforward to learn, with an interactive tutorial that can introduce you to the basics in just a few minutes and get you ready for matches in no time. I mainly played the Mobile version, but I’ve tried the PC version as well and it features an additional “Local Versus” game mode that allows for local shared screen multiplayer.\r\nAs for knocking enemies off the map, players can approach this in two ways, by making launching off the map naturally, or by filling up their “damage percentage” to the point that they launch off the map at the slightest touch — damages will build up a percentage meter that affects the throwback effect that character gets, the higher the percentage, the farther the throw.\r\nPlayers get two kinds of attacks, regular and skill attacks. Each can be performed in four different directions. The touch control scheme is nicely implemented, allowing for swipe gestures with the attack buttons instead of purely relying on movement directions. The jumping is a little bit harder to control, because of the fear of falling, but it doesn’t take long to get used to it.\r\nSpeaking of controls, aside from the highly customizable touch controls, Flash Party also features physical controller support, with customizable bindings as well. I’ve personally tested it with my Razer Kishi gamepad, and it works flawlessly. The ability to set bindings is a real game changer that sets this game apart from most mobile games that just offer basic non-customizable controls or none at all.\r\nThe combat is a lot of fun, and the mechanic of having to push your enemies off the ledges and edges make for a frantic gameplay action that is a nice change of scenery from the usual health bar mechanic that other fighting games have. The option to team up in 4 player matches also adds a lot to the mayhem and fun factor and allows players to team up with a friend.\r\nFlash Party features a roster of more than 20 characters each with their different movesets, abilities, and cosmetics that you can unlock and purchase. Most of the characters themselves are locked at the start and players can unlock some of them via playing the game or by purchasing some from the hero shop. In addition to the cosmetics, there are also visual effects for KO’s, respawns, and emotes that players can collect. However unlocking characters will take time, and without paying, you’re mostly stuck with the first few characters for quite a while.\r\nThese original characters are grouped into four different classes, offering players different ways to fight depending on their preferred playstyle. For example, one focuses on countering shields, another focuses on combos. One focuses on counter-attacks, another focuses on burst attacks.\r\nAs part of being a free-to-play live-service offering, Flash Party also frequently releases updates that equate into different Seasons, with the most recent one being Season 9 titled “Wheel of Destiny”. Season 9 adds new sets of skins, a new Dojo system feature (the much awaited clan-like system), along with a new Party Pass for players to conquer.\r\nSeason 9 adds new skins for Cupid, Tina, Sophia, Mr. 5, Alice, and Sivi, as well as expanding the game with the aforementioned Dojo feature which allows players and friends to gather in one area, participate in group missions, engage in private chat channels and leaderboards.\r\nIt has the potential to be PC and Mobile’s very own Super Smash Bros. especially if it continues to get support and improve. With the recent Season 9 update, this seems like a perfect time to try out this game or come back to it.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4966022) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Brotato is a survival roguelite wave shooter playable with one hand. Originally released for PCs as an early access, it has now been recently released on Android and iOS as a full title, after going into an open beta just recently. This mobile release brings the game closer to feature parity with the existing PC version.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Surprisingly addicting gameplay loop\r\n- action-packed and fast paced gameplay\r\n- Mindless fun, can play with just one hand\r\n- A plethora of weapons and items to experiment with\r\n- One of the best alternatives to Vampire Survivors## Cons\r\n-No cons\r\nOne handed gameplay, increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Six weapons all at once, all attacking simultaneously. That’s the basic gist of Brotato. For those familiar with the game Vampire Survivors, Brotato is essentially a welcome clone. Both are in the same genre of bullet-hell survival one handed roguelite games, but the two games couldn’t be more different from each other that Brotato stands well out on its own —- Brotato has its own set of weapons, rules, mechanics, and progression design that make it a compelling alternative, or perhaps an even better game than Vampire Survivors.\r\nIn contrast to Vampire Survivors’ pixelated retro art design, the visuals of Brotato overall are charming and appealing, despite being in 2D as well. It reminded me of these old flash games with its cartoonish graphics and clean looking color palettes, and it serves its purpose well by providing a clean look to the player and helping shift the main focus into the gameplay.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nBrotato is a gameplay first, ask questions later type of game. There is no story, no tutorials, but the game is relatively easy to pick up. Players select a Potato-looking character class out of the starting five (with more unlockable via progression), a starting weapon, and then unleashed upon the rectangular combat arena where they need to fend off alien monsters for a limited time and survive the wave.\r\nGet upgrades in-between waves of alien monsters\r\nAfter each wave ends, there is a short break, with the possibility of getting randomly upgraded by way of leveling to increase stats and purchasing to acquire weapons and items. This is as long as players have the resources — both obtainable by killing alien monsters — to level up or do purchases. Starting from one, up to six weapons can be held at the same time and everything attacks automatically with no buttons required. (the Potato has six hands apparently).\r\nThese character classes each have different attributes and starting weapons to them that can cater to many different playstyles and can provide some flavor to the game. One character may be hyper focused on melee gameplay, while one gets bonuses with ranged weapons. Another character may prefer elemental damage weapons, and another will have a massive XP bonus at the expense of more expensive items.\r\nWeapons for every occassion\r\nFor the weapons, these range from the typical modern guns like Pistols, SMGs, and Sci-fi guns like Laser and Healing guns, to more absurd concepts like Fists, Wands, Swords, and Sticks. Almost every weapon archetype is present, no matter the genre or time period, which gives Brotato a highly varied selection of weapons for players to consider.\r\nYou can also upgrade these weapons by either acquiring a better one from the shop, or combining two same color rarities to form a higher colored one. If you’ve played the open beta last month, there are a lot of weapons added and many of them have been rebalanced to provide a much smoother experience.\r\nThis potato has six hands\r\nBrotato is an action-packed game top to bottom. As mentioned before, it boasts up to six weapons all firing and attacking simultaneously. That means SMGs, Rocket Launchers, Swords, Wands, can all be equipped by the character and used all at the same time. It results in a highly satisfying monster killing display that never gets boring. In addition, The sound effects are potent and the impacts are visually appealing, especially when you have hordes of alie monsters coming at you getting squashed, sliced, shot, and exploded by your unconventional combination of weapons.\r\nEasy to kill, easy to die\r\nIn a rogue-lite manner, everything is reset upon dying, with the exception of unlocked characters and higher difficulty settings. and it’s not a very easy game to master. While killing aliens is simple enough to be done in one hand, dying is just as easy too, only requiring a few surprising hits and before you know it, you’re dead. I can’t count the times that I’ve unexpectedly died in this game due to one overconfident move or a careless misstep.\r\nHowever, deaths does not stop this game from becoming incredibly addicting, in fact it even makes it much more so. The gameplay loop of wanting to conquer more waves and higher difficulties, trying out other builds and weapon combos, makes for a very highly attractive gameplay experience.\r\nAt wave 20, there is a health spongey boss fight that you must beat to clear the run, there are random alien monsters appearing too, so by wave 20, the player character must be well prepared by then. All in all, expect runs to last around 15 to 30 minutes at a time. Perfect for playing on the go and on mobile phones more so than on PCs.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4965872) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It is catered more to the mobile platform market — a first in the series, and is now currently in beta (Android) available for China. A PC version is also available for testing, it is a full-on game client and not an emulated Android version.\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the series, The gameplay setup of Persona 5: The Phantom X or the Persona game series as a whole centers on the main protagonist and his group of friends being \"Persona\" users – individuals granted the ability to summon \"Persona beings\" with special powers.\r\nIn line with the theme of the series, the protagonist will need to balance his normal life (slice of life gameplay) along with his supernatural monster killing second life, usually done at night in the realm called the Metaverse. This double life is basically the most alluring part of Persona for me and what makes it stand out from the rest of the JRPGs out there.\r\nThe gameplay of P5: The Phantom X is adapted for mobile touch controls and partially simplified, while still featuring the core elements from the series. Again at start, we’re back to high school, roaming around town, interacting with friends and classmates, while being slowly introduced to the Persona powers the protagonist will soon awaken and unlock. When the characters are not roaming around high-school and town at day living their daily lives, they are battling monsters at the Metaverse with a turn-based combat system.\r\nThe turn-based combat features a traditional JRPG system, where combatants just take turns attacking each other. What’s special about this is that aside from normal attacks, the characters can summon their Personas that each have powerful abilities. Healing, Magical Debuffs, Buffs, All kinds of elemental and physical attacks, are all possible when using Personas, and they can either use up the character's SP or HP. It’s still as fun and visually appealing as any Persona game, and I’m glad they are not toning down the presentation for this spin-off.\r\nPersona 5: The Phantom X actually looks surprisingly amazing for a mobile title. The smooth cel-shaded art style is back and the soundtrack still feels very Persona-ish with its upbeat music and jazz/rock elements. Many of the UI elements and background music are even copy-pasted from P5 and for good reason.  If you actually show this to a Persona fan without revealing the title, they could actually mistake this for an actual Persona 6 gameplay and not a mobile game, that’s how good the game looks visually compared to the original mainline game.\r\nAs for mobile centric-elements, the game will be free-to-play at the trade-off of having live service and gacha elements. There will be new animations, skins, and weapons that are all part of the gacha system, as well as the ability to acquire tiered Personas and Characters (including the original Persona 5 characters). Personas can still drop after battles and be fused, but are entirely separated from gacha-obtained Personas.\r\nThe game is currently in Chinese localization for now, with Japanese voice overs, but I am hoping for a global beta or even a release soon. So far I like the direction the game is going, it still feels very much like Persona but I can also notice the free-to-play effects kicking in. I do hope it’s well balanced enough to be enjoyable for both free-to-play and premium players once it is released.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4965827) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Especially for our space-faring fans that love great narrative experiences, Crying Suns offers an experience that is likely worth their time and money, $9 of it to be exact.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4980744) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Crying Suns is a tactical rogue-lite strategy game with heavy narrative elements and a focus on exploration. It was originally released on PCs but has now since been ported to the Mobile platform. For this article I will be playing the mobile version.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Immersive role playing elements\r\n- Dynamic storytelling\r\n- Excellent writing as a sci-fi story\r\n- High degree of replayability## Cons\r\n-Small UI elements and text for mobile phones\r\n-Combat can get repetitive\r\nCrying Suns’ narrative themes are boasted as having been inspired by Dune and Foundation, in which for any hardcore sci-fi fans, know that this is probably two of the best source materials a story could be inspired by.\r\nAn intriguing premise to spur our curiosity\r\nThe main story premise is that the game's protagonist, Admiral Ellys Idaho, or rather a clone of him, is awoken by the last surviving OMNI named Kaliban— AIs originally built to enable mankind to run a galactic empire. They both soon find out that Kaliban is the last of his kind and that the Empire has collapsed and is in shambles, prompting the duo to embark on a journey to find out what happened.\r\nFrom the moment players start the game, they are drawn into a richly detailed world that is full of mystery and intrigue. The gripping story unfolds slowly, with each new sector of space revealing more about the events that led to the empire's collapse. The writing is excellent, with a cast of memorable characters and a deep lore that rewards exploration and attention to detail.\r\nAs said previously, the story is very intriguing from the very start, the introduction scenes and the simplistic pixel art but fluidly animated sequences really helped sell the premise and gave its game an indie charm. However, I found the dialogue and UI texts with its tiny fonts to be a bit cumbersome to read, especially on a mobile phone.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay in Crying Suns revolves around managing a fleet of ships through various sectors of space, upgrading them, and engaging in tactical battles against enemy fleets. The mobile version of the game has kept the gameplay mechanics intact, and players will still have to make strategic decisions about how to allocate their resources and which battles to engage in, now with just touchscreen controls.\r\nCrying Suns’ gameplay is split into two core components: exploration and combat. In the exploration phase, you navigate your fleet through a series of sectors, each containing a number of nodes and featuring a role-playing aspect with randomized events and decision-making. This is a highly immersive experience and really involves the player and makes them feel like they are part of an emerging dynamic storyline.  I really felt like I was a captain on my ship sending a science team down to the planet’s surface.\r\nIt feels like turn-based but its in real-time\r\nIn the combat phase, you engage in real-time but pauseable battles with enemy fleets. Combat takes place on a grid-based map, with the ships occupying one or more hex tiles. Now this is a highly tactical experience that will challenge players as to how to utilize their units, and their different strengths and weaknesses. It’s not overly complex, and can get a bit repetitive at times, but it’s overall a fun element to experience when coupled with the amazing dynamic storytelling.\r\nImmersive exploration\r\nIn exploration, each node can be a planet, a ship, a distress signal, or other types of events. The sector is randomly generated for each playthrough, adding to the game's replayability. At each node, players will encounter a text-based event that can have a variety of outcomes, depending on the choices they make. They may encounter friendly ships that offer to join the fleet, hostile ships that attack immediately, or neutral events that give players resources or information. Some events may also have branching paths, leading to different outcomes or rewards.\r\nAdditionally, Players must use the fleet's resources, including fuel, supplies, and scrap. Fuel and supplies are necessary to travel between nodes and repair damaged ships, respectively. Scrap can be used to upgrade ships or purchase new equipment.\r\nIn combat, each ship has a set of abilities and weapons, such as lasers, missiles, or drones, that can be used to damage enemy ships or provide support to allied ships. At any time, players select a ship and choose its action, such as moving to a different tile, attacking an enemy ship, or using an ability. There are three systems to manage: Squadron, Weapon and Hull, and players can assign officers each with their own special abilities and bonuses.\r\nTouchscreen adaptation\r\nThe mobile version of Crying Suns has been designed with touch controls in mind. Players can swipe to move between screens, tap and hold on icons to access menus, and pinch to zoom in and out. The controls are generally intuitive, but I can’t help but notice many of the UI elements are too small to accurately click on mobile phones.\r\nRogue-lite elements\r\nAs a rogue-lite game, Crying Suns offers a high level of challenge and replayability. Each playthrough is different, with randomly generated sectors and encounters keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting. There are multiple chapters in it and progress is saved after each one, so no need to fully restart the game like a true rogue-like. The game also features multiple endings, each with its own set of conditions and requirements, adding to the game's replay value.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/4987241) Originally posted on TapTap.",

However, the gameplay setup is very much different from each other, especially with Road 96: Mile 0’s focus on a more fixed narrative, coupled with musical and rhythm themes.\r\nI have been eyeing the first game; Road 96, for a while now. As such, I played it first before diving down to Road 96: Mile 0, and both games have been such amazing but way differing experiences. To compare, the gameplay of Road 96: Mile 0 is much more non-procedural and linear, with less survival aspects. But with added rhythm and mini-game elements.\r\nThe story follows bestfriends Zoe and Kaito in a grounded dystopian adventure with a whimsical spin to it. Zoe is the daughter of a high-ranking government official frustrated with her pampered but tightly controlled life, and Kaito is from a less fortunate class who is looking for things to change. Their relationship dynamics are tested by their widely different backgrounds and initial beliefs, as well as the events that will unfold in the game leading up to the original Road 96.\r\nThe gameplay in Road 96: Mile 0 is for the most part roaming around areas, interacting with people and objects, which usually boils down to making a hard choice. Some inconsequential, some heavily affecting the outcome of the story. Handing off a big responsibility to the player in how the story goes and deeply immersing them.\r\nEvery now and then, the gameplay is injected with fun and amusing mini-games, mostly being the skateboarding/rolling skating rhythm game setpieces for each and every level with a matching masterpiece of a music that embodies the 90’s feeling perfectly.\r\nSome of the other mini-games are a bit too cheesy and stylized, such as shooting newspapers to bystanders to symbolize its distribution or hammering nails to planks in a rhythm game fashion to symbolize building a wooden contraption. Ultimately, they are all still mostly fun and add a lot of variety to an otherwise monotonous gameplay full of walking and dialogue choices.\r\nOverall, I had fun playing the first parts of Road 96: Mile 0. From the start, it is already a very compelling adventure game with its cool musical, mini-game segments and the ensuing intriguing political narrative. If you have already played the first game, you will appreciate the story even more. If not, then the musical aspect might grab your attention instead.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "BUMP! Superbrawl’s concept is simple. Predict the enemies movements, one turn, one hero at a time and win the match. Either by scoring higher or knocking their heroes out, every match is very exciting and satisfying to win.\r\nA team of three assorted heroes plus three in reserve is commanded by the player and pitted against another team in 1v1 competitive matches. The gameplay is relatively simple. Players are only allowed one character to move per turn, and the only action they can do is to move their character and attack in a certain direction right after (depending on the character). After only 1 to 2 rounds of gameplay, I already got the concept and was already ready for some serious battle.\r\nAfter a turn is confirmed, both sides' moves will play out at the same time, leading to some interesting predictive combat movements — kind of like Battleship — either you hit enemy units, he hits yours, or both hit each other. Each hero will have HP that when depleted, will cause them to get knocked out and replaced by their reserve hero.\r\nThen, the characters who just performed the moves will have to rest for 1 round, giving the floor off to the other two of the players’ characters. It leads to some strategic positional gameplay, where you leave your heroes to rest will matter as well. It can make them vulnerable, or you can use them as bait for other heroes to utilize\r\nThere are many different game modes and levels to play in that are unlockable. Each with their own gimmicks that will mean a different objective or map elements to utilize. Pure KO matches, exploding and poison barrels littering the map, a capture the “zone” game mode, a coin gathering game mode, and much more. The levels are also rotating every certain amount of hours, so not all sessions are the same every day. Making the game highly varied on a day to day basis.\r\nThe progression overall — free-to-play wise — felt very accessible and easy to advance in. In my first few hours of play I already unlocked quite a few heroes of my own, as opposed to other games locking you to a specific set of heroes for a long time, unless you can spend real money. The levels are also locked at the start but are easily obtainable.\r\nAs I said, After only 1 to 2 rounds of gameplay, I already got the concept and was already ready for some serious battle, BUMP! Superbrawl is that easy to pick-up. Mastering the predictive turn-based combat however, is another story. Coupled with the welcoming progression system that doesn't really feel grindy and the lack of play limiting systems in place, BUMP! Superbrawl is indeed a very enticing game that our strategic-inclined mobile gamers might enjoy all day.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "In Hero Legacy: Adventure RPG, you are a legendary hero who is the son of the former king, destined to rebuild your kingdom and vanish the enemies that threaten the land.\r\nStarting out Hero Legacy: Adventure RPG, I was immediately introduced to the grand exploration / dungeon crawling gameplay set in a hexagonal grid based map, populated by monsters, loot, and resources to conquer. Navigation is easy, just touch what tile to move to and it will immediately interact with it either by gathering the resource or loot, or entering combat with hostile units in that area, if any.\r\nDespite the pretty rudimentary visual design of the world, the map is so immense, at the start, you can already see the huge stretch of the world that will be available for you to explore.\r\nEven in the real-time combat, they’re really doubling down on the tile grid layout. With all the character and enemy units being now square tile portraits just bobbing around throwing projectiles and slash effects to signify ranged and melee attacks. And for all intent and purposes, the whole setup is still somehow visually appealing and absorbing to play in its own way.\r\nThe main special ability of the player character is the ability to summon ancestral heroes to use them for battle in what seems like a pokemon or card-game like approach to collecting heroes, complete with a tier system. Similar to the elemental-based enemies, heroes will also align to one or two elements with matching abilities that can be used to your advantage.\r\nPretty early in the game, the city building aspect is introduced which adds another engaging core gameplay element. Players can seamlessly travel between the  “exploration” world map and the city building aspect. Resources looted from the world map  — that are replenished every few real world days —  are used to build structures and these structures can upgrade certain aspects of your hero, like melee and ranged damage.\r\nThere is a questing system in place and players can either follow the two main quests for the exploration and city building, and also take on side-quests and daily quests that will give off more additional loot and resources, adding both narrative and gameplay stimulation to the player and the character.\r\nThe overall experience of my initial playthrough of Hero Legacy: Adventure RPG was only mildly enjoyable. As much as I wanted to play more, I have experienced various sluggish performances that hindered my ability to enjoy the deeper parts of the game. Regardless, I plan to continue playing this game for a while, and I do hope they fix these issues.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

The Last Shop - Craft & Trade will exactly let you experience being one. Build a store, receive raw materials, commission goods like weapons and armor to display at your shop. Heroes and adventurers will flock to your store looking for valuable goods to purchase, and it’s up to the player to sell and earn money.\r\nThe gameplay of The Last Shop - Craft & Trade banks heavily on the addictive nature of earning money, and so far it works so well. This is done by continually selling goods to adventurers in an ever increasing cycle of crafting increasingly better items, in turn selling for more and more money.\r\nThe tutorial is a bit long-winded, It was a bit of an information overload, but it holds your hand and strictly guides you throughout much of the many systems in place. I started off by putting a bunch of display racks that can store items for sale. Then, I also set up a storage for my raw materials. After that, I just crafted my first few items to sell and they’re up there in the display and a customer came and asked for it immediately. The process is simple but it can get addicting quickly.\r\nAside from managing a store, you can also hire heroes for yourself and order them to go on quests to the outside world for potential rewards. You can also view the city you’re in and sort of “invest” in the different infrastructures in there to get different boosts, such as an increased raw material production or a faster cooldown rate for your heroes.\r\nSince Last Shop - Craft & Trade is free-to-play, there are a lot of in-game purchases available. From simple premium currency top-ups, to increased drop rate for a whole year. Like the merchant game that it is, the whole game is littered with things to spend real money on.\r\nSo far, the experience is borderline addicting. Well, that’s a given since the core gameplay mechanic of  Last Shop - Craft & Trade is about selling things and earning huge amounts of money. However, the constant need for manual check-ins, restocks, and manual selling gets a bit tiresome after a while.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

However, the gameplay setup is very much different from each other, especially with Road 96: Mile 0’s focus on a more fixed narrative, coupled with musical and rhythm themes.\r\nI have been eyeing the first game; Road 96, for a while now. As such, I played it first before diving down to Road 96: Mile 0, and both games have been such amazing but way differing experiences, one more so than the other. More on that later.\r\nPlayed or have not played Road 96?\r\nFor those who haven’t played Road 96; you can clearly play this one first to gain a better background to Road 96 if you play on playing that later, however you might miss some of the subtle references this game has and be exposed to some minor spoilers. You couldn’t go wrong in choosing what to play first.\r\nFor those who have played Road 96, this game is a highly focused game narrative and gameplay wise that adds more to the game series’ lore and background. The narrative has now shifted into two main playable characters – one we already know and love — and the gameplay is much more non-procedural and linear, with less survival aspects. But with added rhythm and mini-game elements.\r\nSplit Worlds\r\nThe story follows bestfriends Zoe and Kaito in a grounded dystopian adventure with a whimsical spin to it. Zoe is the daughter of a high-ranking government official frustrated with her pampered but tightly controlled life, and Kaito is from a less fortunate class who is looking for things to change. Their relationship dynamics are tested by their widely different backgrounds and initial beliefs, as well as the events that will unfold in the game leading up to the original Road 96. Different choices can and will affect the two characters, especially their beliefs. For the better, or for worse.\r\nThe story is now more fixed and linear, due to the fact that it’s a prequel, forcing the developers to keep the canon in-line with their previous game. However this does not stop Road 96: Mile 0 from giving players choices and a great thought-provoking narrative ride overall.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay in Road 96: Mile 0 is for the most part roaming around areas, interacting with people and objects, which usually boils down to making a hard choice. Some inconsequential, some heavily affecting the outcome of the story. Handing off a big responsibility to the player in how the story goes and deeply immersing them.\r\nEvery now and then, the gameplay is injected with fun and amusing mini-games and puzzles, mostly being the skateboarding/rolling skating rhythm game setpieces for each and every level with a matching masterpiece of a music that embodies the 90’s feeling perfectly.\r\nThe soundtrack is amazingly catchy and it even immediately set me off on a googling journey to find the OST and listen to it outside playing the game. It also fits the narrative theme of the game quite perfectly with its 90s lyrics and aesthetic to it.\r\nSome of the other mini-games are a bit too cheesy and stylized, such as shooting newspapers to bystanders to symbolize its distribution or hammering nails to planks in a rhythm game fashion to symbolize building a wooden contraption. Ultimately, they are all still mostly fun and add a lot of variety to an otherwise monotonous gameplay full of walking and dialogue choices.\r\nOverall, I had fun playing the first parts of Road 96: Mile 0. From the start, it is already a very compelling adventure game with its cool musical, mini-game segments and the ensuing intriguing political narrative. If you have already played the first game, you will appreciate the story even more. If not, then the musical aspect might grab your attention instead.\r\nAmazingly crafted rhythm game setpieces\r\nIt seemed kind of out of place especially with all the first-person roaming around in-between, but the rhythm game component that even scores your runs and allows you to replay it to beat the high-score is a highly compelling gameplay aspect that is ironically the best main movers of the story for me. It’s just really fun and charming to see these stylized setpieces come into play and I was always excited to finish the levels to be able to play the next segment. Overall, expect Road 96: Mile 0 to be beaten in under four hours. It’s pretty short, but an incredible short ride nonetheless.\r\nTechnical Analysis\r\nThe graphics are heavily stylized with handpainted aesthetics, and have slightly improved over the first game. However I can’t help but notice the poor performance I am having with some stutters, considering that the game is not visually demanding and I have a decent setup (i7-8700k, 32GB, RTX 3080). The hardware isn't really being utilized in some cases and the game needs a bit of optimization to run more smoothly. Regardless, this is the type of game that doesn’t really require a flawless performance to be enjoyable, with its somewhat light control elements and a focus on narrative over gameplay.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5034578) Originally posted on TapTap.",

In combat, there aren’t even character sprites, instead only game pieces for a supposed hexagonal grid board game, but don’t get turned off. After a while there is a sort of an acquired taste that improves after a while.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nStarting out Hero Legacy: Adventure RPG, I was immediately introduced to the grand exploration / dungeon crawling gameplay set in a hexagonal grid based map, populated by monsters, loot, and resources to conquer.

With all the character and enemy units being now square tile portraits just bobbing around throwing projectiles and slash effects to signify ranged and melee attacks. And for all intent and purposes, the whole setup is still somehow visually appealing and absorbing to play in its own way.\r\nElemental-based combat system\r\nIn Hero Legacy: Adventure RPG, You battle all sorts of creatures from goblins and orcs to elemental slimes that are subject to different elemental weaknesses. Then comes the city building aspect which is another decent element on its own.\r\nThe main special ability of the player character is the ability to summon ancestral heroes to use them for battle in what seems like a pokemon or card-game like approach to collecting heroes, complete with a tier system. Similar to the elemental-based enemies, heroes will also align to one or two elements with matching abilities that can be used to your advantage.\r\nThe whole combat system is pretty well done and despite the shortcomings in the visual department, it's still engaging to play. The different ancestral heroes will have two main abilities usable in combat, a normal ability with a simple effect and short cooldown, and a special ability with a higher cooldown and a more grandiose effect.\r\nCity Building elements\r\nPretty early in the game, the city building aspect is introduced which adds another engaging core gameplay element. Players can seamlessly travel between the “exploration” world map and the city building aspect. Resources looted from the world map  — that are replenished every few real world days —  are used to build structures and these structures can upgrade certain aspects of your hero, like melee and ranged damage.\r\nTo reach higher tier buildings, you may need to craft and build higher tiered mats and resources. The gameplay loop is just as engaging as its ancestral hero summoning-combat and exploration system, and while the two systems aren’t really that interconnected, they both synergized very well because of the aside resource gathering aspect. Of course, since this game is a free-to-play offering, expect a lot of grinding and real world days of waiting for progression in the mid to later stages. Spending money is encouraged, but not absolutely required.\r\nThere is a questing system in place and players can either follow the two main quests for the exploration and city building, and also take on side-quests and daily quests that will give off more additional loot and resources, adding both narrative and gameplay stimulation to the player and the character.\r\nPerformance woes\r\nAs for the main deal breaker, for me it is the sluggish performance. The game struggles to perform satisfactorily in my experience, compared to other more good looking games in which I’ve had little to no problems. Touch commands are also unresponsive and the game overall is frustrating to control.\r\nMovement commands not being recognized instantly, sudden fade to blacks that will make you second guess if the game crashes, and the game is plagued with constant “waiting for server response” messages for every thing that you do; defeating enemies, picking up loot, or switching to another map. It heavily messes up the flow of the game to the point that it’s game breaking.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5034885) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "BUMP! Superbrawl is a tactical strategy game that pits players’ team of heroes against each other in exciting predictive turn-based matches.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Clever predictive turn-based combat mechanics\r\n- Welcoming progression system\r\n- Cute and adorable visuals and characters## Cons\r\n-Some unresponsiveness in the controls\r\nBUMP! Superbrawl’s concept is simple. Predict the enemies movements, one turn, one hero at a time and win the match. Either by scoring higher or knocking their heroes out, every match is very exciting and satisfying to win.\r\nThe graphics are cute and vibrant, and the characters range from adorable Anthropomorphic animals to chibi-looking warriors and magicians. It feels like a 3D animated movie and the overall aesthetic is quite pleasing to the eyes, even in the heat of the combat with all the effects going in, it’s even more satisfying to see (if you are winning nonetheless).\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nA team of three assorted heroes plus three in reserve is commanded by the player and pitted against another team in 1v1 competitive matches. The gameplay is relatively simple. Players are only allowed one character to move per turn, and the only action they can do is to move their character and attack in a certain direction right after (depending on the character). After only 1 to 2 rounds of gameplay, I already got the concept and was already ready for some serious battle.\r\nAfter a turn is confirmed, both sides' moves will play out at the same time, leading to some interesting predictive combat movements and action — kind of like Battleship — either you hit enemy units, he hits yours, or both hit each other. Each hero will have HP that when depleted, will cause them to get knocked out and replaced by their reserve hero.\r\nUnstoppable force meets an immovable object\r\nAside from the basic movement and attack maneuvers, both characters moving into each other will cause a \"BUMP\" where both moves and attacks are canceled at that position with damages to both. While going past a stationary character will cause a “dash” move where damage is also inflicted, making it possible to inflict damage two times in a single turn.\r\nOne turn cooldown\r\nThen, the characters who just performed the moves will have to rest for 1 round, giving the floor off to the other two of the players’ characters. It leads to some strategic positional gameplay, where you leave your heroes to rest will matter as well. It can make them vulnerable, or you can use them as bait for other heroes to utilize\r\nNo need for fast reflexes and reactions, but you still need to think fast\r\nThis is a unique game that is a much-needed respite from all the countless reaction-based fighting games that favor those who have the better reflexes and muscle memory. BUMP! Superbrawl instead taps the player’s tactical and predictive prowess and only requires simple a move per turn limited by a highly lenient 30 second timer. Although I did encounter some consistent touch control issues especially when trying to rotate the attack direction. There is a bit of unresponsiveness felt and experience that led me into needlessly running out of time on some occasions.\r\nThe different heroes that you can acquire from playing — either from grinding, gacha, or real money — all have different attributes, abilities, and behavior. One may be able to fire long ranged shots but only to a single target; one may fly and avoid ground hazards and shoot in a straight AOE line; and another may serve a tank role at the expense of a short ranged attack.\r\nThe map roster rotates every few hours\r\nThere are many different game modes and levels to play in that are unlockable. Each with their own gimmicks that will mean a different objective or map elements to utilize. Pure KO matches, exploding and poison barrels littering the map, a capture the “zone” game mode, a coin gathering game mode, and much more. The levels are also rotating every certain amount of hours, so not all sessions are the same every day. Making the game highly varied on a day to day basis.\r\nA welcoming live service element\r\nBUMP! Superbrawl is a free-to-play game, as such, there is a live service element in place in the form of gacha and battle pass rewards that give players a faster progression rate and easier unlocks. Fortunately, there are no playtime limiting energy currencies in place, so players can play all day, the only caveat being there are limited bonuses stars you can obtain per day for the battle pass.\r\nThe progression overall — free-to-play wise — felt very accessible and easy to advance in. In my first few hours of play I already unlocked quite a few heroes of my own, as opposed to other games locking you to a specific set of heroes for a long time, unless you can spend real money. The levels are also locked at the start but are easily obtainable.\r\nHeroes get better over time, giving some slight or major advantages.\r\nThe heroes are also all upgradable using various currencies, and each level can give out bonuses like new abilities arising from a set of prerequisite conditions. For example, an unlock ability for a hero might allow him to do an automated free revenge move against those who KO’d their allies, or allow him to charge towards an enemy immediately upon spawning.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5034708) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Doomsland: Survivors is a top down zombie shooter with rogue-lite elements.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A challenging rogue-lite experience\r\n- Interesting combat and random power-ups to select## Cons\r\n-Very hard difficulty even from the start\r\n-Heavy reliance on microtransactions and ads\r\nIt seems that the movement-centric rogue-lite genre is getting a lot of love recently as we have another game in our hands, with the same gameplay concept like the other games I’ve recently reviewed like Mighty Doom or Dark Season. This time — yet again— with zombies.\r\nThe Doomsland: Survivors is a top-down shooter with rogue-lite elements that will leave you on the edge of your seat. From the moment you start playing, you'll be thrown into a world overrun by human zombies and other zombified creatures and mutants, and it's up to you to fight your way through hordes of enemies to survive, one room at a time.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay is fast-paced and intense, with the character automatically firing only when stationary. The only control you have is over your movement and a special attack that slowly reaches 100%, which means you have to constantly dodge and weave your way through enemy fire while taking down as many enemies as possible while stopping. Each level or stage consists of 30 rooms that you must clear one by one, with occasional boss encounters that will put your skills to the test  — or not, because they’re ironically more easier than the actual zombie infested rooms.\r\nNew sets of upgrades and power-ups every run\r\nThe rogue-lite element of the game adds a layer of difficulty and replayability that will keep you coming back for more. Each time you play, you start with a basic gun and basic attack, and must level up by killing enemies. When you level up, you gain access to three randomized upgrade choices that modify how the game plays. These upgrades can range from additional bullets, bouncing bullets, piercing bullets, poison or flame damage, increased health, increased attack speed, and different modifiers depending on remaining HP.\r\nMy pistol is firing five bullets at once, some diagonally and bouncing off walls\r\nAs you progress through The Doomsland: Survivors, the upgrades become increasingly absurd, resulting in a massive bullet hell mayhem that will test your reflexes and quick thinking, and lag the game so much. Ultimately, it is a very satisfying ordeal, especially when the upgrades are all synergistic with each other and the bullets are flying to your advantage.\r\nA level or stage consists of 30 rooms that the player must clear one by one, with occasional boss encounters randomly every few rooms or so. Clearing all 30 rooms will unlock the next level, coming up short (even at room 29) will not unlock the next level and force players to restart from room 1. Every once in a while there are friendly rooms that houses allies offering upgrades to the player such as health boosts or an attack damage buff.\r\nA grueling experience in both the gameplay and progression\r\nThere are persistent elements though in the form of gear upgrade and talent systems that ever so slightly improves character attributes and stats. It's a slow grind, coupled with the game's unforgiving difficulty where you are almost always facing hordes of enemies and bullet hell proportions of projectiles, and the inability to shoot while stationary, makes it a very hard game to progress through. Even at the first level I had a hard time beating all 30 rooms to complete the level. It's a challenging game, and you'll need all the help you can get to progress through all the 16 levels.\r\nLow-key pay to win\r\nFurthermore, the game's heavy reliance on microtransactions and ads can be a bit of a downside. While the game is free-to-play, players will need to spend real money to progress faster or gain immediate access to certain upgrades and items. Even when selecting an upgrade, there is sometimes an option to watch an add to boost the effects of that upgrade. Premium currency called diamonds that can immensely help progression or gacha loot boxes are available to purchased by the player.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5035199) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Evoland 2 is a classic / modern adventure RPG game with a time-traveling theme, not just with the settings, but with whole video game eras and genres altogether.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique alternating blend of different game styles and mechanics across video game history\r\n- Cohesive time-traveling narrative\r\n- Colorful cast of charming characters\r\n- Controller Support## Cons\r\n-Difficult to use touch controls\r\n-Graphics and mechanics changes might feel a bit jarring\r\nDeveloped by Shiro Games and published by Playdigious, Evoland 2 is the standalone sequel to the original Evoland and offers a unique blend of gameplay styles , mechanics, and graphics that evolve as the player progresses. In many ways, Evoland 2 clearly improves upon the first game, especially in the narrative, gameplay department, and length.\r\nA time-traveling narrative\r\nEvoland 2 follows the adventures of a young hero, Kuro (the name can be changed) and his companions as they travel through time and space to save their world from a looming threat.  The game's storyline is an epic and sprawling adventure that spans across different eras and dimensions, taking the player on a journey through time and space.\r\nThe game’s prologue starts off in a Game Boy low resolution green-ish setting, then immediately switches to a much more modern 2D pixel art graphics that serves as the original medieval fantasy setting the main characters are from.  Overall, it sets the tone for the epic adventure to come, with its lighthearted orchestral score and cinematic presentation. There is no voice acting, so everything must be read by the player.\r\nA travel through time, including video game history\r\nAfter a while, it will switch back and forth to different 2D and 3D eras of graphics, as well as the setting evolving to include elements of sci-fi, steampunk, and even post-apocalyptic themes. Throughout the game, players will encounter a colorful cast of charming characters, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay in Evoland 2 is a unique blend of different game styles and mechanics, ranging from classic 2D action-adventure gameplay to turn-based battles and even card games. They are mostly paying homage to RPGs, but other genres are included as well.\r\nThe game's evolution mechanic allows the graphics and gameplay to evolve as the player progresses, starting off with basic 2D graphics and simple gameplay, but gradually evolving to more advanced graphics and complex mechanics, and also going “downgrading” back the graphics, depending on the story progression.\r\nA love letter to classic RPGs and retro games\r\nFrom the 8-bit pixelated graphics and retro soundtrack to the turn-based battles or even side-scrolling shooter action, Evoland 2 pays homage to the history of video games in a way that feels both old and brand new. If you ever want to go on a video game history tour, while still playing a decent game, Evoland 2 is the one and only perfect fit.\r\nThe game never gets stale or boring due to the constant evolutions and gameplay changes along the way. Despite the constant gameplay changes in what feels like demo-ing a bunch of games one at a time, the game’s time-traveling story feels cohesive overall and compelling to play.\r\nWhen Evoland 2 is in a classic Adventure RPG format — which I would probably label as the game’s main genre — the game's combat system is adapted from a Zelda-style combat where players only have one attack button, no dodge, block, nor a variety spells, except for one ability where the current companion comes to the player’s aid.\r\nWhen switched to other eras and genres, the gameplay’s combat switches as well, be it a Final Fantasy-like turn-based system, a side-scrolling platformer, a horizontal shooter, or even a Street Fighter fighting game. Sometimes even adapting more unconventional styles like a card game format or a candy crush battle system.\r\nThe game also features a variety of puzzles and platforming challenges that require critical thinking and logic, and sometimes careful timing and precision.\r\nIn terms of gameplay, Evoland 2 is a significant improvement over its predecessor. While the original Evoland was more of a proof-of-concept that showcased the evolution mechanic, Evoland 2 offers a more polished and cohesive gameplay experience especially in the narrative department. The game's evolution mechanic is also more pronounced and offers a greater sense of progression, with each evolution feeling like a significant milestone.\r\nAnother area where Evoland 2 improves upon the first game is in its length and content. The game offers a substantial amount of gameplay, with a story campaign that can take up to 15 hours to fully beat and keeps players engaged throughout the journey. The game also features multiple endings, depending on the choices the player makes throughout the game.\r\n2D to 3D and back again can be jarring\r\nSome minor gripes I had with the game is that its evolution mechanic can sometimes feel disorienting, especially when jumping from a heavily pixelated art-style into a clean and pristine 3D world. These segments sometimes may feel disjointed and unrelated to each other. Sort of giving you a “culture shock” feel whenever there is an evolution.\r\nTouch and Physical Controls\r\nAlso, the touchscreen controls are a bit difficult to use, especially with the ever changing control scheme, camera angles, and very rudimentary combat without much room for error.\r\nAs for alternative control options, Evoland 2 fully supports physical controllers, as I’ve tested it with a Razer Kishi controller and the game works flawlessly, even supporting UI navigation and hiding the on-screen touch controls.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5035369) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Last Shop - Craft & Trade is a store management game where players manage a town shop, selling weapons, armors, and supplies to adventurers in a survivalist town across an apocalyptic setting.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Borderline addictive merchant simulation\r\n- Bonus gameplay elements like town building and hero management## Cons\r\n-Gets grindy\r\n-Selling and restocking are done manually\r\nHave you ever wondered how it is like on the other side? On the side of the merchant selling goods to heroes and adventurers? The Last Shop - Craft & Trade will exactly let you experience being one. Build a store, receive raw materials, commission goods like weapons and armor to display at your shop. Heroes and adventurers will flock to your store looking for valuable goods to purchase, and it’s up to the player to sell and earn money.\r\nIf you have ever played games like Farmville, Cityville, or the more obscure old Facebook games like Market Street, The Last Shop is almost cut from the same cloth as them, the 2D cartoonish visuals, the gameplay setup, the real-time waiting, and microtransactions, all here.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay of The Last Shop - Craft & Trade banks heavily on the addictive nature of earning money, and so far it works so well. This is done by continually selling goods to adventurers in an ever increasing cycle of crafting increasingly better items, in turn selling for more and more money. Both landscape and portrait mode are properly supported.\r\nThe tutorial is a bit long-winded, It was a bit of an information overload, but it holds your hand and strictly guides you throughout much of the many systems in place. I started off by putting a bunch of display racks that can store items for sale. Then, I also set up a storage for my raw materials. After that, I just crafted my first few items to sell and they’re up there in the display and a customer came and asked for it immediately. The process is simple but it can get addicting quickly.\r\nYou interact with customers manually\r\nNow for the customers you can interact with them in many different ways, and it is generally tied to an energy system (this is not a play limiting currency), you can haggle with them, give them a discount, or redirect them to other items if the one they’re looking for is unavailable. There are also fellow merchants that will visit your store and offer many items to sell, if the price is right, a great way to skip crafting and have more items to sell.\r\nHero management and town building mechanics\r\nAside from managing a store, you can also hire heroes for yourself and order them to go on quests to the outside world for potential rewards. You can also view the city you’re in and sort of “invest” in the different infrastructures in there to get different boosts, such as an increased raw material production or a faster cooldown rate for your heroes.\r\nAs it turns out, the game is not strictly about managing a store, but rather it also includes managing heroes and building a town as well. It adds many minor flavors that makes the world feel more alive, among them also a Pet system that allows players to own a bunch, living in their store. You can also join guilds and invest with other players, but it’s not really a full system in place, but rather just another added flavor.\r\nAfter playing for a while, the duration of crafting for the different items that you can sell gets longer and longer, but the rewards are getting bigger and bigger. It inevitably gets grindy and protracted that will require you to check in once every few minutes, hours or days just so you can manually replenish your stock and manually attend to customers and sell. I wish there is an option to restock automatically, but I guess it is there to ever slightly encourage spending real money to speed this up.\r\nSince Last Shop - Craft & Trade is free-to-play, there are a lot of in-game purchases available. From simple premium currency top-ups, to increased drop rate for a whole year. Like the merchant game that it is, the whole game is littered with things to spend real money on.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5035009) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Additionally, the epic adventure story was a nice cherry on top that pleasantly surprised me and added another reason to play.  It is not directly related to the first game, so newcomers can try this one out without playing the first.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "Everspace 2 is an arcade spaceship action game developed and published by ROCKFISH Games. It is the sequel to the original Everspace game released in 2016. The game is available on PC, and modern consoles, and was released last April 6, 2023 after going on an Early Access phase for over a year.\r\nAs opposed to other space-sim games like Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous. Everspace 2 takes on a more casual and arcadey approach to the game while still giving an option for those sim-enthusiasts. The spaceship is easier to control overall and the combat favors style and flashiness over realism.\r\nThe game takes place in a vast, open-world space environment. Players take on the role of a clone pilot — the “same” pilot from the first game — who must explore different star systems, battle hostile forces, take on missions, and uncover the mysteries of the universe via a story campaign. The game's campaign is a mission based setup overlaid on an open world map, kind of similar to Grand Theft Auto, but in space. In addition, there are also side quests and missions that players can partake into. The game now abandons the rogue-lite nature of the first game, with the main character not being able to canonically die and respawn anymore as part of the story. He now only has one life.\r\nEverspace 2’s main source of enjoyment isn’t the spaceflight simulation, nor even the story, but the spaceship dogfights themselves, and they have been done quite well. It is an incredibly fun and immersive experience, especially when you play in first person cockpit mode. The visuals, from the lasers to the explosion are all solidly done — over the top fun — and the sound design packs a punch. It kind of felt like I was an X-Wing pilot fighting in Star Wars battles. The power fantasy experience of being a kick-ass space pilot is highly addictive, especially when playing in normal and lower difficulties.\r\nEverspace 2's graphics are absolutely gorgeous, with detailed spacecraft, colorful, vibrant explosions, and breathtakingly beautiful environments not only in space, but also with the different planet surfaces. Yes, you can land on planets but only in a limited manner and on selected regions only.  The game's sound design is equally impressive, with solid sound effects that create an immersive atmosphere.\r\nTo move the story, it features graphic novel-like panels to show character interactions and dialogue, while in-space sequences are powered by the in-game 3D graphics. The story overall is not the strongest point --- it being the combat instead --- but it's still a huge improvement over the first game and a decent experience nonetheless.\r\nI’ve only played a few hours and despite some steps backwards, I already love the overall direction Everspace 2 has taken so far. The graphics are better than ever, and the combat has been refined and made more fun. The narrative experience has also been improved, but at the expense of losing the rogue-lite nature of its predecessor.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5067219) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Rizline is a casual mobile rhythm game with anime-inspired music and a minimalist art style focused on simplistic lines and shapes.\r\n## Pros\r\n- minimalist art style with circles and lines\r\n- solid line-up of soothing and relaxing tracks to play\r\n- fun for casuals, challenging for hardcore players## Cons\r\n-Possible performance issues that might affect gameplay\r\nMinimalistic vertical lines that flow through the screen, lines that are swaying along with the music. and a two finger simple touch controls that anyone can follow — Rizline is a new rhythm game from Pigeon Games — the same makers of another popular rhythm game titled Phigros. I had the chance to try this game out and it's really a lot of fun and can cater both casual and hardcore rhythm enthusiasts.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay of Rizline involves tracking various lines with falling circles, and tapping the screen once it hits the bottom circle. The player's accuracy and timing are measured using a scoring system, which rewards players for hitting notes timely, correctly, and penalizes them for missing or hitting notes at the wrong time. Miss too many notes and the run will fail, but the progression is still recorded if it's a new high score.\r\nThere are only three types of circles dropping. A blue circle where it requires a tap, an elongated blue circle that signifies a timed hold, and a white circle that requires any type of hold. It’s a bit confusing at first — having two different types of “hold” mechanic — but I’ll admit it gets intuitive almost immediately once it clicks.\r\nMinimalist art, minimalist controls\r\nRizline’s rhythm game mechanics is easy to learn and only requires two fingers from each hand to use and tap the screen. The circles are only dropping one or two at a time, albeit in all sorts of challenging ways, and the players won’t have to use many fingers in a very convoluted screen mashing action even for higher difficulties. As for precision, players just need to tap the general direction of the corresponding bottom circle and not tap directly on it. Something that I erroneously tried to do in my first few song runs.\r\nThe gameplay experience is slightly customizable, as players can adjust the speed of the notes appearing on screen. It does not modify the song’s tempo, just the speed of the notes, whether they drop down almost instantly or appear early but slowly drop to the bottom. Players can also adjust the timing or delay of hitting notes, perfect for those who are using external or wireless audio solutions or just have personal issues as to how the timing works.\r\nConsistent difficulty levels\r\nThe lowest difficulty for the songs are easy enough and I keep finding myself perfecting them, however the hard and insane difficulty is another story that will require practice and great timing or reflexes to even complete. The number of notes are significantly increased, and the amount of swaying, wobbling, swapping, and additional distracting elements can prove to be too much for the casual player, and that’s where the hardcore players come in.\r\nTrying out many different songs, the difficulty has been more or less consistent with the easy, hard, and insane difficulties. The experience has been a mix of enjoyable and challenging. It’s an easy time-killer, you can easily play a short 2 minute song, play it again and again in the hopes of doing better, and without realizing it, an hour had already passed.\r\nA solid line-up of soothing and relaxing tracks to play\r\nOfcourse, a rhythm game is only going to be as good as its accompanying music, and Rizline delivers in that department as well with a solid line-up of tracks to play consisting a mix of soothing EDM music and a relaxing anime-esque soundtrack. It starts off with 3 amazingly crafted songs, with more to unlock and download (in-game) as you play.\r\nIn the version that I have tested, additional songs are very easy to unlock and only require gathering enough points from completed runs, and I was able to unlock a lot of songs even in my first few clears. I did not see any pay-to-win or in-app purchases for any additional songs, but I expect this to change once the game releases and the monetization model is finalized.\r\nPossible performance woes\r\nAs for the performance, in my admittedly limited testing, it did not perform to satisfaction in my older android (2018 flagship) device considering it only had simple shapes and lines for its visuals. Resulting in many unwarranted misses that is probably caused — If i were to guess —by microstutters and frame sampling issues. However, when I tested it on my newer android device (2020 flagship), it performed as expected and I was able to convincingly hit more accurately.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5069236) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It’s up to Nikola Tesla himself and his ragtag group of historical figures to stop this madness once and for all.\r\nPlayers can play as one of the four characters – Tesla, Lovecraft, Curie, and Shelley; and embark on a rogue-lite progression campaign with the characters using various electropunk-based weapons, abilities, and technologies to battle and kill monsters.\r\nThe gameplay in Tesla Force is fast-paced and challenging, requiring quick reflexes, precise aiming, and strategic thinking, resulting in a frantic fun experience where surviving is the ultimate goal. Players move around the screen using the left stick and aim their weapon with the right stick, either as a touch input or on a supported physical controller.\r\nEach time the player starts a new run, they begin at the first level with a basic loadout depending on their current permanent unlocks. As they progress through the run, they can collect new weapons and perks that modify their character, earn experience points, and unlock new abilities. Players can also pilot Mechas for a limited time upon spawning, and upon risking to collect all parts scattered around the map, will provide some massive boosts to damage and survivability.\r\nHowever, if the player dies, they lose all of their campaign progress and must start over from the beginning except for what they unlock permanently using energy and crystals. This system encourages players to experiment with different loadouts and strategies, making each playthrough feel unique, while still being able to slowly get powerful over time.\r\nMy experience with Tesla Force has been a mix of both casual arcade gameplay and a challenging rogue-lite ordeal. Its individual missions are fun to play and can sometimes be mindless, but will ultimately still need some player finesse to survive. While its rogue-lite progression is forgiving enough to restarting players while still providing a hardcore element by resetting the campaign upon death.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5069140) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Tesla Force is a rogue-lite survival twin stick shooter developed and published by 10tons Ltd, set in an alternate history, pervaded by lovecraftian horror themes. It is available for mobile platforms, Switch, PC, and modern consoles.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A casual arcade gameplay with a challenging rogue-lite experience\r\n- Procedurally generated campaign\r\n- A wide variety of weapons, power-ups, upgrades, and abilities.\r\n- Physical controller support## Cons\r\n-The mobile version has no multiplayer unlike the PC and Consoles\r\n-The graphics looks outdated\r\nTesla Force is set in a world where Nikola Tesla's inventions have started glitching and are opening portals around the world, spawning beings from another dimension that mostly resembles lovecraftian horror beings. It’s up to Nikola Tesla himself and his ragtag group of historic figures to stop this madness once and for all.\r\nThis game looks familiar\r\nThat would be right, because the game is both a spin-off and the spiritual successor to the 2018 game Tesla vs Lovecraft, bearing many similarities in both gameplay and mechanics. Improving the gameplay in many aspects and adding a persistent progression system built in a rogue-lite manner. The fun factor is still retained and just improved upon, with the game mechanics being made much deeper now.\r\nAt its core, Tesla Force is top-down shooter, with two options of either using a twin-stick setup or a single stick setup where aiming and movement direction are one and the same. There are three camera modes, one being a literal top-down shooter angle and the other two having a more isometric top-down view.\r\nPlayers can play as one of the four characters – Tesla, Lovecraft, Curie, and Shelley; and embark on a rogue-lite progression campaign with the characters using various electropunk-based weapons, abilities, and technologies to battle and kill monsters.\r\nThe game features a stylized art style that manages to create a lighthearted tone out of the otherwise horrifying lovecraftian elements. The graphics and visual effects aren’t the strongest point, looking like a game from the Xbox 360 era, but still a passable experience — especially on Mobile devices — due to its stylized art style.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay in Tesla Force is fast-paced and challenging, requiring quick reflexes, precise aiming, and strategic thinking, resulting in a frantic fun experience where surviving is the ultimate goal. Players move around the screen using the left stick and aim their weapon with the right stick, either as a touch input or on a supported physical controller.\r\nAs a twin-stick shooter, I find the default touch controls a bit unresponsive, thankfully can customize the position of the elements and resize them. I do highly recommend using physical controllers like the Razer Kishi, which is properly supported.\r\nWhile the PC and console versions feature multiplayer, I find this feature to be non-existent with the mobile version. A shame, as cooperative gameplay can be a lot of fun with twin-stick survival shooters.\r\nThe game features a wide variety of weapons and power-ups that can be collected, unlocked, and upgraded throughout the levels, each with their own gimmicks that players can tailor to their playstyle. The weapons range from simple pistols and shotguns to plasma and tesla coil weapons. The game's difficulty increases as the player progresses via a “doomsday timer\", with more enemies and obstacles thrown into the mix, keeping the gameplay frantically fresh and exciting.\r\nA challenging rogue-lite gameplay\r\nEach time the player starts a new run, they begin at the first level with a basic loadout depending on their current permanent unlocks. As they progress through the run, they can collect new weapons and perks that modify their character, earn experience points, and unlock new abilities. Players can also pilot Mechas for a limited time upon spawning, and upon risking to collect all parts scattered around the map, will provide some massive boosts to damage and survivability.\r\nThese aforementioned unlockable perks range from stat bonuses like health buffs or damage buffs, to more external buffs like a decreased teleport cooldown or a slower enemy movement speed. The different abilities are also looted in runs or unlocked permanently using crystals. Weapons power-ups can also be picked up that may add fire effects, increased fire rates, or even additional projectiles extremely amplifying the player’s damage temporarily.\r\nHowever, if the player dies, they lose all of their campaign progress and must start over from the beginning except for what they unlock permanently using energy and crystals. This system encourages players to experiment with different loadouts and strategies, making each playthrough feel unique, while still being able to slowly get powerful over time.\r\nProcedural generation\r\nAs for the procedurally generated rogue-lite campaign, players are given a limited selection of missions to take part in run after run, and consist mostly of having to complete varied types of objectives while surviving the onslaught of monsters. Some missions will have you collect parts to repair a contraption, some might need your pure endurance to survive while waiting for an analysis to complete. Complete these objectives and the mission is now completed and extraction is now unlocked. After a series of missions, it will culminate in a boss fight that will end the chapter once defeated\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5078866) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players take on the role of a clone pilot — the “same” pilot from the first game — who must explore different star systems, battle hostile forces, take on missions, and uncover the mysteries of the universe via story campaign.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A good middle ground between arcade and simulation\r\n- An incredibly fun and immersive space combat experience\r\n- Gorgeous graphics\r\n- Support for various third-party peripherals\r\n- Improved narrative over the first game\r\n## Cons\r\n- a step back in some respects - losing rogue-lite elements and VR from the first game\r\nEverspace 2 is a space combat arcade game developed and published by ROCKFISH Games. It is the sequel to the original Everspace game released in 2016. The game is available on PC, and modern consoles, and was released last April 6, 2023 after going on an Early Access phase for over a year.\r\n## How does it connect to Everspace 1? Is it standalone?\r\nFor newcomers – Everspace 2 is kind of a standalone game, and it is even more evident with how the gameplay has evolved. The story is loosely connected with each other, and the sequel abandons the rogue-lite and procedurally generated setup of the first game — which is a shame for rogue-lite fans — but makes it up with a better narrative experience and overall better ride from start to finish.\r\n## A good middle ground between arcade and simulation\r\nAs opposed to other space-sim games like Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous. Everspace 2 takes on a more casual and arcadey approach to the game while still giving an option for those sim-enthusiasts. The spaceship is easier to control overall and the combat favors style and flashiness over realism.\r\nWhile it is primarily an arcade style game, players can still have great control over their movement, including six degrees of freedom (pitch, yaw, roll, plus thrust in all 3 vectors) but you don’t have to be an expert pilot to maneuver with all the accessibility options in place. The controls are easy and anyone who is familiar with gaming on a controller or keyboard and mouse can pick it up and play.\r\n## Third Party peripheral support\r\nThird party flight controllers are also supported and mine works flawlessly and seamlessly even in combination with keyboard, or controllers. I was able to bind all controls without issues. As for camera options, everything is here: first or third person, either with cockpit or with different levels of zoom. Bad news though for VR players of the first game, as this one does not include VR, nor the developers have any plans to include it in the future.\r\n## Gameplay Analysis\r\nThe game's campaign is a mission based setup overlaid on an open world map, kind of similar to Grand Theft Auto, but in space. In addition, there are also side quests and missions that players can partake into. Since the game now abandons the rogue-lite nature, the main character cannot canonically die and respawn anymore as part of the story. He now only has one life.\r\nEverspace 2's open ”space” structure means that players can explore at their volition. They can take on various missions – some randomized, such as completing deliveries or engaging in dogfights with enemy spacecraft. The game's side missions and objectives are engaging and offer an additional chance to earn experience points and resources.\r\n## An incredibly fun and immersive space combat experience\r\nEverspace 2’s main source of enjoyment isn’t the spaceflight simulation, nor even the story, but the spaceship dogfights themselves, and they have been done quite well. It is an incredibly fun and immersive experience, especially when you play in first person cockpit mode. The visual effects, from the lasers to the explosion are all solidly done — over the top fun — and the sound design packs a punch. It kind of felt like I was an X-Wing pilot fighting in Star Wars battles. The power fantasy experience of being a kick-ass space pilot is highly addictive, especially when playing in normal and lower difficulties.\r\nMechanically, the space combat in Everspace 2 is a combination of long-range and close combat engagements. Players have access to various weapons, including laser beams, missiles, and plasma guns, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The game's targeting system allows players to lock onto enemy ships and track their movements, making it easier to land accurate shots.\r\n## Crafting and Progression\r\nA second main core gameplay feature of Everspace is the crafting system. Players can salvage resources from destroyed enemy ships and use them to create new weapons, equipment, and upgrades for their spacecraft, players must choose which resources to collect and how to use them effectively. This blends very well with the dogfighting aspect of Everspace 2, and provides the majority of the fun factor. The side missions, and even the main missions can get tedious or boring at times, only to be saved by a subsequent amazing dogfight sequence.\r\n## Beautiful cosmic visuals\r\nEverspace 2's graphics are absolutely gorgeous, with detailed spacecraft, colorful, vibrant explosions, and breathtakingly beautiful environments not only in space, but also with the different planet surfaces. Yes, you can land on planets but only in a limited manner and on selected regions only.  The game's sound design is equally impressive, with solid sound effects that create an immersive atmosphere.\r\nTo move the story, it features graphic novel-like panels to show character interactions and dialogue, while in-space sequences are powered by the in-game 3D graphics. The story overall is not the strongest point --- it being the combat instead --- but it's still a huge improvement over the first game and a decent experience nonetheless that players can expect to beat in around 30 or more hours.\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nEverspace 2 is a fun and focused interstellar adventure that will have players blasting through the vast reaches of space, fending off enemies, and uncovering the mysteries of the galaxy. The best highlight of this game is the space combat, and one that it does very well and is one of the best in the genre. The missions and the story can sometimes get in the way of doing more dogfights and there may have been slight steps backwards with regards to the first game, but overall, it is a great game that is a must-play for all space combat arcade fans out there.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5078720) Originally posted on TapTap.",

More specifically, a memory bank that houses hundreds of “cycles” of history and thousands of citizens. Something big has happened here, and our player character has been called by someone from here to investigate.\r\nBeautiful story and art style\r\nImmediately from the start, I was hooked by the amazing storytelling and beautiful 2D visual novel art-style with 3D parallax and neon-light effects. There is no voice acting, and the game is purely read by the player — which is even more impressive that I got compelled by that much.  Since the game is heavy on reading, I find it convenient that the game offers UI text scaling, and I immediately ramped it up to high so my deteriorating eyes can see it better. The game also supports controllers on PCs so that’s a big plus.\r\nUpon approaching the repository, we are welcomed by Grish, an enforcer of the building and right from the get go, the game asks for our choices on how to react with the first character that we meet. The game will clearly state any paths that you will take and whenever it affects a sequence that will happen down the line, making the branches well structured and easily understood by the player.\r\nCaptures what it’s like to be participating in an interactive novel\r\nThe storytelling method is akin to reading a novel or a book. With honest to goodness expressive narration that helps sell the scene to the players, dialogues that are well written, giving characters personality and making the plot highly interesting. Everything is narrated, the background scenery, the character’s reactions and gestures, even their demeanor is properly communicated to the player. In fact, if there was voice acting, you can probably play this with your eyes closed. The narration and dialogue is that well crafted.\r\nStorytelling accessibility options\r\nPlayers can manually skip the dialogue, as well as view the chat log for some things you might have accidentally missed as well as a Codex option to learn more about the world’s lore, which is a pretty nice accessibility option. Players can also let the dialogue auto-play for a hands free experience — that is until there is a choice to be made.\r\nEvery now and then, a choice will be presented to the player and these choices will matter. Characters can become friends or allies, die or not, help you or not. Making the experience highly immersive and interactive. And speaking of interactiveness, Tron: Identity features a unique and singular puzzle mechanic that is used throughout the story, and as well as the separate dedicated game mode for playing it exclusively.\r\nThere is only one type of puzzle in the game\r\nThe only puzzle element of Tron: Identity comprises the disc-defragging Puzzle element that is performed to unlock the memories of other characters, who are somehow suffering from memory loss for an unknown reason. Players will need to reduce the number of cards by pairing them with the same shapes or numbers to eliminate them, while constantly circumventing the many erratic cards that will pose an additional challenge. For those who want to truly focus on the narrative, or are having difficulty with a specific puzzle, they may opt to skip these puzzles at no cost. Another win as far as accessibility goes.\r\nUltimately, this puzzling element throughout the main story only serves as a tutorial of sorts to the entirely separate game mode which focuses on endlessly solving puzzles, where the game shifts the focus on being a narrative adventure game into a pure puzzle one.\r\nSurprising game length\r\nTo my surprise, after playing for just TWO hours, Tron: Identity ended abruptly. The choices I made have indeed mattered, but not in the scale or magnitude that I had hoped, nor in the resolution that I expected for a game that is ending. In the aforementioned Codex, there are indeed branches for the different characters that you can take. Encouraging you to play more to know more, so the two hour playtime isn’t the end-all, but for a single playthrough, two hours is a bit too short, especially for the asking price of $15.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5100550) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game maintains the same GBA 3:2 ratio aspect ratio and instead inserts Mega Man backgrounds for the remaining screen space, with no option for black bars.\r\nThe Mega Man Battle Network games, or Battle Network for short, takes place in a distant future where the digital world has taken over people’s daily lives. Players take on the role of the fifth-grader Lan Hikari, a young boy who is the operator of an online Avatar called MegaMan.EXE.\r\nThe gameplay of Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection features two main components. The part where players control Lan Hikari and roam around the real world, and the dungeon crawling part where players control his avatar, MegaMan.EXE instead and roam inside the digital world full of viruses and other avatars. While the RPG-esque gameplay of Pokemon is somewhat resembled here, it turns itself into a whole new unique experience by incorporating hacker culture and The Matrix influences— themes that have just recently reached heights in the early 2000s as well.\r\nThe combat of Battle Network is the most unique aspect of this game series, which involves players controlling MegaMan.EXE in random combat encounters with the battles taking place in a 6x3 grid. Players move MegaMan around the tiles in real-time to dodge enemy attacks and launch their own attacks. This whole dynamic is pretty basic at first glance, but the addition of so-called “battle chips” into the equation made all the difference.\r\nYou’d think the format is fully real-time here, but it's actually turn-based in the grand scheme of things. Before the battles start, players must strategize which battle chips to bring in (from a randomized pool) which will represent the different abilities and moves available for real-time use, aside from the basic attack. After a while, you are allowed to bring in new chips for use again, forming the “turns” of the combat system. This basically comprises the deck building aspect of the game.\r\nI found the rules for selecting the chips are mainly restrictive at first, because you can only bring in either duplicate chips or chips with the same code (which rarely happens more than 2 times), but after some time, it actually adds a lot of depth to the deck building element, making players think about different synergies and potential combinations with the chip codes. Resulting in some amazing combination of chips to use, despite the randomized nature.\r\nThis change in style actually shocked me, as while I have known and played Mega Man games since I was a child, I have only played the mainline games so far and these were action-packed side-scrolling platformers, far from the turn-based, deck building, Pokemon-ized gameplay of Battle Network. Despite this, I’m actually having a blast playing this almost 20 year old game series. For both Mega Man fans and non-fans alike who have yet to try this and are open to fresh retro gameplay opportunities, this is probably the perfect chance to try this game, if you can stomach the full AAA price of $60.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5126697) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "This is it. Another trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has finally dropped, one month before the release date, and I am very, very excited from what I've seen so far.\r\nThe new trailer is just short of 4 minutes, but it packs a lot, full of brand new footage that will surely leave fans excited and eagerly anticipating the release of the upcoming game.\r\nIt is looking like Tears of the Kingdom will include a lot of much needed verticality in its gameplay, as one of the main focuses of the trailer is seemingly the floating islands that suddenly popped out of nowhere above Hyrule, brought forth by the awakening of Ganondorf and the ensuring war that broke out.\r\nThe new added verticality will probably allow players to travel back and forth between sky and land: from what we've in the trailer, via Battle Royale-esque free falling and paragliding, as well as going back up via a rocket ships or some kind of magic sky elevators.\r\nNot only we are going to explore the sky above, but also a network of caverns deep underground, including lava-filled regions (probably under Death Mountain). It's looks as equally as interesting as the sky exploration aspect. The aesthetic for the caverns are predominantly red/orange and brownish and will probably house much of the more dangerous enemies in the game,  and we've also seen exploration and combat involving good 'ol mining carts .\r\nMuch of the Hyrule landscape that we know and love have been mostly retained, so the setting has moved on to much more lower and higher altitudes. However, that's not to say nothing as changed on the surface: new or evolved settlements, camps, and strongholds are now present, as well as new mysterious structures and towers.\r\nAside from the evolved landscape and new areas to explore, the combat of the game seems to be have been improved further, we have another footage of the new feature \"Recall\" mechanic here -- stopping thrown projectiles and throwing them back at enemies, as well as parrying enemies with a shield fused to a sword.\r\nThe trailer also showed some of the potential bosses that players are going to be soon encountering. Including the return of Gleeok, a three headed dragon. We've also seen many new exciting platforming and puzzle sections -- again including verticality in the equation -- Platforming and puzzle sections in the sky above, navigating through Mission Impossible style laser obstacles, and paragliding in narrow passageways.\r\nSo far, everything looks amazing. While the graphics are mostly the same --- understandably because of the aging hardware of the Nintendo Switch --- it at least looks visually as breathtaking as its predecessor, Breath of the Wild. Another Game of the Year for Nintendo this 2023? It's highly possible.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5123584) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With three games comprising each forming two Volumes.\r\nSet in an alternate universe\r\nThe Mega Man Battle Network games, or Battle Network for short, takes place in a distant future where the digital world has taken over people’s daily lives. Players take on the role of the fifth-grader Lan Hikari, a young boy who is the operator of an online Avatar called MegaMan.EXE.\r\nThese online avatars called NetNavi are effectively AI assistants that also function as avatars for their human operators, doing various tasks, including acting as anti-virus measures. In this case, Lan Hikari's avatar is MegaMan.EXE. Together, they will battle and delete viruses and other NetNavis that threaten the Internet.\r\nPokemon inspirations\r\nAside from being a game primarily designed for handheld at the time, the game could essentially be described as a “Pokemon-ized” version of the Mega Man franchise and features a gameplay that is much more closer to the Pokemon than being an actual side-scrolling action game like the mainline Mega Man games. However, the gameplay of Pokemon and Battle Network are still so different that it would be a huge disservice to Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection if I just leave it at that description.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay of Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection features two main components. The part where players control Lan Hikari and roam around the real world, and the dungeon crawling part where players control his avatar, MegaMan.EXE instead and roam inside the digital world full of viruses and other avatars. While the RPG-esque gameplay of Pokemon is somewhat resembled here, it turns itself into a whole new unique experience by incorporating hacker culture and The Matrix influences— themes that have just recently reached heights in the early 2000s as well.\r\nInternet of things\r\nSince almost every aspect in this distant future is connected and powered by computers and the internet, almost every electronic device in the real world is accessible by MegaMan.EXE too, including appliances and trivial things, and they do have their own digital space that is in essence another dungeon to crawl into.\r\nThe story of the six games all follow Lan Hikari and his avatar MegaMan.EXE, against varying cyberthreats, both new and recurring, and has remained mostly consistent in tone and writing. Everything boils down to stopping a powerful cyberthreat from enacting their evil goals, while continuously providing lore, history, and increasingly evolving gameplay mechanics for each iteration.\r\nAs with the nature of the digital world, the more advanced the technology, the same goes with the dangers that come into play. As such, to aid these NetNavi avatars in their anti-virus work, “battle chips” have been invented as a means to protect avatars and to allow them to inflict a lot of damage.\r\nUnconventional combat mechanics\r\nThe combat of Battle Network is the most unique aspect of this game series, which involves players controlling MegaMan.EXE in random combat encounters with the battles taking place in a 6x3 grid. Players move MegaMan around the tiles in real-time to dodge enemy attacks and launch their own attacks. This whole dynamic is pretty basic at first glance, but the addition of so-called “battle chips” into the equation made all the difference.\r\nYou’d think the format is fully real-time here, but it's actually turn-based in the grand scheme of things. Before the battles start, players must strategize which battle chips to bring in (from a randomized pool) which will represent the different abilities and moves available for real-time use, aside from the basic attack. After a while, you are allowed to bring in new chips for use again, forming the “turns” of the combat system. This basically comprises the deck building aspect of the game.\r\nDeck building before it was cool\r\nThere are different types of chips, and taken randomly from the player’s entire pool. From that random selection, players will have to select the actual chips they bring in, with some strict rules — either they are all the same, or they contain the same code. These chips mostly constitute the main damage dealers in combat.\r\nThe basic attack works, but its not meant as a main damage dealer and you’ll find its damage very underwhelming to use in most encounters — unless you turn on the Buster max mode, which is a cheat setting that makes the damage an instant kill for all enemies.\r\nI found the rules for selecting the chips are mainly restrictive at first, because you can only bring in either duplicate chips or chips with the same code (which rarely happens more than 2 times), but after some time, it actually adds a lot of depth to the deck building element, making players think about different synergies and potential combinations with the chip codes. Resulting in some amazing combination of chips to use, despite the randomized nature.\r\nThis change in style actually shocked me, as while I have known and played Mega Man games since I was a child, I have only played the mainline games so far and these were action-packed side-scrolling platformers, far from the turn-based, deck building, Pokemon-ized gameplay of Battle Network. Despite this, I’m actually having a blast playing this almost 20 year old game series.\r\nA consistent, but still evolving experience\r\nAll six games follow this gameplay format, with some slight changes to the formula per iteration but never really revolutionizing anything. For example, Battle Network 2 adds the ability to change Mega Man’s style — meaning his weaponry and elemental affinity, another example is Battle Network 6’s BeastOut ability allowing Mega Man to turn into a more powerful beast form ala-Power Rangers. The biggest change so far in the series was Battle Network 4’s  change in artstyle.\r\nAdditional \"remastered\" features\r\nAnd as if over a hundred hours of content isn’t enough, the game also adds a multiplayer PVP mode focusing on the unique deck building and 6x3 grid combat, with a ranked game mode and battle chip trading to boot, a nice cherry on top with a viewable gallery and music player commemorating all the content they’ve done throughout the series.\r\nPlayers can also activate a high-resolution filter to eliminate the retro blockiness, but in my opinion just makes the game look ugly and worse than the native retro graphics. The game maintains the same GBA 3:2 ratio aspect ratio and instead inserts Mega Man backgrounds for the remaining screen space, with no option for black bars.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5144497) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "CaseCracker is an investigative crime-deduction game where players are put in a highly immersive experience of solving crimes via an experimental test system. It is currently available for PC and mobile devices.\r\nCaseCracker’s test system functions similarly to an operating system where you are free to read about the details of the crime, follow any leads or clues, search databases, and perform actions such as DNA tests and warranted searches to eventually uncover the perpetrator.\r\nThis setup is highly reminiscent of the game series Orwell where you are also put as an operation of an operating system to solve crimes. The only difference is that, CaseCracker doesn’t hold your hands at the slightest bit and is truly leaving deduction at the hands of the players. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? It depends, it can either compel you to play and channel your inner detective, or get you frustrated due to investigative dead ends and mental blocks.\r\nCaseCracker opens up with our very first case, a very gruesome murder and discovery of an unidentified body. The description is highly morbid and doesn’t really hold back, so a bit of caution there for those looking for a lighthearted detective experience. Immediately I was put to the test, religiously reading out the first few bits of initial information I was given in the hopes of landing one clue after the other.\r\nHow you discover clues involves just typing out the words in the search box, hoping that something comes up. See a name mentioned? Try to type that in. See a mentioned related incident that happened long ago? Try to search that too, and maybe take note of the date. The resulting experience is highly immersive, perhaps a little bit too much that it may become frustrating… but detectives do get frustrated all the time too? So it’s not really a bad thing here.\r\nHowever, this system isn’t exactly perfect. The text search isn’t exactly forgiving and requires an exact phrase (down to the plural) in order to be recognized and it adds a lot to the frustration. The small UI isn’t exactly well designed for touchscreen use especially with all the landscape typing it requires. As far as the system and storytelling, it soon shows its glaring weaknesses as well.\r\nWhile CaseCracker also boasts an intertwined story between the characters involved: suspects, witnesses, and the victim. And it is true, the characters are affecting each other. But perhaps, they are a bit too intertwined to the point that its immersion is breaking and unbelievable. Cases will fully revolve around a small selection of characters only and it feels like they’re the only citizens living in the city. A bestfriend that happens to be the victim's wife that happens to have history with the killer 10 years ago, who also delivered pizza to the suspect’s brother a few weeks ago (not an actual in-game example)…. That’s literally how CaseCracker navigates around its characters\r\nIt is also in dire need of \"filler\" content and red herring to be able to effectively turn this into an intriguing investigation, instead of just blindly following any clue because any clue you found is going to have some use. You’ll often find yourself looking at other potential leads, typing something only to find no recognition because it isn’t the way the developers intended it to happen.\r\nUsing a vague example, a witness specifically claims that a suspect owns an object of interest, and mentions being friends with a group of people. Naturally, you would want to follow both leads, this object and this group of people. However, only the object can become a clue, while this mentioned group of people is totally ignored and cannot be followed. Making it feel very scripted to me.\r\nCase in point, CaseCracker pushes the limits of video game storytelling and crime-deduction elements, that it can result in a polarizing outcome of either being highly immersive, or downright frustrating. It is now currently available on android as a Taptap exclusive, or you can get it on Steam for PC.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5153604) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The award-winning game Vampire Survivors has recently released its second DLC, titled 'Tides of the Foscari.' This DLC is available for $1.99 on all platforms, including Android and iOS devices. It adds a ton of content to the already amazing value of the original game, which is completely free-to-play.\r\nFor those unfamiliar with Vampire Survivors, it is a highly addicting rogue-lite RPG survival game playable with only one hand, with the players only needing to control the character's movements. Attacks are automated and the whole gameplay focuses on character and skill building and surviving the countless waves of monsters.\r\nThe new DLC “Tides of the Foscari” adds 8 new characters, 13 new weapons, 1 passive item, and a brand new map to play in. The featured new map, called Lake Foscari, features an enchanted forest and neighboring village, swamplands, mushroom and flora-based enemies, and mazes for players to get lost in. Being a forest, the place is filled with trees that can block the view for players and can pose obstacles as well. There’s also a bit of challenge when it comes to navigating the highly restrictive village fences and the mazes, when enemies are coming from all directions.\r\nThe new DLC doesn’t outright unlock all these goodies instantly, requiring players to work for almost every single new addition. The only thing unlocked from the start is the new map Lake Foscari. Everything else is unlocked via a multi-part process that is best left to the players to unravel — Let’s just say it involves finding certain points of interests on the map,  leveling up certain weapons and characters, or surviving for over a specific amount of time.\r\nThink of it like doing a ritual with all the different ingredients you need to gather to perform, Tides of the Foscari offers players a new recipe, instead of giving players a finished dish. This way, players are not just outright buying the new content, but instead purchasing a fresh new experience of playing the game on the way to unlocking the various characters and weapons added.\r\nI haven’t unlocked every single character and weapon yet — that will take time, multiple runs, and a bit of luck — but so far the added weapons (some of them are just evolved versions of other new weapons) are all exciting and fun to use, and they are relatively well balanced compared to the original roster of weapons, with their own unique mechanics and gimmicks.\r\nThey don’t cannibalize the purpose of any existing weapons and are a good fit to the overall selection. The characters on the other hand are directly tied to the lore of the Foscari, and are also directly related to the new weapons, although players can also unlock the weapons for use by other characters.\r\nTo sum it up, Tides of the Foscari adds an amazing value proposition to the already highly addictive game in Vampire Survivors. It doesn’t just introduce new content but rather an entirely new experience for players to unravel and enjoy. At only $2, it's an incredible value, almost as good as the original game, which is unbeatable being free-to-play at least on mobile platforms.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5160686) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Demian Saga is a pirate-themed gacha game with charming visuals and filled with lots of  waifu characters to collect.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A refreshing narrative take\r\n- Pleasing visuals and character design (waifu)\r\n- A variety of activities to participate in## Cons\r\n-Highly limiting time currency\r\n-A bit grindy even early on\r\nDemian Saga is a brand new pirate-themed gacha game featuring real-time idle combat, RPG mechanics, and hot waifu characters to collect. Players control Aisha and his band of pirates in a swashbuckling odyssey of epic proportions. The story is actually interesting here and I love the fresh narrative take on the genre with the pirate-themed story.\r\nA refreshing narrative take\r\nThe opening cinematic sets the tone for both the atmosphere and gameplay of the game, showcasing the amazing art style featuring the chibi-looking characters, pleasing visuals, and action packed gameplay. The pirate adventure story is told in small bits at a time, via Visual Novel-style dialogues (The characters are now non-chibi here), and has one of the more interesting stories I have played so far on recent gacha games.\r\nThe basic premise is basically about the state of the world after an event called the “Fractured Night”, where five nations across space and time were suddenly transported — as a whole — on one single world, as well as bringing monstrous beings called Kaos to this new world. These five nations of Everwood, Poseia, Gigantria, Elysion, and Akeroth couldn’t be more different with each other in terms of culture, technology, and magical abilities.\r\nSoon after, tons of artifacts called ooparts (out of place artifacts) have suddenly started to appear as well, bringing forth a new age of piracy that still continues up to the present day. The most coveted artifact of all — the legendary “Demian” — is rumored to be in the Primeval Highlands, a dangerous place filled with Kaos, and this is where the story starts, where I was immediately placed in Aisha’s shoes at the advent of her journey, just having recruited his first crew member.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay of Demian Saga mainly centers on advancing through the story chapters little by little, using the various heroes at your disposal, collecting and managing them throughout the entirety of the experience. These waifu heroes are mostly obtained through a gacha system — with varying levels of rarity — and they are upgradable as well. Nothing we haven’t seen before, and these mechanics are mostly standard issue as far as the genre goes.\r\nNothing we haven’t seen before\r\nDemian Saga features run-of-the-mill free-to-play live service elements: daily challenges, quests, login bonuses, and various in-game currency sinks all with the ultimate goal of leveling up the characters or getting better ones. The gacha system is kind of standard, spending diamonds and tickets to draw heroes, including a pity rate designed to guarantee a quality drop after 30 tries.\r\nEvery chapter is composed of 10 missions including a mid and final boss fight. The missions themselves are just 1-2 minute battles with the occasional story bits and dialogues. Progressing the story is a lot of fun, however even in the first few hours, I was already severely limited by the time currency system which limited my gameplay to around an hour per mission, encouraging players to spend money to progress faster. Although there is a login bonus though that temporarily boosted my time currency and allowed me to play a bit in my initial playthrough.\r\nThe battles are played out automatically, requiring no player input, except for optionally opting to manually activate skills and increasing the speed of the battles even more. Even though the game might seem boring without much player engagement, the presentation is visually appealing to the eyes, with the chibi characters battling them out in real time and spewing tons of special effects and abilities resulting in an action-packed display.\r\nEvery hero has their own special abilities that can be activated after a cooldown, and some of them can be manually targeted by the player. The main character’s initial ability can inflict heavy damage and put enemies in statis, for example. And more abilities will unlock later on after leveling up the heroes.\r\nA variety of activities to participate in\r\nOutside the main campaign, there are also tons of other side activities that the players can do — free of charge — without exhausting the time currency. From the endless “Tower of Chaos” mechanic with increasingly difficult enemies and offers endless rewards, to the more rogue-lite game mode “Treasure Maps” element where you can collect map fragments to enter new areas to conquer. More game modes will unlock as you play, adding a lot of variety to the otherwise simplistic battle system.\r\nEven in my initial few hours of Demian Saga, I can already feel that the game feels grindy, with the enemy strength spiking relatively quickly even in the first few missions. With the amount of resources needed to level up the characters, it’s definitely going to take time to progress in this game, even if you let it play by itself in idle mode. Since it is a free-to-play game though, there are convenient in-game purchases to help players get by, that is if they’re willing to spend money.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5158604) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It’s not the OG Minecraft gameplay we know and love, but it is STILL distinctively Minecraft in both the looks and the tone.\r\nPiglins from the Nether have invaded the world, and are trying to spread corruption across the land. The mobs have banded together and contacted the player controlled hero, to carry the banner and lead the mobs — friendly and hostile alike — in driving out the forces of Piglins.\r\nThe gameplay mostly centers on controlling your hero on a mount, gathering resources, and building structures to summon new units and defend the land. You have to liberate and defend villages across the open-world map, and try to clamp down the enemy foothold one base, at a time. There is an optional cooperative multiplayer to invite your friends to your campaign, and versus multiplayer, where the format mostly follows the general strategy element of the game.\r\nStarting the game I was immediately introduced to the resource gathering system where I commanded the Alloys mobs to gather Stones and Wood. Then I was able to build out structures called spawners to summon my first few golems mobs that followed me — mostly divided into two categories: Melee and Ranged. Since the Piglins that have invaded the land are terrorizing a nearby village, I was sent out to defend them.\r\nIn between building and combat consists of traveling around the gorgeous looking open world map with different biomes from grasslands, swamplands, to even ice cold snowy regions, filled with familiar mobs Minecraft players will instantly recognize. The design of the world feels very much like a Minecraft one, never really deviating from the established aesthetic. The hero’s mount is swappable, and there are quite a few of them available in the game. Some can fly and some can crawl up walls.\r\nThe combat is simplistic in nature, the character only has one attack move, so the focus of the gameplay is more gravitated towards tactical decision-making and leading your units as opposed to actual moment to moment combat. Different units are more suited to different tasks like absorbing damage, taking down buildings, or killing enemies, and it's up to the player, or players in cooperative mode, to utilize them.\r\nWhen defending villages, the game feels a lot like a tower defense game, where you are free to build out defensive structures, as well as walls to hold off waves of enemy attacks. When attacking, the game will feel like sieges in games most similar to Mount and Blade, where you need to force yourself into enemy strongholds and destroy key structures.\r\nI haven't had much experience with the game's multiplayer aspect yet, so my experience is mostly from the first few hours of singleplayer gameplay. Having said that, Minecraft Legends appears to be enjoyable for fans of action-strategy and Minecraft, who will find themselves at home with its lighthearted tone, and refreshed with its new gameplay direction.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5183518) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Minecraft Legends\r\nGameplay\r\nMinecraft Legends is an action strategy game set in the Minecraft universe of video games. Released for Windows, Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Refreshing new take with its action strategy gameplay\r\n- Keeps the Minecraft feel and tone intact\r\n- Cooperative gameplay mode for the whole campaign## Cons\r\n-Main campaign is very short\r\n-Asking price is a bit high\r\n-Versus multiplayer needs a lot of work\r\nMinecraft with another spin-off\r\nAn addition to the growing roster of Minecraft spin-offs like the Diablo-esque Minecraft Dungeons and the narratively focused Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Legends is a refreshing new take on the Minecraft brand with its shift into a third person action-strategy gameplay. It’s not the OG Minecraft gameplay we know and love, but it is STILL distinctively Minecraft in both the looks and the tone.\r\nPiglins from the Nether have invaded the world, and are trying to spread corruption across the land. The mobs have banded together and contacted the player controller hero, to carry the banner and lead the mobs — friendly and hostile alike — in driving out the forces of Piglins.\r\nKeeps the Minecraft feel and tone intact\r\nThe story is a typical good vs evil conflict but in a lighthearted, classic Minecraft aesthetic. The stakes are high and the overall tone of the story sinister, but the game never fails to make fun of the situation with the silly animations and interactions between the characters. It’s obviously primarily made for kids, but that’s not to say it isn’t for everyone.\r\nIn traditional Minecraft fashion, resource gathering and building are still an important part of gameplay, albeit in a more strategy game fashion where you now just build full structures instead of individual blocks. Gathering resources are still present, but is now a charming musical command for your Allays mobs to do. For those used to Minecraft’s first person building experience, this is an entirely fresh new experience that more resembles Fortnite style of building.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nThe gameplay mostly centers on controlling your hero on a mount, gathering resources, and building structures to summon new units and defend the land. You have to liberate and defend villages across the open-world map, and try to clamp down the enemy foothold one base, at a time. There is an optional cooperative multiplayer to invite your friends to your campaign, and versus multiplayer, where the format mostly follows the general strategy element of the game.\r\nIt is indeed a real time strategy game; where you build structures, units, and commend them, an action one since you can control your hero and participate in battle yourself. The gameplay is mostly reminiscent of Pikmin from Nintendo, or for more Medieval game oriented players, the game Mount and Blade.\r\nStarting the game I was immediately introduced to the resource gathering system where I commanded the Alloys Mobs to gather Stones and Wood. Then I was able to build out structures called spawners to summon my first few golems that followed me — mostly divided into two categories: Melee and Ranged. Since the Piglins that have invaded the land are terrorizing a nearby village, I was sent out to defend them.\r\nThat’s basically the whole gameplay cycle of Minecraft Legends, defend and liberate villages, take out enemy bases and outposts to reclaim the land. In between building and combat consists of traveling around the gorgeous looking open world map with different biomes from grasslands, swamplands, to even ice cold snowy regions, filled with familiar mobs Minecraft players will instantly recognize.\r\nThe design of the world feels very much like a Minecraft one, never really deviating from the established aesthetic. The hero’s mount is swappable, and there are quite a few of them available in the game. Some can fly and some can crawl up walls.\r\nAs you play the game, you will be able to unlock new types of resources, and in turn new types of units to use, so there’s an added RTS building element, but drawn out and stretched throughout the entirety of the story campaign. In addition, your ability to rally and control mobs will be upgraded, increasing their capacity to support an increasingly bigger army.\r\nThe combat is simplistic in nature, the character only has one attack move, so the focus of the gameplay is more gravitated towards tactical decision-making and leading your units as opposed to actual moment to moment combat. Different units are more suited to different tasks like absorbing damage, taking down buildings, or killing enemies, and it's up to the player, or players in cooperative mode, to utilize them.\r\nWhen defending villages, the game feels a lot like a tower defense game, where you are free to build out defensive structures, as well as walls to hold off waves of enemy attacks. When attacking, the game will feel like sieges in games most similar to Mount and Blade, where you need to force yourself into enemy strongholds and destroy key structures.\r\nThe basic controls are highly intuitive and even when using controllers on PC, they are well designed — Easy and straightforward enough to be picked up and played by anyone who has played modern third person action titles. However, control issues arise when using the more advanced banner view to command individual units and group types. It’s masquerading as a complex control system when in fact it's more chaotic and confusing to use.\r\nSpeaking of gripes, the versus multiplayer mode still needs a lot of work. There is no way to do matchmaking with friends, so there is no concrete way to play with friends this way. However, the co-op works fine and ultimately is an extremely superior experience over playing this game in singleplayer.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5193340) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It is highly reminiscent of the premise of the Netflix film Bright.\r\nCoffee Talk's title couldn't be more fitting for the game. As you combine various ingredients and serve drinks, you also listen to their stories and help them with their problems, all while enjoying the game's relaxing soundtrack and charming pixel graphics.\r\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly continues the same gameplay setup of the first game, while introducing new ingredients and minor gameplay elements, like a lost and found drawer and the ability to give items to customers along with their ordered beverage. They’re simple additions but add a lot to the immersion to being a Coffee shop owner.\r\nThe gameplay of the game is simple and in some ways repetitive, but highly mesmerizing that you’d want to do it again and again. Your main task is to prepare and serve the drinks that your customers order by selecting the right ingredients based on their requests, or descriptions. Some can be straightforward, some are more vague, some will even allow you to experiment. Learned recipes are saved to your phone and can be viewed for reference at all times.\r\nThe drinks range from classics like Black Coffee and Lattes to more uniquely named and unfamiliar beverages like Masala Chai and Spanish Sahara. For Lattes and Milk based drinks, you can even make latte art to serve to customers. The system to make the coffee art is tricky but ultimately fun to use, and I have spent lots of time trying to make such art. Fortunately, it is not timed and resets are completely consequence-free.\r\nAs for the actual orders, there are no severe consequences for serving the wrong drinks — you’ll only mostly get a mildly disappointed reaction and maybe lose some interesting dialogue.\r\nFor the majority of the experience — outside the coffee-making elements — the game is laser focused and brim-filled with stories of customers. Nothing really significant or world changing, but mostly just provocative slice-of-life conversations that just fits perfectly with the coffee themed aesthetic of the game.\r\nYou, as the barista and shop owner, also participate in these charming conversations, but unfortunately without any dialogue choices or control over the narrative — aside from making the right or wrong servings or the new lost and found element, which doesn’t really matter much anyway. You can also access the commendable chat history feature, if you happen to miss or forget some of the conversations.\r\nYour coffee shop, 'Coffee Talk,' opens on a nightly basis and is the only coffee shop in the area open past midnight. The game progresses through different nights, with a variety of customers -- both regulars and newcomers -- sharing their stories. You can also come back to any night of the two-week story and replay them to your heart’s content.\r\nThe varied characters — from nerd orcs to immortal model vampires — are all interestingly written. They have actual realistic personalities for the most part that people can relate to, with their own problems and challenges in life, interacting with them feels engrossing and immersive.\r\nThe game is short and can be beaten in under five hours. As mentioned earlier, it just consists of around 14 nights to play out, which is similar in length to the first game. However, there is an endless mode for those who want to continuously make beverages without any narrative hurdles.\r\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is not a full-on sequel that tries to revolutionize the series. It is rightfully titled Episode 2 as it mostly retains the same art style, graphics, gameplay, and narrative direction with only minor additions to the recipe.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5211725) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Reporter - Scary Horror Game\r\n8.7\r\nAction\r\nSurvival horror\r\nReporter - Scary Horror Game, follows the story of a journalist who is investigating a mysterious series of macabre events. This investigation has taken him to this old, abandoned hospital. As the player, you take on the role of this journalist and must explore the hospital, solve puzzles, and uncover clues while avoiding monsters to progress through the game. The game features an unsettling atmosphere, mild jump scares, and a variety of Resident Evil 7 inspired puzzler gameplay.\r\nI started the game, and immediately, I was thrust into the creepy atmosphere and tone of the game. The gameplay mostly involves roaming around the hospital and using your trusty flashlight to light up the mostly dark interiors. Not even a minute into it, and there was already a mild jump scare of sorts that scared the @$%# out of me. I normally hate jump scares as they feel like a cheap way to scare players and audiences, but this time it felt fitting because of the extremely creepy setting of the game — it is only used sparingly and not moment after moment.\r\nThe puzzle elements are pretty standard, which range from finding hidden objects and manipulating the environment in order to uncover hidden clues, to the usual “live” puzzles where in this case – you need to untangle the wire configuration given a limited amount of moves to solve it. If not for the creepy and panic-inducing setting, it would have been a cake walk in the park, but the horror aspect of the game has made the puzzles more challenging, perhaps even extremely difficult, depending on how easily scared the players are.\r\nAside from puzzles, you also need to run and hide from monsters, failure to do so will result in death. There is no way to fight back, no weapons, no attacks. Just plain hiding which makes these kinds of games extra scary — which reminded me of the game Amnesia.\r\nSo far, I can say that a lot of thought has gone into crafting the tightly packed horrifying experience and this looks like a solid horror game to be immersed in and get extra scared. It has console-level graphics, and the visuals really look good for a mobile game, even more for a one dollar value without any in-app purchases.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5228661) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "DYSMANTLE\r\nGameplay\r\nDysmantle is a top down zombie survival crafting game developed by 10tons Ltd that is available on Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game takes place on a deserted island after a global disaster has wiped out most of humanity.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique 'Dysmantling' crafting system\r\n- Open-world map and mechanics\r\n- No pay to win mechanics\r\n- Controller Support## Cons\r\n-Can get repetitive and grindy\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nNew DLC ‘Doomsday’ coming out soon on mobile, and just released on PC.\r\nDysmantle takes place on a shelter island after a zombie apocalypse has wiped out most of humanity. You play as a survivor who wants to escape the island, as such, he must scavenge for resources, craft tools and weapons, and fight off dangerous creatures to stay alive and escape in this open-world island.\r\nWhile the game was originally released back in 2021, a new DLC titled “Doomsday” has just come out on PC featuring an all-new questline, open world map, and tools to use. It’s not yet available for the mobile platform — the version that I am playing — but is currently set to release later this year.\r\nOne of the most notable features of Dysmantle is its crafting system, or rather, the “Dismantling” system; Almost every object in the game world; furniture, appliances, barricades, doors, etc. can be dismantled by the crowbar into its component parts like wood and metal, which can then be used to invent and craft new items. Every object you dismantle in the game will give resources and experience.\r\nFor example, you can dismantle a car to get metal and rubber, which can be used to craft weapons and tools. This system is both innovative and incredibly satisfying. It encourages players to explore every nook and cranny of the island in search of new resources. It starts a little slow, with only a few items breakable because of the low-level crowbar and low-level character but once you power through that phase, it gets more interesting.\r\nAs for its level design, Dysmantle features an open-world design with Ubisoft-esque feel to it. You can roam around, unlocking link towers to reveal the map, discovering campfires as save and upgrade points, and leveling up your character and crowbar to unlock new tools and gadgets that give you access to previously inaccessible areas.\r\nThe island is huge and there are countless areas to explore. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter new areas, enemies, and obstacles that will require you to level up and explore even further to be properly equipped to survive. This makes the game incredibly engaging and gives players a sense of discovery and exploration.\r\nThe combat in Dysmantle is just a simple top-down system. Move your character around, and swing or fire your weapon on the target locked enemy. You can also dodge to quickly avoid enemies. You can craft a variety of weapons, such as knives, bats, and guns, to help you fight off enemies. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses. Dying is very forgiving — you just drop your current loot and respawn to the last campfire you visited — with the option to recover your loot if you visit your corpse where you died.\r\nThe enemies themselves are challenging but ultimately can be cheesed with a repeatable strategy to defeat. Overall, the combat is passable, but the touchscreen controls have made it slightly harder than using physical controllers.\r\nAs for the physical controllers, I’ve tested the game with a Razer Kishi controller and it properly supports physical controllers with the correct button prompts and the hiding of certain touchscreen controls.\r\nVisuals wise, the game has a vibrant color palette and a charming cartoonish art style that felt fitting for the top down view. The sounds are also decent, with proper sound bites for every hit to the furniture, metal objects, and other world elements that you want to dismantle. There is also a sound detection system for zombies as well, with zombies getting attracted the more noise you make.\r\nThe story of Dysmantle is interesting, if a bit vague. The game doesn't give you a lot of information about what happened to the world or why you're on the island from the get go. As you explore the island and explore various areas, you'll start to discover lore that explains the disaster. The story is not the main focus of the game, but it adds an extra layer of intrigue to the overall experience.\r\nDysmantle can be a bit repetitive and grindy. Once you've played for a few hours, you'll start to notice that you're doing the same things over and over again. You’ll explore areas, dismantle objects, defeat enemies, and then level up to be able to explore more areas, dismantle bigger objects, and defeat more powerful enemies. While this is all enjoyable, it can start to feel a bit stale after a while and repetitive.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5238688) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Ogu and the Secret Forest\r\n9.1\r\nAdventure\r\nHealing\r\nTest\r\nOgu and the Secret Forest is an early access title that looks like a top-down classic RPG game, but in reality it is more like an action-adventure game with an emphasis on puzzle elements. In this game you control baby Ogu, who was magically transported into another world without much explanation except that there is a war that is in dire need of a hero. What we know is that Ogu is a highly adventurous daydreamer and one that is not going to back down with the challenge of being a hero.\r\nThe game's hand-drawn characters and various types of puzzles provide a cute and immersive atmosphere. The game features different areas to explore, each with its own unique atmosphere and population characters, and players must solve puzzles and find hints to reveal the game's secrets and mysteries.\r\nThe combat is very simple, with only one main move to use – which is attack with Ogu’s trusty butterfly net. Ogu can sprint, so the combat is mostly trying to hit enemies one or two times then swiftly running away to avoid their attacks. There’s not much to it except for the various skills that you may unlock (there’s four slots), but I haven’t gotten that far yet to have any usable items.\r\nThere are two main difficulties, and the easier one basically makes the Ogu invulnerable. Perfect for those looking for a casual experience, or those looking for the narrative or puzzler elements only.\r\nThe inclusion of various gameplay features, such as collecting hats and masks with special skills attached; and meeting, helping, and getting helped by friends, adds a fun and engaging aspect to the Ogu and the Secret Forest. The cliche isekai story of the game works for the most part and it adds an intriguing factor. It is currently in Early Access, so expect more changes and additions this coming year.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5238624) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It is currently tagged as coming soon for both Android, with pre-registration now available, while the iOS version is available for Malaysia and Singapore regions.\r\nThe main focus of the game is collecting the different \"animal girls\" to assist you in battling the various monsters in an abandoned large-scale theme park where these animals girls reside. This Kingdom is a vast region with its varying landscape like grasslands, forests, and deserts.\r\nThe combat is unlike anything I've seen yet for a mobile gacha game, but is still kind of familiar with its Angry Birds-like gameplay.  You adjust the trajectory of the character and launch her to enemies, trying to circumvent any obstacles or platforms the level might present, upon landing she then attacks it with her special abilities. It's pretty unexpected to see these kind of gameplay style mixed-up with a character collecting gacha game, but this looks like a fun and exciting game to try regardless.\r\nThe game features Japanese voice acting for the characters, but it is expected to have various text localizations including English and Chinese. Of course, it features a typical gacha visual novel style story to drive the game forward, starting with an Isekai premise where your character is magically transported to this world of Kingdom, without memories, and are found by two animal girls.\r\nAs said earlier, pre-registration is now available, so if you're interested, this is the perfect chance to sign-up and get updates for any release information or upcoming playtest!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5239471) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "DYSMANTLE\r\n9.0\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nDysmantle takes place on a shelter island after a zombie apocalypse has wiped out most of humanity. You play as a survivor who wants to escape the island, as such, he must scavenge for resources, craft tools and weapons, and fight off dangerous creatures to stay alive and escape in this open-world island.\r\nWhile the game was originally released back in 2021, a new DLC titled “Doomsday” has just come out on PC featuring an all-new questline, open world map, and tools to use. It’s not yet available for the mobile platform — the version that I am playing — but is currently set to release later this year.\r\nOne of the most notable features of Dysmantle is its crafting system, or rather, the “Dismantling” system; Almost every object in the game world; furniture, appliances, barricades, doors, etc. can be dismantled by the crowbar into its component parts like wood and metal, which can then be used to invent and craft new items. Every object you dismantle in the game will give resources and experience.\r\nThe island is huge and there are countless areas to explore. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter new areas, enemies, and obstacles that will require you to level up and explore even further to be properly equipped to survive. This makes the game incredibly engaging and gives players a sense of discovery and exploration.\r\nThe combat in Dysmantle is just a simple top-down system. Move your character around, and swing or fire your weapon on the target locked enemy. You can also dodge to quickly avoid enemies. You can craft a variety of weapons, such as knives, bats, and guns, to help you fight off enemies. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses. Dying is very forgiving — you just drop your current loot and respawn to the last campfire you visited — with the option to recover your loot if you visit your corpse where you died.\r\nThe enemies themselves are challenging but ultimately can be cheesed with a repeatable strategy to defeat. Overall, the combat is passable, but the touchscreen controls have made it slightly harder than using physical controllers.\r\nIn summary, Dysmantle offers a fresh take on the zombie survival genre with its top-down view and unique crafting mechanics, which set it apart from the first-person and third-person zombie games that dominate the market. At just $10 for a one-time purchase and with a new DLC set to release this year, it's definitely worth a try for any survival crafting fans looking for a fresh new experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5234838) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Reporter - Scary Horror Game\r\nReporter is a first-person adventure horror game that takes place in an antiquated, abandoned hospital. The game is developed by AGaming+ and is available on Android devices.\r\n## Pros\r\n- creepy atmosphere\r\n- actually scary without using many cheap jumpscares\r\n- console-level graphics## Cons\r\n-very short, only an hour of story\r\n-inconsequential story\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\n## *Voice-overs are only in Russian language\r\n## *One-time purchase only with no IAPs\r\nReporter follows the story of a journalist who is investigating a mysterious series of macabre events. This investigation has taken him to this old, abandoned hospital. As the player, you take on the role of this journalist and must explore the hospital, solve puzzles, and uncover clues while avoiding monsters to progress through the game. The game features an unsettling atmosphere, mild jump scares, and a variety of Resident Evil 7 inspired puzzler gameplay.\r\nClear inspirations – but this isn’t just a simple clone.\r\nThe game is clearly inspired by both Resident Evil 7 with its puzzle gameplay, as well as the capturing the ambience and atmosphere of the now canceled Silent Hills’ P.T. (playable Teaser). Horror elements aside, the game is actually more reminiscent of classic adventure titles, because most of the gameplay is centered around solving puzzles to progress throughout the chaptered levels.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nI started the game, and immediately, I was thrust into the creepy atmosphere and tone of the game. The gameplay mostly involves roaming around the hospital and using your trusty flashlight to light up the mostly dark interiors. Not even a minute into it, and there was already a mild jump scare of sorts that scared the @$%# out of me. I normally hate jump scares as they feel like a cheap way to scare players and audiences, but this time it felt fitting because of the extremely creepy setting of the game — it is only used sparingly.\r\nWhile it has jumpscares, it doesn’t need them to be effective\r\nMajority of the scares are from the game being just outright creepy and unnerving. Dark hallways, mannequins, vague distant apparitions at the end of hallways and doorways, some poltergeist stuff going on knocking things off to the ground. I can say that a lot of thought has gone into crafting the tightly packed horrifying experience.\r\nFairly challenging puzzles made harder by the scariness factor\r\nThe puzzle elements are pretty standard, which range from finding hidden objects and manipulating the environment in order to uncover hidden clues, to the usual “live” puzzles where in this case – you need to untangle the wire configuration given a limited amount of moves to solve it. If not for the creepy and panic-inducing setting, it would have been a cake walk in the park, but the horror aspect of the game has made the puzzles more challenging, perhaps even extremely difficult, depending on how easily scared the players are.\r\nAside from puzzles, you also need to run and hide from monsters, failure to do so will result in death. There is no way to fight back, no weapons, no attacks. Just plain hiding which makes these kinds of games extra scary — which reminded me of the game Amnesia.\r\nConsole-like visuals\r\nThe game's graphics are impressive for a mobile game, with detailed textures and console-like realistic lighting effects that enhance the overall atmosphere of the game that stands out against the rest of other horror games on the mobile platform. The antiquated setting is neatly detailed, with each room and hallway providing a unique sense of dread and unease. The game's sound design is equally impressive, with eerie sound effects and a haunting soundtrack that help to build tension and create panic and a sense of impending danger.\r\nThe narrative and total playtime\r\nThe story is probably the weakest point of the game, as it follows a rather archetypical journalist’s mystery investigation gone wrong and doesn’t really involve the player that much nor provide an interesting driver to move the story or to pique the players’ curiosity. Most of its strengths stems from providing a genuine horror experience for players that is consistent from start to end.\r\nAs far as the story goes, Reporter is very, very short, clocking in at around an hour total of gameplay only — that is if you’re brave enough to endure the whole experience and solve the puzzles without much difficulty. The game is only voiced in Russian, but there is an option to display in-game text and subtitles in English or other languages.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5234886) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It is set to be released for both PC and Mobile (Android and iOS) with full cross-platform play.\r\nGraphics wise, the game looks phenomenal with AAA-level of visuals; featuring lush jungles, snowy mountains, exotic landscape, and floating cities; A style that closely resembles World of Warcraft (and it even looks better than that) with themes of high fantasy including the archetypical magic beings and heroic character classes.\r\nThe game will feature seven character classes to choose from: Ranger, Paladin, Warrior, Mage, Priest, Bard, and Barbarian Fighter. They are as standard as far as standard goes, but its making sure that players are already familiar with what they're choosing even before playing the game.\r\nSo far, the trailer showed action-packed combat gameplay featuring cooperative boss fights against a dragon and a gigantic sea creature. These will probably be high level raids that players can take on to gain massive rewards, requiring teamwork and party synergy to accomplish.\r\nTarisland is set to disrupt the live service mobile gaming scene with the promise of being a \"non-P2W\" title, meaning there is absolutely no way to increase the power of your characters from in-app purchases. Usually with these kinds of games, cosmetics will become the main revenue streams, similar to highly successful PC games like League of Legends or Valorant.\r\nThere is no firm release date yet for the game, but it is looking like its coming real soon, probably this year or the next. There are plans for a beta test and the game is current accepting applications for the next playtest, so you might want to sign-up now if you're interested in getting early access.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5239067) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It’s focus is realism over arcade racing, with the no nonsense catchphrase  “No Assist, No Excuses”.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Realistic driving physics\r\n- Photorealistic visuals\r\n- Real life tracks## Cons\r\n-P2W mechanics on top of being a paid game\r\n-Minor technical bugs\r\nStreet Kart Racing is not your typical Kart Racing game, it doesn’t feature arcade controls, power-ups, whimsical characters, and third person camera. Instead, it is a racing-sim in the likes of Gran Turismo or Assetto Corsa. That means first-person driving camera, realistic driving physics, photorealistic visuals, and long winded races.\r\nPhotorealistic visuals\r\nFirst of all, the graphics look impressive for what they're trying to do. I went in with this game blind and was not expecting to play a realistic sim-game with photorealistic graphics that value true realism over high definition textures or pretty lighting. The colors are just done right and captures that dull real-life “boring” color palettes.\r\nStarting the game, I was welcomed by real life racing superstar Nico Rosberg and a tutorial section which got me up to speed with the controls and how the game works. The game is just a simple no nonsense racing game; accelerate, turn corners, and get ahead of the competition to win races.\r\nRealistic driving physics\r\nWhile the controls are pretty straightforward, winning actual races is hard. Cornering is tough, and you can easily spin the kart out of control if you’re not careful. It’s not all unforgiving though, as you can easily call a marshall to “reset the vehicle” if you somehow mess up and get stuck. Instead of being hyper realistic with this, it now just takes you a few seconds to reset and get back into the race. When you’re ahead by a huge margin, this won’t even let opponents catch you.\r\nI did experience some collision/clipping issues where I bumped a wall and went straight right through it on multiple occasions, and some minor sound issues where the engine sounded a bit muted than expected. Despite featuring real human beings, especially real race superstars, their various different cut-outs guiding you throughout the gameplay systems felt a bit cheap.\r\nVarious control schemes\r\nThere are various control schemes to use: pure touchscreen, using the phone’s gyro controls like a steering wheel, inverted touch controls, and even the option to use physical controllers like the PS4 and Xbox types. Personally, I selected the Tilt (Pro) as it is the recommended one, to get an immersive feeling of having to use a steering wheel.\r\nUsing the tilt setting, the handling is actually done really well and feels like a real Go-Kart driving experience. You can tune the karts handling to fit your preferences; steering, braking strength, tire pressure, these aspect are simulated in the game. Albeit some of the fine tuning are locked behind higher level Kart Mechanics so they’re not initially accessible.\r\nReal-life tracks and real-time weather\r\nStreet Kart Racing also features real-life tracks, with real-time weather supposedly matching their real life counterparts. As expected, the weather will affect the handling and driving of the Karts, adding a lot of immersion to the driving-sim experience.\r\nThe whole gameplay loop if the game is to win races, therefore gaining currency when the event ends after real-time hours or minutes. Then proceeding to enter new classes and more expensive and faster Karts. While it is multiplayer focused, the majority of my time was spent racing with AI which are always readily available to match up against. Only the lap and times matter, and that will get compared to other players in an asynchronous multiplayer setup.\r\nP2W mechanics on top of being a paid game\r\nStreet Kart Racing costs $5, so I’m a bit surprised that they still included a limiting energy system for play, as well as in-app purchases not just for the cosmetics, but also to act as a pay-to-win element to speed things up. It’s bound to alienate many players, and rightfully so, P2W mechanics on top of being a paid game is just an unacceptable model these days.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5245245) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It has been recently released for PC and mobile platforms.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Charming and cute characters\r\n- Unique and familiar challenging puzzles to solve\r\n- Controller Support## Cons\r\n-Rudimentary combat system\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nStill in Early Access\r\nOgu and the Secret Forest is an early access title that looks like a top-down classic RPG game, but in reality it is more like an action-adventure game with an emphasis on puzzle elements. In this game you control baby Ogu, who was magically transported into another world without much explanation except that there is a war that is in dire need of a hero. What we know is that Ogu is a highly adventurous daydreamer and one that is not going to back down with the challenge of being a hero.\r\nCharming and cute\r\nThe graphics of Ogu and the Secret Forest are very charming, it features hand-drawn characters and environments and the general feel of the visuals transports me to the early 2000s’ boom of 2D flash games. However, gameplay wise, Ogu and the Secret Forest looks much more like a retro top down JRPG game made for kids, but looks are deceiving as it is actually an action-adventure game.\r\nAs said earlier, The game's hand-drawn characters and various types of puzzles provide a cute and immersive atmosphere. The game features different areas to explore, each with its own unique atmosphere and population characters, and players must solve puzzles and find hints to reveal the game's secrets and mysteries.\r\nStill in Early Access\r\nThe game is currently available as an Early Access title for now in both the Steam and Android versions. Currently, three main areas are available to be played in game while the current road map plans to add new areas called Harbor Town and Snow Town for the first half of 2023, with two more to be added in the second half of 2023.\r\nThe combat is very simple, with only one main move to use – which is attack with Ogu’s trusty butterfly net. Ogu can sprint, so the combat is mostly trying to hit enemies one or two times then swiftly running away to avoid their attacks. There’s not much to it except for the various skills that you may unlock (there’s four slots).\r\nThere’s not much to it when it comes to character customization and itemization, but Ogu can collect and equip different types of hats and masks and some of them might grant Ogu special abilities. Across the land, you will meet new people that can be called to help you in puzzle-solving and some will even offer side-quests to complete.\r\nI feel that the puzzles are the main source of challenge for the game.\r\nThe puzzles are fairly challenging, but if you’re thinking this game is for kids because of the cartoony and cute character designs and the simplistic combat, the gameplay itself is far from being kid-friendly. The puzzles will give you some challenge, many are pretty straightforward and familiar, but many of them can leave you scratching your heads before you can solve it.\r\nThere are two main difficulties, and the easier one basically makes the Ogu invulnerable. Perfect for those looking for a casual experience, or those looking for the narrative or puzzler elements only.\r\nController Support\r\nThe game also features proper physical controller support, as I’ve tested it with the Razer Kishi, featuring UI navigation but without button prompts. It also doesn’t switch layouts to closely resemble its PC counterpart – at least not yet.\r\nThe inclusion of various gameplay features, such as collecting hats and masks with special skills attached; and meeting, helping, and getting helped by friends, adds a fun and engaging aspect to the Ogu and the Secret Forest. The cliche isekai story of the game works for the most part and it adds an intriguing factor. It is currently in Early Access, so expect more changes and additions this coming year.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5245192) Originally posted on TapTap.",

From the FMV anime sequences to the fluid animations and special effects the characters and skills have. It is all very well made from an artistic and quality standpoint. The design of the waifu characters are also toned down and not over-exaggerated, and I like this relaxed approach.\r\nI also love the storytelling – the vibe feels very much like a good Anime series – which is no surprise as it is a direct follow up of the amazing Anime series takt op. Destiny as part of a mixed-media project. The anime was released last 2021, and this game is set to release two years later to continue the story — 2023 — after multiple delays. The game is told in multiple chapters and in a visual-novel style format, with small bits of FMV anime sequences in between.\r\nAside from the gacha system and turn-based combat. There are also various bonus game modes like a dating or relationship building aspect with the characters, beverage making mini-games, various quests, special missions, puzzles, and battle simulator dungeon crawling levels. This game packs a lot of things to do, and is coming out soon this year. I love the concept and the game has potential, and I think I’ll give Takt Op.Symphony a go once it releases.\r\nFull Review of the closed beta test will be posted soon here on Taptap!

So there is some semblance of idle gameplay in here, despite not being one.\r\nFrom the moment I started the game, it already looks high quality. From the FMV anime sequences to the fluid animations and special effects the characters and skills have. It is all very well made from an artistic and quality standpoint. The design of the waifu characters are also toned down and not over-exaggerated, and I like this relaxed approach.\r\nI also love the storytelling – the vibe feels very much like a good Anime series – which is no surprise as it is a direct follow up of the amazing Anime series takt op. Destiny as part of a mixed-media project. The anime was released last 2021, and this game is set to release two years later to continue the story — 2023 — after multiple delays. The game is told in multiple chapters and in a visual-novel style format, with small bits of FMV anime sequences in between.\r\nAs said earlier, it combines traditional console-JRPG with mobile gacha live service elements. The game feels like a proper JRPG, giving us the ability to control our character (in chibi form) in various 3D levels with some dungeon crawler aspects, while also featuring live service elements, like a gacha system for the characters and cosmetics, daily events and log-in bonuses, energy system, and in-app purchases.\r\nOne of the key features of Takt Op. is its emphasis on music. The game features a range of different musical themed characters, each with its own unique special abilities in battle. Players can also collect and upgrade these characters in a gacha manner to improve their damage and stats. How much lenient and pity rate the game will give upon release remains to be seen.\r\nAside from the gacha system and turn-based combat. There are also various bonus game modes like a dating or relationship building aspect with the characters, beverage making mini-games, various quests, special missions, and battle simulator dungeon crawling levels. This game packs a lot of things to do, and is coming out soon this year. I love the concept and the game has potential, and I think I’ll give it a go once it releases.\r\nDespite overall being an impressive and unique experience, I did find some minor gripes, like how everything feels so low in the game. Transitioning to different screens and UI elements take too long and the countless fade to blacks take away the immersion of an otherwise engaging game. Despite also the overall fluidity of the animations, I also found some stiffness in the idle low HP animations with the characters and enemies.\r\nGoing through the dialogue isn’t exactly a quality experience, as the system is prone to accidental skips and there is no way to immediately complete the whole dialogue box and you just have to let it slowly play out. Although as a consolation, you can view the current chat history to see any missed text-dialogue. The game dialogue is voiced in Japanese, but there are various text-localizations available including English.\r\nSo far with my experience with the closed beta test, Takt Op. Symphony is a unique and engaging RPG that combines JRPG elements with a gacha system, and has a distinct premise that I’ve never seen before with its focus on music as the main plot and gameplay element.\r\nIts colorful and fluid visuals, engaging storyline, and an anime prequel backing it, make it a great choice for fans of the genre, and is a treat for fans of the Anime looking for more Takt Op. content to consume.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5257522) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Developed by Morteshka and published by HypeTrain Digital, the game features an intruiging story, a beautiful art style, and adventure RPG mechanics.\r\nThe game follows the story of Vasilisa, a young sorceress who embarks on a journey to uncover the secrets of the Black Book — an ancient tome of immense power — to revive a loved one. Set in a fictional version of 19th century Russia, the game combines elements of mythology, history, and folklore to create a rich magical world that players will find captivating and engrossing.\r\nBlack Book features a card-based combat system. Or rather, \"page-based\". As wielder of the Black Book, Vasilisa collects magically ever changing pages and comes up with her own line-up to battle demons.Players collect these pages which represent spells and abilities and use them strategically in battles against supernatural creatures.\r\nIn addition to combat, the game also features role-play decision making, puzzles, and exploration elements. Players must solve puzzles to progress through the story, and they can choose to visit certain locations in the mini-map, deviate from the main quest, and explore the world to find additional items and secrets.\r\nIn some locations, a player will be presented with different choices, some having a good, neutral, or bad effect. Such as losing health, or gaining an item. The game overall strikes a good balance between combat, role-playing, puzzles, and exploration, ensuring that players always have something interesting to do.\r\nThe game's art style is also worth mentioning. The hand-drawn looking characters are beautiful and detailed, with a dark and moody atmosphere that perfectly captures the game's supernatural themes. The art style is switching back and forth between Another World-esque paint-like visuals for the 3D world, with more traditional 2D cartoonish visuals for the character dialogues. The game also features a fitting soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere and helps to create a sense of foreboding and uneasiness.\r\nHowever, Black Book can be slow at times, with long periods of explanation and dialogue inserted between combat and exploration sequences. The narrative can only do so much to keep players interested, and even with the various choices that you can make, it may not be enough for some. Also, the combat isn’t as flashy as anime-inspired games with turn-based combat, so players might find the presentation underwhelming.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "7.7\r\nAdventure\r\nArcade\r\nIn Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, A group of high school students find themselves trapped in their new school and are forced to participate in a twisted battle royale game of murder and survival.\r\nThe player takes on the role of Makoto Naegi, the game's protagonist and one of the students trapped inside the school Hope's Peak Academy. Throughout the game, Makoto must work with his fellow classmates to uncover the truth behind the school's mysteries and survive the deadly game they have been forced to play.\r\nThe game's main antagonist is Monokuma, a bear-like creature who forces the students to kill one another in order to escape. There are a bunch of house rules set for the students, but the main one is that they are trapped living in the school forever, unless somebody commits a murder against the other students, and then a trial begins.\r\nIf the killer is correctly revealed, the killer dies and the game continues. If not, then everybody else dies and the killer “graduates” and is allowed to re-enter the outside world. This trend of murder and trial will continue until  there are two students left. This is highly reminiscent of Werewolf or more popularly in recent times – Among Us mashed up with Battle Royale mechanics.\r\nThe game is divided into two main parts: the investigation phase and the class trial phase. During the investigation phase, the player must explore the school, talk to fellow students, befriend them and even build relationships. You can also gather clues and evidence to use during the class trial phase.\r\nThis includes examining crime scenes if there’s any, questioning witnesses, and searching for hidden items. The investigation phase is a crucial part of the game, as the evidence and clues gathered during this phase will be used during the class trial phase to solve murder mysteries. The system is pretty hand-holding and guided, ensuring the player sees all important information before leaving an area, and the option to just mark every interactable entity in a given scene.\r\nThe trial phase involves a series of mini-games that are used to determine the identity of the murderer. The player must use the evidence gathered during the investigation phase to refute false statements and identify the killer.\r\nThe game is divided into chapters, with each chapter focusing on a new mystery. While this works well for the most part, there are times when the game's pacing can feel slow, especially since it is mostly composed of reading text dialogue between the characters. Some of the investigation phases can drag on for hours, and the class trial phases which can also take 1-2 hours can feel repetitive after a while. Despite that, Danganronpa is a solid experience nonetheless if you are really immersed in its murder mystery story.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

Developed by Morteshka and published by HypeTrain Digital, the game features an Intriguing story, a beautiful art style, and adventure RPG mechanics.\r\nAn Intriguing russian folklore story\r\nThe game follows the story of Vasilisa, a young sorceress who embarks on a journey to uncover the secrets of the Black Book — an ancient tome of immense power — to revive a loved one. Set in a fictional version of 19th century Russia, the game combines elements of mythology, history, and folklore to create a rich magical world that players will find captivating and engrossing.\r\nThe whole premise is dark and moody, with the central themes being that of Demons and Witches, but it isn’t presented as a horror or scary element. In fact, Vasilisa faces these demons in a lighthearted manner, with her calm soothing voice and somewhat innocent demeanor standing out.\r\nA page-based combat system\r\nBlack Book features a card-based combat system. Or rather, “page-based”. As wielder of the Black Book, Vasilisa collects  magically ever changing pages and comes up with her own line-up to battle demons. Players collect these pages which represent spells and abilities and use them strategically in battles against supernatural creatures.\r\nEach card has its own unique effects and can be upgraded or combined with other cards to create more powerful combinations. Like focusing on solo or group damage, damage over time, defense, heal, and other buffs and debuffs.\r\nThe combat system is intuitive and easy to learn, yet offers plenty of depth and strategy for players to explore. As far as the translation to the touchscreen controls, it works well for the most part, but I found the card selection system tedious, because the card’s attributes are hidden below the screen, and you need to “peek” into each one to see the effects.\r\nIn addition to combat, the game also features role-play decision making, puzzles, and exploration elements. Players must solve puzzles to progress through the story, and they can choose to visit certain locations in the mini-map, deviate from the main ques, and explore the world to find additional items and secrets.\r\nIn some locations, a player will be presented with different choices, some having a good, neutral, or bad effect. Such as losing health, or gaining an item. The game overall strikes a good balance between combat, role-playing, puzzles, and exploration, ensuring that players always have something interesting to do.\r\nYour choices matter\r\nAs for the narrative, it is well-written and engaging, and is told with full quality voice acting – which is a nice touch to the overall “folklore or children story” feel. The game is heavily influenced by Russian culture, and players will encounter a variety of mythical creatures and supernatural phenomena throughout their journey. The game also features multiple outcomes and endings, based on the player's choices and actions, adding replay value and encouraging players to explore different paths and outcomes.\r\nCaptivating varied art-style\r\nThe game's art style is also worth mentioning. The hand-drawn looking characters are beautiful and detailed, with a dark and moody atmosphere that perfectly captures the game's supernatural themes. The art style is switching back and forth between Another World-esque paint-like visuals for the 3D world, with more traditional 2D cartoonish visuals for the character dialogues. The game also features a fitting soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere and helps to create a sense of foreboding and uneasiness.\r\nThe game offers four difficulty options with the second being the “normal” difficulty, so players can choose a level that suits their skill level and play style and will have little problems in advancing the story and focusing enjoyment over challenge.\r\nAside from the main campaign, an endless mode is also available that puts players in an overworld semi-linear map where they are free to choose their own starting point and branch out from there, meeting different characters, making dialogue decisions, and battling monsters.\r\nHowever, Black Book can be slow at times, with long periods of explanation and dialogue inserted between combat and exploration sequences. The narrative can only do so much to keep players interested, and even with the various choices that you can make, it may not be enough for some. Also, the combat isn’t as flashy as anime-inspired games with turn-based combat, so players might find the presentation underwhelming.\r\nConclusion\r\nBlack Book is a fantastic game that offers a fresh perspective and insight to Russian folklore. With its captivating story, beautiful art style, and adventure RPG card-centric gameplay, the game is sure to appeal to fans of classic adventure and role-playing games. While it can be slow-paced at times,I would still highly recommend trying out Black Book, especially since it is free to try on mobile, with the tutorial chapter and endless game mode free to play.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5271863) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "One Hand Clapping\r\nOne Hand Clapping is a 2D puzzle platformer game with innovative singing mechanics that requires the use of your microphone as a control input. It is available for PC, Xbox Playstation, Switch, and Mobile.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Innovative singing/humming mechanics\r\n- Creative use of singing mechanics to the puzzles\r\n- Beautiful landscape and levels\r\n- Accessibility and educational options## Cons\r\n-Not recommended to be played in public\r\nDeveloped by Bad Dream Games and published by HandyGames, One Hand Clapping is a one-of-a-kind 2D puzzle platformer that combines music, platforming, and puzzle-solving in a unique and innovative way that is sure to captivate players, and make them vocally exhausted.\r\nOne Hand Clapping features a hand-drawn colorful art style to go along a mix of gloomy and lighthearted themes. The landscapes of the world are beautiful and take players into a magical adventure of using the power of voice, to both control the environment and navigate it.\r\nInnovative singing/humming mechanics\r\nI went in blind with this game, with the only information I knew being that the game requires a microphone to control the characters. I actually thought the game involved clapping to control the characters, but I was surprised to find out that you actually need to sing or hum different tones in all sorts of different ways.\r\nOne Hand Clapping does not necessarily need an earphone to work and only encourages it. However, I tried it without one and the performance has been inconsistent, with the mic picking up feedback from the phone's loudspeakers. So with that experience I can say that this game is best played with an Earphone.\r\nThe first part seemed scary and gloomy at first, with pitch black levels and some mild visual jumpscares, but it turns out to be a lighthearted game overall, with melancholic overtones and an adventurous spirit to boot. One Hand Clapping introduces its singing mechanics quite slowly, only initially requiring the player to make some noise, then steadily making the mechanics more complicated by requiring a steady control of your tones, until eventually knowing how to produce tones by instinct.\r\nThe power of music\r\nThe game's mechanics rely heavily on the player's ability to use their singing voice to solve puzzles and progress through the game. The player takes on the role of a character who has the power to use their voice to affect the environment, be it to levitate huge stone blocks, bring power to elevators or lamp posts, sculpt the landscape to create a bridge, control flowers, and many more. The character still needs to be controlled via touch input, moving left or right or jumping, but most of the gameplay is focused on the singing element.\r\nWhile there seems to be a greater narrative overall with the main character and the world around him, the storytelling is basically non-existent with this game. No voice-acting, no narration, and no dialogue. While telling a silent story is indeed possible, this game has failed to make sense to me and looks like the focus is on having a fun and engaging experience like no other.\r\nCreative use of singing mechanics to the puzzles\r\nThe main character must journey through a world filled with musical landscapes and quirky characters for reasons unbeknownst to us. The player encounters many puzzles and environmental obstacles that call for his singing ability to be used, and these puzzles are creatively well done and do vary across the whole journey that feels fresh throughout the entirety of the experience.\r\nEach level is designed to challenge the player's vocal abilities and puzzle-solving skills. As said earlier, the game gradually introduces new and remixed mechanics and challenges as the player progresses through the levels, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting. The puzzles are cleverly designed and require the player to think creatively, and vocalize properly to solve them.\r\nThis unique gameplay mechanic sets One Hand Clapping apart from other games and creates a truly innovative and immersive experience. I was truly engaged playing the game with a control option other than my hands. It was a bit exhausting trying to vocalize various styles and levels of tone for prolonged periods, but it was a fun experience nonetheless. Just make sure the people around you are informed beforehand of what you’re doing, or they might get confused. It goes without saying that this game shouldn’t be played in public.\r\nAside from that, One Hand Clapping also offers various customization and calibration settings to fit your voice type. An educational mode that displays the actual notes of the current puzzles on the screen, As well as the option to skip these puzzles for those having difficulties.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5271995) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Shadows of Doubt\r\nShadows of Doubt is a sandbox detective game developed by ColePowered Games, featuring procedurally generated cities, voxel-based graphics, and an impressive lighting system.\r\nShadows of Doubt offers players an immersive detective experience in a customizable, procedurally generated city. The procedurally generated cities are based in an alternative hyper-industrialized version of the 1980s with its mixture of old technology and sci-fi noir vibes to it.\r\nEverything is real\r\nThe cities are fully explorable. Every nook and cranny, every room, floor, and even air vents are real places that you can visit in the game world. The resulting cities are believable; apartments, stores, rooms, electrical boxes, security cams that all work together to provide an immersive detective sim experience. It truly is a living, breathing world.\r\nThe gameplay is centered around your custom character, who is a detective that lives in an apartment. He takes on procedurally generated cases to solve, and the player is given freedom on how to solve it. Follow leads, scan fingerprints, organize evidence, use gadgets, scrounge through trash, and analyze the environment.\r\nDetective gameplay\r\nAs a detective, players must solve crimes by exploring every nook and cranny of the city, following leads, and collecting evidence to deduce the killer's identity. The game's sandbox approach gives players complete freedom to solve crimes in their own way.\r\nPlayers can use legal methods such as interviewing NPCs, obtaining search warrants, and gathering evidence through legal channels. Alternatively, players can resort to illegal means such as breaking and entering, stealing, lying to NPCs, or even using force to get information.\r\nThis freedom allows players to develop their own unique playstyle and create a personalized experience. To bolster its detective simulation experience, it also features a simple stealth system where sound and light are important to detection, especially when trespassing and doing illegal activities.\r\nThe game also boasts an amazing pin-system where all evidence you find, significant or not, can be pinned on a board and linked with each other to help you in your investigation. Group evidence together, link phone numbers, fingerprints, and addresses to various persons of interest. This allows players to create their own theories and develop a deeper understanding of the crime they are investigating. You can deduce the identity of the killer, or citizen-arrest him yourself for more rewards.\r\nRTX on?\r\nAnother super impressive aspect of Shadows of Doubt is its lighting system. The game's voxel-based graphics provide a unique look that is rather simple when it comes to models, but it's the lighting system that really makes the game stand out. It looks ray-tracing good, the way that light reflects off of surfaces and creates shadows is simply stunning. It's clear that the developers put a lot of effort into creating a visually stunning game that immerses players in a believable world, despite the rather blockiness nature of the voxel-based in-game models.\r\nAs with the sandbox nature, without a clear story or narrative, some players may also find the game's slow pace and lack of direction off-putting, as the game doesn't offer much guidance beyond the initial case briefing. However, there is sort of “manual” guidance available for the players to assist in their deduction-making gameplay. You can set waypoints to different places in the map, and the game will give you a waypoint and route to follow.\r\nEarly Access woes\r\nThe game is still in early access, but is showing immense promise with its already playable state. Optimizations are badly needed, as it struggled to run smoothly on my decent system (i7-8700k, 32GB, RTX 3080), with some bugs noticeable especially with NPCs interactions. Regardless, it is already a playable and acceptable experience. I initially tried playing on a controller, and while it was fully supported, the controls are evidently primarily designed for Keyboard and Mouse and it shows. It’s hard to navigate between UI elements using the controller and I highly recommended switching over to Keyboard and Mouse control.\r\nA true sandbox experience\r\nShadows of Doubt offers an immersive and rewarding detective experience. The freedom to solve cases in any way players see fit, combined with the game's detailed world and pin-system, make for a deeply engaging and satisfying experience. The game also offers a good amount of replay value even at its Early Access state, as players can try out different playstyles, reroll whole cities, and approaches to solving cases.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5271359) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The character still needs to be controlled via touch input, moving left or right or jumping, but most of the gameplay is focused on the singing element.\r\nThe main character must journey through a world filled with musical landscapes and quirky characters for reasons unbeknownst to us. The player encounters many puzzles and environmental obstacles that call for his singing ability to be used, and these puzzles are creatively well done and do vary across the whole journey that feels fresh every time.\r\nThis unique gameplay mechanic sets One Hand Clapping apart from other games and creates a truly innovative and immersive experience. I was truly engaged playing the game with a control option other than my hands.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5262361) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The player takes on a brand new role in Hajime Hinata, a student who has been accepted into Hope's Peak Academy, an elite school for \"ultimate\" students with exceptional talents worthy to be called “Ultimate”.\r\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a standalone title, with its all-new cast of high schoolers, but I would still highly recommend playing the predecessor first, because this feels more like an Episode 2 of an anthology series and the first game does a more natural job in introducing the overall premise.\r\nAs in the previous game, the gameplay of Danganronpa 2 consists of exploration, investigation, and class trials.

The 3D first person exploration phase is still present, but only at selected locations.\r\nSo far, the game is more or less on par with the first game, feeling like an Episode 2 that continues the theme of the series with only changes to the story, setting, and trials. While it can be a good entry point to the series, I highly recommend you play the first game first before this one. However, for those who have already enjoyed the previous game, this one is worth a try as well.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "In Card Hog - Dungeon Crawler, Players control a hero character who has the option to slide in any of the four directions in a customizable grid map setup represented by cards. The character starts with a base health and weapon, and a numerical stat that determines its strength when encountering other cards. Every turn, the character can head to any of the four directions which can either be an empty space, a hazard, an enemy, or an item like weapons and healing potions.\r\nCard Hog - Dungeon Crawler offers an engaging gameplay experience. Although there are multiple game modes, the main mode is structured around a series of dungeons, each with its own layout, traps, and enemies. The dungeons and its cards are procedurally generated, each playthrough will be different, so you can pretty much play endlessly.\r\nWhen your character encounters an enemy, both your numerical stat that represents the health points are compared with the enemy, bolstered by the number stat of your weapon. The higher numbered stat wins the conflict with points depleted depending on the stat of the enemy defeated. When a weapon stat reaches 0, it breaks, leaving the character vulnerable to damage. However, there are upgrades and healing potions that can restore your HP, or even increase the limit. New weapons can be picked up across the map as well.\r\nAs the player progresses through the dungeons, they will encounter boss battles, which are some of the most challenging with their own gimmicks in moving across the grid. These battles require careful planning, anticipation, and execution, and defeating a boss feels like a significant accomplishment.\r\nSpeaking of game modes, it features a traditional dungeon crawling system, with visits to a town named Hogsville in between as a reprieve for the players to buy temporary weapons, upgrades, and items from friendly merchants. Card Hog also features an endless mode, one with no breaks to Hogville and the game just continues endlessly until your character dies. There is also a zombie survival mode where the enemies are instead zombies that pop-out of the ground.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap!

    "body": "## Pros\r\n- A compelling murder mystery premise\r\n- Unpredictable story full of twists and turns\r\n- A mix gameplay of visual novel, first person exploration, and adventure\r\n- A sharp anime art style and a surprisingly good soundtrack## Cons\r\n-Pacing can be too much, game can feel long winded at times.\r\nA group of high school students find themselves trapped in their new school and are forced to participate in a twisted battle royale game of murder and survival.  The player takes on the role of Makoto Naegi, the game's protagonist and one of the students trapped inside the school Hope's Peak Academy. Throughout the game, Makoto must work with his fellow classmates to uncover the truth behind the school's mysteries and survive the deadly game they have been forced to play.\r\nMakoto is just a new student in Hope's Peak Academy, a prestigious school who has invited “Ultimate” students to enroll. These ultimate students are generally the best of the best when it comes to a certain aspect. Ultimate Pop Sensation, Ultimate Baseball Star, Ultimate Writing Prodigy, etc. You, on the other hand, are the Ultimate Lucky Student, an average student who just won an entry into the school via a lottery.\r\nThe game's main antagonist is Monokuma, a bear-like creature who forces the students to kill one another in order to escape. There are a bunch of house rules set for the students, but the main one is that they are trapped living in the school forever, unless somebody commits a murder against the other students, and then a trial begins.\r\nIf the killer is correctly revealed, the killer dies and the game continues. If not, then everybody else dies and the killer “graduates” and is allowed to re-enter the outside world. This trend of murder and trial will continue until  there are two students left. This is highly reminiscent of Werewolf or more popularly in recent times – Among Us mashed up with Battle Royale mechanics.\r\nThe over-the-top Anime-like characters have widely differing personalities, backstory, and possible motives. They are all well-written. It is definitely an intriguing premise especially with how the story and the characters are laid out. It’s a mix of Among Us and Battle Royale, but there is actually a compelling narrative being played out.\r\nAs for the graphics and soundtrack, it is a given that it looks like Anime, but the actual setup is the school is entirely rendered in a mix of 3D and 2D cell-shaded graphics, while the characters themselves are simplistic stationary cardboard cut-outs populating the map. The soundtrack is surprisingly good with a mix of upbeat electronic jazz and rock that perves a the perfect ambient music for all the murder mystery experience.\r\nThe game is divided into two main parts: the school life/investigation phase and the class trial phase. During school life, the player must explore the school, talk to fellow students, befriend them and even build relationships. When somebody dies, it switches to ‘deadly life’ where you can gather clues and evidence to use during the class trial phase.\r\nThis includes examining crime scenes if there’s any, questioning witnesses, and searching for hidden items. The investigation phase is a crucial part of the game, as the evidence and clues gathered during this phase will be used during the class trial phase to solve murder mysteries. The system is pretty hand-holding and guided, ensuring the player sees all important information before leaving an area, and the option to just mark every interactable entity in a given scene.\r\nThe trial phase involves a series of mini-games that are used to determine the identity of the murderer. The player must use the evidence gathered during the investigation phase to refute false statements and identify the killer.\r\nThe mini-games include a rhythm game where the player must shoot down words as they appear on the screen, a debate game where the player must match their evidence with the correct statement, and a puzzle game where the player must piece together the events leading up to the murder. These mini-games are kinda out-of-place but are a challenging yet fun experience, and they add a depth to an otherwise pretty guided investigation experience.\r\nAs the game progresses, the player will learn more about each character through their interactions with one another and through the investigation and class trial phases. The game does an excellent job of making the player care about the characters (including their own) and their fate, which makes the game's twists and turns (and there are a lot) all the more impactful.\r\nThe game is divided into chapters, with each chapter focusing on a new mystery. While this works well for the most part, there are times when the game's pacing can feel slow, especially since it is mostly composed of reading text dialogue between the characters. Some of the investigation phases can drag on for hours, and the class trial phases which can also take 1-2 hours can feel repetitive after a while. Despite that, Danganronpa is a solid experience nonetheless if you are really immersed in its murder mystery story.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5307477) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Grand Quest\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nPre-register\r\nGrand Quest is an all-new gacha third person game in a world where magic and technology co-exist. A Closed Beta Test is now open to players in the United States and Japan, with plans for more regions coming in later.\r\nGrand Quest is a gacha game set in a steampunk world full of anime and waifu characters. The art style is impressive and while it features gacha and waifu aspects, they’re not over the top and the characters are not blown out of proportions. Grand Quest is seemingly set in a steampunk universe where there is magic and technology, but the world is clean and pristine looking than most interpretations.\r\nThe game features an intriguing story where you are a highly talented arcanist student looking for your missing teacher, meeting all sorts of characters and enemies along the way. The story is investigative in nature and feels like a grand adventure of sorts, fitting the game's title.\r\nThe played named main character doesn’t actually fight, he just serves sort of a “supporting” role to the main squad which is composed of three main combatants, three supports, and one reinforcement from friends’ characters. The characters are all upgradable, have different rarities, and have unique ultimate abilities that when activated are presented in an awesome flashy manner – which can be turned off if you wish so.\r\nThe story is told in multiple chapters and missions, with the missions mostly composed of battles that players have to beat. The battles are generally played automatically, requiring no player input to control the character’s movements and attacks. But there is some sort of control over the automation of the use of items and abilities. As well as the option to focus fire on a single enemy, focus protection on a single ally, or deplete an enemy’s stamina to be able to stun him for a while, with bonus duration when the shield is “broken”.\r\nEach character has different abilities which are upgradable as well, after an appropriate resource and level has been met. There are also three items that you can carry, which are activated in accordance with the three aforementioned options that characters can do: focus fire, focus protection, and break shield. There is also a weakness system in place that closely resembles a rock paper scissors system.\r\nWhile Grand Quest can function as an idle game for short instances, it is not a full-on idle game, requiring player input to move across missions and quests, plus an incentive to actively monitor the battle, as automation can only take you so far and using the abilities and skills efficiently will generally result in a better performance.\r\nIn between the combat missions are cutscenes and dialogues between the characters, some of which are present in visual novel form, some are presented in a more unique animated comic-book style approach that’d be sure to catch the players’ attention. These cutscenes can be fast forwarded and even fully skipped, so there’s absolutely no need to sit through everything if you’re not interested.\r\nAside from the main story, there are various side game modes that are more focused on gathering resources and rewards, like Gold Rush, Fission Field, and Cargo Escort. They mostly follow the same gameplay format which is participating in combat with your squad.\r\nYou can upgrade everything in this game as part of the progression: your characters, weapons, skills, and participate in a gacha system where you can spend in-game resources and real money to draw characters.\r\nSince this is a closed beta test, note that not everything is finalized. Nevertheless, in the current state of the game, I was able to complete a couple of chapters and unlock various game modes with ease. There are no energy limiting systems I’ve encountered so far and this bodes well for the future of this game. So far, this game is promising and I hope they refine it even more.\r\nAs for technical issues, I have encountered various performance hiccups during my play, even if I was playing on the lowest settings. Granted, I was using a 2018 android flagship to play the game. Gameplay wise, my only gripe is the absurd hard to use targeting system when manually using the “focus fire” gameplay mechanic on the 'Goods Defense' game mode. Resulting in some pretty frustrating moments when I am trying to target a specific enemy.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5311053) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Defense Derby is a mobile multiplayer tower defense game featuring hero collection and a unique mind bending multiplayer format. It is currently in a beta test until May 11.\r\nDefense Derby is a simple game to play, monsters attack your square castle, and you have to place a variety of heroes on top of it to effectively survive the waves of enemies marching around and towards your castle gate.\r\nThe game features a mixed variety of heroes and units to use and place on top of the castle to do some wave defense. These units are your typical mages, archers, swordsman, rifleman, wizards, etc. that you’ll see in the fantasy genre, with everyone having their own unique attributes, attack ranges, and attack type. While heroes on the other hand serve as the leader of these units, they feature abilities that you can actively use in battle.\r\nThere are two main gameplay modes in Defense Derby, one is a singleplayer “Blitz” mode where you clear increasingly difficult stages with the use of your predetermined Unit and Hero lineup. While the “Derby” game mode is the multiplayer component and is the main star of the game.\r\nIn Derby mode, Four participants are given the same waves of enemies that they have to survive. Each participant faces these waves individually, and the last castle surviving wins. The four participants construct a deck of cards every round via “bidding”. They can start with two cards from their selected deck, and then every round a bidding is organized between the players to gain more cards and limit the other players’ cards as well.\r\nThe bidding is one of the most crucial parts of the PvP, as winning the bidding results in you taking the card up for auction, leaving the rest handicapped without any cards to add to their lineup. If the auction results in a tie, every tied participant gets the card.\r\nPer card in a bidding, An average price is suggested for all the players, and it’s up to them to decide how much they are willing to offer. Bid too much and you will be swimming in these units, but will be left with nothing, unabling you to participate in the next one, and sometimes, the next one is just a bit better than the last… or worse. Bid too little, and you will be losing the units, leaving you with plenty of resources but no units too.  So it becomes a careful balancing of resources as well, on top of playing mind games with the enemies with the bidding process.\r\nAside from bidding, Defeating a boss monster can grant players an extra card from their deck as well. To increase their chances of winning, players can combine similar units and synergize units depending on their position during conflicts, which adds a layer of strategy to the gameplay. Players can also reposition their units with a short cooldown, in order to effectively cover all sides while using only a few units.\r\nAdditionally, Defense Derby includes an event mode called Derby Free Fight - Mirror Match, where all players use the same provided deck, eliminating the deck-building aspect and allowing them to focus solely on unit/ability placement and strategic gameplay.  This mode is expected to result in exciting mental battles, as all participants must utilize the same deck.\r\nYou can unlock and collect many different types of units and heroes, as well as participate in a gacha like system in order to obtain these heroes. Since this is just a beta test, the whole model is not yet finalized but expect a decent amount of grinding or spending real money to unlock the more rare heroes and units. Still, I feel that this will be a fun game to pick up and play without the absolute need to spend money.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5310914) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With a mix of 2D Anime style and 3D cel-shaded style for the environment and a cardboard cut-off design for the characters. The art style is charmingly simple but it has aged well all things considered, while also featuring an impressive catchy upbeat soundtrack.\r\nIn a literal refreshing change of setting, the game now takes place on a tropical island called Jabberwock Island (instead of the original academy in the first game). The player takes on a brand new role in Hajime Hinata, a student who has been accepted into Hope's Peak Academy, an elite school for \"Ultimates\" students with exceptional talents worthy to be called “Ultimate”.\r\nThings quickly take a dark turn when Hajime and his classmates find themselves stranded on the island and forced to participate in a game of murder and deception orchestrated by a mysterious bear named Monokuma who has hijacked their vacation. Again, somebody needs to kill and manage to avoid being identified to escape the island and sentence everybody else to their death.\r\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a standalone title, with its all-new cast of high schoolers, but I would still highly recommend playing the predecessor first, because this feels more like an Episode 2 of an anthology series and the first game does a more natural job in introducing the overall premise.\r\nWhile the beach and island setting in Danganronpa 2 is indeed refreshing, it can also be a detriment because compared to the limited space of the high school where murders can take place, now six whole islands are available for all the students to roam and live in. This makes the murders a lot less believable to investigate, due to the massive increase in the scale of the location.\r\nThe main character this time around is not the Ultimate Lucky Student, but he has amnesia and can’t remember his Ultimate Ability, and still seems to still be an average joe like the first game’s protagonist and ultimate lucky student, adding more intrigue to the premise aside from the obvious impending murder mystery.\r\nAs in the previous game, the gameplay of Danganronpa 2 consists of exploration, investigation, and class trials. The island is divided into various locations, each with its own destinations, secrets and mysteries to uncover.\r\nPlayers first play ‘daily life’ segments for each chapter, where the character is free to explore, talk, and build relationships with the character – which is then usually cut short by a murder. The game now switches to the ‘deadly life’ where they must investigate crime scenes, gather evidence, and interview NPCs in order to solve the murders that occur throughout the game.\r\nThe class trials, which take place after a murder has been committed, are the main source of “action” of the game. They consist of various minigames, such as debates, rebuttals, and logic puzzles, and require the player to use their deductive skills to uncover the truth and identify the killer.\r\nThe sequel now features much longer winded cases that can even take up to double the time compared to the first game. Especially the trials which can get tedious with all the back and forth-ing with the characters debating. However, the logic used in the murders have become more exaggerated and the suspension of disbelief needed are at a high. Consequently, I feel that the design of the case and trial are inferior to the first one.\r\nThe cast of characters are mostly on par with the first game. Well-written, full of personalities, and are a careful mix of both cliche tropes and subverting the players’ expectations.\r\nTo accommodate the game’s larger setting, the game now switches from a traditional first person exploration to a 2D side scrolling exploration, with the character now in sideways view. The 3D first person exploration phase is still present, but only at selected locations.\r\nThe various minigames that make up the class trials are all challenging and engaging, and the game does an excellent job of gradually introducing new mechanics over the course of the game. As for the investigative pace, the game also does a good job of guiding the player in interacting with the environment and finding clues.\r\nOne potential downside of the game is its pacing. The game is quite long, even longer than the first game. It is told in chapters divided into different phases (daily life, deadly life, and trials) taking several hours to complete each. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, some players may find that the game's slow pace can drag at times, especially in the trial phase. Additionally, some of the minigames that make up the class trials can be needlessly frustrating or tedious, which can detract from the overall experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5307616) Originally posted on TapTap.",

But does that not mean that the game lacks depth nor is not fun. In fact, it's probably one of the best cross-play sports games right now.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5310853) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Card Hog - Dungeon Crawler\r\nCard Hog - Dungeon Crawler is a card swiping rogue-lite mobile game that combines elements of card game, dungeon crawling, and sliding mechanics as seen in block or number puzzle games such as Unblock me or 2048.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Easy to pick-up and learn\r\n- bright, colorful, and cartoony visuals\r\n- High degree of replayability## Cons\r\n-No Cons\r\nPlayers control a hero character who has the option to slide in any of the four directions in a customizable grid map setup represented by cards. The character starts with a base health and weapon, and a numerical stat that determines its strength when encountering other cards. Every turn, the character can head to any of the four directions which can either be an empty space, a hazard, an enemy, or an item like weapons and healing potions.\r\nThe system is easy to pick-up and is a splendid mix of puzzle and card-based gameplay that is sure to challenge players while also giving them a pretty simplistic pick-up and play gameplay experience. In other words; easy to learn, hard to master.\r\nThe game's graphics are bright, colorful, and cartoony, giving it a lighthearted and whimsical feel. The characters, especially the titular Card Hog, are adorable and endearing, and the dungeons themselves are creatively designed and filled with interesting details.\r\nCard Hog - Dungeon Crawler offers an engaging gameplay experience. Although there are multiple game modes, the main mode is structured around a series of dungeons, each with its own layout, traps, and enemies. The dungeons and its cards are procedurally generated, each playthrough will be different, so you can pretty much play endlessly.\r\nWhen your character encounters an enemy, both your numerical stat that represents the health points are compared with the enemy, bolstered by the number stat of your weapon. The higher numbered stat wins the conflict with points depleted depending on the stat of the enemy defeated. When a weapon stat reaches 0, it breaks, leaving the character vulnerable to damage. However, there are upgrades and healing potions that can restore your HP, or even increase the limit. New weapons can be picked up across the map as well.\r\nThe combat is simple but with the procedurally generated roster of cards constantly surrounding the player, it can become a challenging ordeal that both feels like you’re solving a puzzle and playing a card game at the same time.  Defeated enemies and treasure chests drop a variety of items, including coins, healing potions, and new cards for the player's deck.\r\nAs the player progresses through the dungeons, they will encounter boss battles, which are some of the most challenging with their own gimmicks in moving across the grid. These battles require careful planning, anticipation, and execution, and defeating a boss feels like a significant accomplishment.\r\nSpeaking of game modes, it features a traditional dungeon crawling system, with visits to a town named Hogsville in between as a reprieve for the players to buy temporary weapons, upgrades, and items from friendly merchants. Card Hog also features an endless mode, one with no breaks to Hogville and the game just continues endlessly until your character dies. There is also a zombie survival mode where the enemies are instead zombies that pop-out of the ground.\r\nWhen you die, the game scores you based on your total moves survived, kills, and damage dealt. All progress is reset to the next game, but there is persistent progress in the form of upgrades, cosmetics, and different unlockable characters.\r\nConclusion\r\nCard Hog - Dungeon Crawler is a decent game that offers a unique and engaging gameplay experience. Its procedurally generated levels and card-based mechanics offer a high degree of replayability. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy card games and dungeon-crawlers.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5307530) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Omega Strikers\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nGet\r\nOmega Strikers is a sports multiplayer mobile game that combines Moba mechanics along with the sport soccer and air hockey.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Feels just like any other fun sport to play\r\n- Integrates MOBA elements into its sport gameplay very well\r\n- Free-to-play with no pay to win elements\r\n- Controller support## Cons\r\n-No clear distinction with the roles gameplay wise\r\nImagine if Air Hockey was instead played in human size with six players having their own superhuman powers with absolutely no physical restraints or rules, Omega Strikers is exactly just that and more. It is a 3v3 free-to-play multiplayer game that is available for Mobile, PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Switch, with complete cross-play functionality. For the purpose of this article, I will be talking about the Mobile version with predominantly touchscreen controls.\r\nBefore diving into the specifics, I would like to jump ahead and say that Omega Strikers is absolutely a fun game to experience, and feels as fun as about every other popular sport out there. It also has an added layer of fun by introducing a MOBA gameplay style with different characters to select and abilities to utilize.\r\nOmega Strikers starts you off by letting you select what position to play. Goalie, Forward, or a Any Role (called Flex in-game). A goalie’s job to protect the goal while Forwards either focus on the combat or striking the “Core” to score a goal. They’re just labels though, with no real difference gameplay wise.\r\nGameplay wise, a goalie and a forward are just the same with no strict mechanical difference, a forward can still protect the goal and a goalie can still go out of the goal area.  This gives players more freedom to play, but is its own detriment in properly giving players roles. Some goalies, especially newbies, have a tendency to abandon their goals and do some hero ball, leaving no one to protect the team goal. Same goes for the forwards who would do nothing to advance the ball and won’t try to score. Some gameplay mechanics could have been made to further accentuate the role difference for players.\r\nThen the game lets you select your character, with their own ability lineup. Then the perks you will need, depending on your playstyle. As for the actual gameplay, the game involves two 3 player teams trying to push the “Core” around and eventually into the opposite goal, while trying to battle with other players and inflict damage to stun, or even take them out of the game for some time.\r\nThe battles are ultimately super fun, with the constant back and forth of the Core and the different abilities that the characters use: from the simple dash kick and energy blasts, to the more complex skills that for example spawns walls to block enemies. Overall, the controls are well-built and a lot responsive considering the fast-paced nature of the sport.\r\nThe skills are all interesting and varied enough, and the first three characters available for free perfectly embody the three main roles that players might take: A goalie focused tank , a scoring oriented melee forward, and a damage dealer ranged forward. Players can either focus on the Core only – either offense or defense, or also consider doing some heavy damage to enemies to incapacitate them and make scoring more easier.\r\nThe two main modes to play in Omega Strikers are Normal and Competitive. Normal is just a short pick up game where the first team to score 5 wins. While competitive is a much more complex game mode with character bans and multiple ‘race to 3’ sets to win the whole match.\r\nThe maps also play a factor in Omega Strikers. Initially the goals in the game are blocked by a wall, until a certain mechanic is met by the players. This may mean hitting the wall, or a map element, to be able to trigger the opening of the goal for the opposing players. This means there is an initial fight for the players to unlock their opponents’ goal, and gives players more leeway in the first few seconds of the round.\r\nAs traditional with these free-to-play sports games, the game features a live service model; passes, cosmetics, missions, and login bonuses are available for players to partake in. Featuring three main currencies, one for unlocking new Strikers, another for cosmetics, and lastly a premium currency using real money. Fortunately, it does not have an energy system to limit playtime.\r\nSince this is a game that is available for the majority of the gaming platforms, it's not surprising that the mobile version also supports physical controllers to some degree. You can control the characters using the controller, but you still need the screen for UI navigation.\r\nOverall, there’s not much complexity to the game aside from playing 3v3 matches and mastering the skills and abilities of characters, as well as the actual sport itself. But does that not mean that the game lacks depth nor is not fun. In fact, it's probably one of the best crossplay sports games right now. If Soccer has its Rocket League, then Air Hockey has Omega Strikers.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5311055) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Defense Derby\r\n8.1\r\nStrategy\r\nTower Defense\r\nDownload\r\nDefense Derby is a simple game to play, monsters attack your square castle, and you have to place a variety of heroes on top of it to effectively survive the waves of enemies marching around and towards your castle gate.\r\nThere are two main gameplay modes in Defense Derby, one is a singleplayer “Blitz” mode where you clear increasingly difficult stages with the use of your predetermined Unit and Hero lineup. While the “Derby” game mode is the multiplayer component and is the main star of the game.\r\nIn Derby mode, Four participants are given the same waves of enemies that they have to survive. Each participant faces these waves individually, and the last castle surviving wins. The four participants construct a deck of cards every round via “bidding”. They can start with two cards from their selected deck, and then every round a bidding is organized between the players to gain more cards and limit the other players’ cards as well.\r\nAside from bidding, Defeating a boss monster can grant players an extra card from their deck as well. To increase their chances of winning, players can combine similar units and synergize units depending on their position during conflicts, which adds a layer of strategy to the gameplay. Players can also reposition their units with a short cooldown, in order to effectively cover all sides while using only a few units.\r\nYou can unlock and collect many different types of units and heroes, as well as participate in a gacha like system in order to obtain these heroes. Since this is just a beta test, the whole model is not yet finalized but expect a decent amount of grinding or spending real money to unlock the more rare heroes and units. Still, I feel that Defense Derby will be a fun game to pick up and play without the absolute need to spend money.\r\nFull Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5307399) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Arto\r\nArto is an action-adventure hack and slash game featuring a world full of — or devoid of — vibrant colors, an action-packed challenging combat, and a mesmerizing atmosphere.\r\n## Pros\r\n- novel gameplay use of colors\r\n- mesmerizing atmosphere\r\n- challenging boss fights\r\n- simple but fluid combat system## Cons\r\n-shoddy camera work\r\nIn the world of Arto, an event known as the Chromacylsm has drained all color, and our protagonist has been chosen to restore it and save the land. Players control Liv, an apostle of Goya, the chromatic Divinity of the Painted Arto. Liv is unaware of what is happening, and is unraveling the plot's mysteries alongside the player despite being destined for this task.\r\nLiv, as the chosen one, possesses the ability to imbue vibrant color into anything she encounters: the surrounding land, trees, water, and the entire landscape. This novel element provides a deeply therapeutic and satisfying experience, drawing players into a state of addiction as they traverse the world around them, the urge to bring colors to just about everything and see it come to life. Additionally, this remarkable feature serves as a secondary function, acting as a helpful indicator for locations that have already been explored.\r\nThe gameplay experience of Arto is a highly mesmerizing one, with a great combination of a soothing soundtrack as well as a vibrant world full of beauty, wonder, as well as mystery. The actual gameplay is more of a third person action-adventure hack and slash, with fixed isometric camera angles. It has platforming and souls-like elements with regards to the movement and combat.\r\nArto’s combat is simple, but highly challenging. Liv can dash, block or parry, and attack a simple melee combo attack with her magic sword. The whole combat motion of dodging, parrying, and hitting enemies is very fluid and highly satisfying to perform. There are other weapons later on in the game, as well as the ability to shoot beams of paint.\r\nDefeating regular mobs is easy enough and can be repetitive, but the visual effects are impressive enough that it never fails to be gratifying every time.  The boss fights on the other hand are very challenging, requiring timing, great reflex, and mastery of the bosses telegraphed attacks in order to best them.\r\nDying respawns you back to the last checkpoint, but it's not without its drawbacks, as you will lose all your “Chroma” which is a resource you accumulate in the world via progression, exploration, and killing enemies. You use chroma to upgrade and unlock abilities, such as an increased health flask capacity, or an additional dash. Fortunately, going to the last place you died gives you the opportunity to recover your lost Chroma.\r\nWith the game’s dash/dodge, healing, and death/resource mechanic, the game very much feels like a Souls-like game in many respects. Especially with how some of the boss fights will turn out to be like. However, it's not frustratingly hard and it’s not necessarily a hardcore type of game. If something is frustrating in this game, it’s the bad camera work. Sometimes blocking your view of the combat or just plain hiding the characters and enemies behind world objects.\r\nArto also takes the players on a colorful and delightful journey across various biomes with differing art styles and brings different mechanics to the equation. There are some slight platforming and puzzle elements to the game, but nothing really extraordinary with it. Most of the magic comes from the highly satisfying ‘color everything around you’ gameplay, as well as the fluid combat.\r\n\\\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5322879) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "City of Beats\r\n7.1\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nCity of Beats places a strong emphasis on music as a fundamental component of the gameplay, rather than simply serving as background sound. The game utilizes synchronized beats to enhance the player's experience, with even explosions, hazards, and projectiles matching the rhythm to create a harmonious connection between the player's reactions, reflexes, and the music.\r\nCity of Beats puts players in control of a contractor tasked with eliminating a rogue AI that has taken over several cities. Using a futuristic flying car, players travel from rooftop to rooftop, engaging in countless battles against waves of robots. The ultimate goal is to confront and defeat the rogue AI in a climactic showdown.\r\nPlayers assume control of the contractor in a twin-stick shooter style, allowing them to maneuver while seamlessly aiming and shooting at the same time. The game's bullet-hell nature can be challenging, but players can use a dash move that offers brief invincibility frames to evade incoming fire. As players defeat enemies, they can collect orbs that offer a variety of benefits, such as replenishing health or shields, or providing resources that can be used later on.\r\nAs players make their way through different rooftops, they are presented with branching paths to choose from, each offering different potential rewards that are previewed beforehand. These rewards can range from weapon mods and upgrades to opportunities to visit shops for trading or engaging in battles against tougher robots for even greater rewards.\r\nAt the end of each level, players are given a choice between different rewards, such as two weapon mods offering either an increased range, or perhaps a doubled projectile amount, for example.\r\nUnlike many rogue-lite games, City of Beats is not exceedingly hard, and I was able to beat it in a few runs and in a single sitting. However, the fun does not stop there, as the game can be endlessly played for long periods of time, especially with the various weapons, attribute increases, and upgrades you haven’t tried yet. Ultimately, it is a short game overall, and you might be done with the game in just a few hours of play.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5322572) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With updated graphics and refined gameplay mechanics, Age of Wonders 4 promises to be a worthy successor to the critically acclaimed Age of Wonders III, offering players even more depth, complexity, and replay value than ever before.\r\nAge of Wonders 4 starts off with the faction and realm creator, both of which are highly immersive elements that further enhance the role-playing aspect of the game. While players can definitely choose from one of the many options, they can create their own based on their playstyle or role-playing needs, and the options given are abundant. It is a game in itself that completely surpassed my expectations and gave me plenty of options in shaping my desired faction to play with and realm to play in.\r\nAs for the actual gameplay, players start off with a city, which they can build upon to expand to other surrounding land, which are grouped into provinces. As the population expands, so does the city. Along the way, they will meet other factions, and smaller factions called Free Cities, engaging diplomacy in various ways. The diplomacy is very well done; it's comprehensive with all the logical options you would expect from a diplomacy system and adds another layer of strategy and immersion of being a leader to the game.\r\nAge of Wonders 4 offers a wide variety of units and structures, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. Each city will have their own unit line-up for players to build and it is predominantly determined by the race-type of the city. Heroes — starting with the faction Ruler — can lead cities and armies, and more can be recruited to your empire as you play.\r\nThere are random events and quests which constitute a big chunk of the role-playing aspect. With random encounters, events, giving players the option to approach it in various ways. These choices matter and will affect how your empire is shaped, both directly and indirectly.\r\nBattles between units can be approached in two different ways. It can be auto-resolved, or done manually. When in manual mode, the combat system is another separate game of its own, with a switch to a tactical layout of the hex tile they’re in, and these different units and heroes can use different abilities to defeat their enemies. Players will need to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each unit, as well as the terrain, flanking, and other factors (such as being in a city siege), in order to come up with a winning strategy.\r\nThe winning conditions are defined by the player, either by military where you need to defeat all factions; expansion where you need to take over a huge portion of the map; magical prowess – which is basically researching enough tech and completing the objectives; or achieving the highest score when the game's predefined turn limit ends. Every condition caters to a certain playerstyle and benefits players of all types.\r\nAs a first time experience, the whole learning curve is very accessible. Even though Age of Wonders 4 is extremely complex and has many different layers to it, the tutorials are nicely done and enhance the whole initial starting experience instead of annoyingly interrupting the player. It also helps that the game is straightforward when it comes to the logic behind the resources, diplomacy, and warfare.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5335668) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The environments are minimalistic but recognizable, with each chapter featuring unique architecture and design. The game's user interface is simple and intuitive, with a clean and modern design that fits perfectly with the game's overall aesthetic.\r\nThe story is simple and involves the player character, a lone explorer looking to find the “Princess” and his journey into an ancient cyberspace of a mysteriously vanished civilization. It is mostly told through a series of short minimalistic cutscenes and bits of dialogue with various entities you encounter. While the premise is intriguing, the actual plot is not particularly deep or memorable. That being said, the story is more of a backdrop for the puzzler gameplay than a main focus.\r\nThe music is a mix of synthwave and futuristic, with a heavy emphasis on beats and energetic tones. The sound effects are also well done, with each action in the game accompanied by a satisfying sound, the game even recommends the players to wear earphones for better immersion, although I personally feel that this isn’t necessary.\r\nThe gameplay in Hyperforma revolves around solving puzzles by moving and rotating geometric shapes. You can rotate the puzzle in all axes but the last one requires the use of two fingers. The whole gameplay formula of Breakout or Brick Breaker is literally spun in on itself by instead letting the player bounce around the screen, with the ability to launch the user towards the center of the puzzle, hitting and breaking other obstacles, clearing the way towards the “core” of the puzzle.\r\nThere is a “core” in the middle that needs to be reached by the protagonist, and is protected by various shapes of different characteristics: some will break, some can be activated that results in various effects — some positive, some negative; some are hazardous to the player and can eliminate the protagonist. You can freely rotate the puzzle at all times to help the player, and it all becomes an engaging puzzle game that requires spatial awareness, timing, prediction, and reflexes.\r\nIn addition to rotating the puzzles and launching the protagonist towards the puzzle, players can also unlock skills as he levels up, and activate them to varying effects, increased breaking power, cloning the user, or shrinking anything it hits.\r\nAt the end of the chapters, there is an out-of-place boss fight that instead revolves around — quite literally — the bosses and you have to avoid its projectiles while continuously shooting it to damage. It’s kinda its own separate thing from the puzzles, feels like an unnecessary addition, and throws away every skill you’ve unlocked and practiced.\r\nHyperforma starts off relatively easy, but quickly ramps up the difficulty as you progress through the levels and chapters. These puzzles require a mix of logic, spatial awareness and reflexes. There were several moments where I had to stop and really think about how to proceed instead of blindingly launching myself towards the center. While the gameplay is challenging, it never feels unfair or frustrating. Each puzzle feels like a gratifying achievement when you finally reach the center.\r\nWhile the game is free-to-play, it is littered with intrusive ads that play every level or two, as well as appearing on top of the screen real estate while playing. Besides that, there is also an option to watch ads to get better rewards, or just outright purchase the premium version for a cheap price of $5.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5340145) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Age of Wonders 4\r\nGameplay\r\nIn Age of Wonders 4, players take on the role of a leader of an extremely customizable faction in the game and strive to conquer the land in various ways, participate in diplomacy, combat, research, and empire management gameplay to create a deeply immersive and strategic gameplay. Players will be able to customize their armies, heroes, and cities, as well as explore a vast and dynamic world filled with hidden treasures and powerful artifacts.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Extreme faction and map customization\r\n- Immersive empire building and roleplaying mechanics\r\n- Engaging diplomacy and tech trees\r\n- Postgame progression system\r\n- Controller Support, unheard of in strategy titles## Cons\r\n-Minor UI selection issues\r\nWith updated graphics and refined gameplay mechanics, Age of Wonders 4 promises to be a worthy successor to the critically acclaimed Age of Wonders III, offering players even more depth, complexity, and replay value than ever before.\r\nExtreme faction and map customization\r\nAge of Wonders 4 starts off with the faction and realm creator, both of which are highly immersive elements that further enhance the role-playing aspect of the game. While players can definitely choose from one of the many options, they can create their own based on their playstyle or role-playing needs, and the options given are abundant. It is a game in itself that completely surpassed my expectations and gave me plenty of options in shaping my desired faction to play with and realm to play in.\r\nPlayers can freely customize their faction, starting from a selection of physical form; the looks, even the physique and army colors are customizable. Players can also choose between different culture types like being a barbarian or a feudal society, society traits to further personalize the race, a start “Tome” which is basically the magic tech tree to define your factions alignment, and finalize it with the faction Ruler customization.\r\nThe Ruler is even more customizable, and it functions like a RPG character creator where you can just about change any aspect of its physical appearance.\r\nNot only that, but the realm you choose to play in is incredibly customizable. Again, premade realms are already built-in for players to choose, but you can definitely customize your own depending on your role-play needs and the challenge you're looking for.\r\nA flat continental map filled with fertile land, a lush forest filled with mountains and ancient wonders, or maybe a lava-filled world populated by huge creatures. Not only the landscape, but also the traits of the realm can be finetuned: Make everyone immortal, fill the land with demons, or make random tiles warp from one form to another, among many other options. Realms are generally composed of a ground level map and an underground level as well to effectively double the playground.\r\nGameplay Analysis\r\nAs for the actual gameplay, players start off with a city, which they can build upon to expand to other surrounding land, which are grouped into provinces. As the population expands, so does the city. Along the way, they will meet other factions, and smaller factions called Free Cities, engaging diplomacy in various ways. The diplomacy is very well done; it's comprehensive with all the logical options you would expect from a diplomacy system and adds another layer of strategy and immersion of being a leader to the game.\r\nYou can engage in treaties, engage in friendly talks, or start a war; justified or unjustified. If you’re friendly or powerful enough, you also have the option of vassalizing the Free Cities, or integrating them into your empire. Although it will take more effort, even the other main factions can be approached in this manner.\r\nThere are various resources that are in play: Gold for general use, Knowledge for researching Tomes, Mana to cast spells, and Imperium for Empire related actions. Each city also has its own granular resources for individual development, food to expand the population, production for building, and draft for army recruitment. Even though there are various resources, every one of them is straightforward and easy to understand and there are no overly complex resource systems in place.\r\nDeep and complex game mechanics\r\nFor the research, there are two main research trees. 'Tomes' that are dynamically changing choices, which affect your empire's affinity and spiritual alignment. 'Empire Development' which is also directly tied to affinities and gives instant bonuses once activated. They can be both done separately and concurrently, and have widely different mechanics of being utilized which adds a lot of depth to the overall progression.\r\nAge of Wonders 4 offers a wide variety of units and structures, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. Each city will have their own unit line-up for players to build and it is predominantly determined by the race-type of the city. Heroes — starting with the faction Ruler — can lead cities and armies, and more can be recruited to your empire as you play.\r\nThese heroes are treated like an RPG character, with equipable weapons, leveling system, and skill tree progression. Players can also summon magical beings, recruit them from Free Cities, or even come across the opportunity to recruit them via random events and quests.\r\nRoleplay to your heart’s content\r\nThere are random events and quests which constitute a big chunk of the role-playing aspect. With random encounters, events, giving players the option to approach it in various ways. These choices matter and will affect how your empire is shaped, both directly and indirectly. From simple rewards and resource benefits, to more affinity and faction-relation changing consequences. These well written events that the player encounters while exploring the world and building his/her empire add so much flavor to the gameplay.\r\nCasting spells on the overworld map\r\nSpeaking of flavor, you can also cast spells not only in battle, but in the empire overworld. Allowing you to cast unlocked 'world spells' using Mana and reap the benefits. Some passive spells may improve the durability of all your units, enhance them in sieges, or just outright increase their damage output. Some spells are actively casted: spawning Ethereal Warriors, teleporting friendly units, or terraforming the land.\r\nThe combat is another game of its own\r\nBattles between units can be approached in two different ways. It can be auto-resolved, or done manually. When in manual mode, the combat system is another separate game of its own, with a switch to a tactical layout of the hex tile they’re in, and these different units and heroes can use different abilities to defeat their enemies. Players will need to carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each unit, as well as the terrain, flanking, and other factors (such as being in a city siege), in order to come up with a winning strategy.\r\nThe combat system is highly engaging and rewards tactical thinking and careful planning, making battles another highlight of the gameplay experience, but an optional one, as larger battles can take considerably long. I highly commend the included 'watch replay' option to allow you to watch the battle at “full speed” without pauses, as well as the ability to watch the battles play out by itself even if you had just auto-resolved it.\r\nThe AI is highly formidable and challenging, while still being fair. In my experience, it didn’t find any issues playing with or against it. All aspects are well-built, in the diplomacy side, tactical combat, or even with their city management. In fact, you can even leverage this very AI and automate your own cities to automate production and expansion.\r\nWinning is only the beginning\r\nThe winning conditions are defined by the player, either by military where you need to defeat all factions; expansion where you need to take over a huge portion of the map; magical prowess – which is basically researching enough tech and completing the objectives; or achieving the highest score when the game's predefined turn limit ends. Every condition caters to a certain playstyle and benefits players of all types.\r\nAfter you win, the game is still not done, as Age of Wonders 4 offers a post-game skill tree that is designed to keep players invested in their overall time with the game with the ability to affect subsequent playthroughs one after the other. Offering players to unlock and discover new ways to play.\r\nAs a first time experience, the whole learning curve is very accessible. Even though Age of Wonders 4 is extremely complex and has many different layers to it, the tutorials are nicely done and enhance the whole initial starting experience instead of annoyingly interrupting the player. It also helps that the game is straightforward when it comes to the logic behind the resources, diplomacy, and warfare. Players also benefit from the super detailed in-game tooltips complete with hoverable words that can display an additional tooltip to explain that word, again and again, Talk about tool-tip-ception.\r\nMy only minor gripe comes from the selection of units, units on top of hex tiles and provinces can be hard to click sometimes. Speaking of game controls, while Age of Wonders 4 is optimally designed with keyboard and mouse (as with all strategy games), the game also properly supports controllers with the right UI elements baked in. Even the manner of how you select units and UI navigation are all integrated.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5335749) Originally posted on TapTap.",

You can basically interact with and inspect most of the environment and objects, while roaming freely across the land in a rotatable top-down view of the world around you. The game features voxel based graphics with low-poly aesthetics predominantly noticeable on the characters, while the environments around him are more modern looking and have decent lighting effects.\r\nThe player can only strictly move in four directions, meaning there are no diagonal movements or full 360 degrees of movement, which can be a bit jarring for new players especially those not used to this style. You can use the WASD to move, or use mouse clicks to anywhere near the character or the mini-map to move to that specific location automatically with decent pathing.\r\nThen I was tasked to kill some Rats and that’s where I saw some minor combat action. The tutorial and the overall dialogue system is a bit long-winded and clunky to interact with, but aside from that, the new player experience does a pretty decent job of introducing the game to the player without overwhelming him with too much information.\r\nThe game then proceeds to offer me quest after quest, providing a guided exploration experience across the land while gradually introducing mechanics such as repairs, crafting, and healing.\r\nThe world layout is fairly typical for an MMORPG, including towns, treacherous countryside brimming with unusual dangers such as oversized spiders or rats, as well as roaming NPCs, dungeons, forests, roads, and more. However, in line with the game's hardcore feel, the pacing is slow overall. Movement is sluggish, combat feels lethargic, and interacting with the environment can be a bit tedious.\r\nThe game itself shows signs of promise — especially those who like the old-school aesthetic — but it's filled with design issues, bugs, and general clunkiness that it hurts the overall experience.\r\nThe dialogue system is clunky and very unresponsive when being interacted with. Some quests are broken, especially when you accidentally stumble upon things in advance by randomly exploring, before than the developers intended.\r\nIn many instances, the world around you won’t load properly and I found myself bumping a lot with invisible elements that haven’t loaded yet. World elements such as walls, bridges, and houses will render very late. Items will constantly despawn, duplicate, and get lost for some reason. The performance, for its low poly visuals, isn’t even able to achieve a smooth 60fps performance even for a high end GPU (RTX 3080).\r\nThere are many classes and subclasses to choose from, including fighters, protectors, archers, rogues, arcanists, and mystics. Perhaps more than the usual offering in MMORPGs, especially new ones. Each class offers widely varying opportunities for playstyles and approaches to combat, giving players the opportunity to customize their gameplay experience to their liking. The class names are very straightforward and easy to understand.\r\nThe fighters' subclasses seem to offer different approaches to combat, such as the berserker's aggressive playstyle or the spellblade's mix of melee and magic. The protectors' subclasses, on the other hand, seem to focus more on defensive playstyles, with the guardian and earthguard providing different approaches to tanking.\r\nThe archers' subclasses offer different approaches to ranged combat, with the hunter and ranger offering different specializations in the use of bows and arrows. The rogues' subclasses offer different approaches to stealth and melee combat, with the assassin and shadowblade providing different approaches to dealing high damage.\r\nThe arcanists' subclasses provide different approaches to magic, with the elementalists focusing on manipulating the elements and the shadowcaster using dark magic and illusions. Lastly, the mystics' subclasses offer different approaches to support roles, with the enchanter focusing on crowd control and buffing allies and the priest providing healing and protective spells.\r\nAs for the potential costs of playing the game, Ethyrial: Echoes of Yore is going to cost around $10/month to access the entirety of the content, while the free-to-play option only gives access to the first two areas, including the tutorial area, which amounts to around 10 to 20 hours of gameplay.\r\nWhile a lifetime (of the game only, not the player) subscription fee of $300 is available as an option, it may not be worth considering due to the current state of the game. The game launched a week ago plagued with problems even outside the game with purchases and server issues, and is planned to be 'relaunched' come May 12th, with the servers getting a full wipe.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5349540) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Shapeshifting Detective\r\nThe Shapeshifting Detective is an intriguing murder mystery FMV game  developed by D'Avekki Studios and released for PC, Playstation, Xbox One and Switch, and was ported right after to iOS.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Random killer every playthrough\r\n- Shapeshifting ability is a literal game changer for interacting with the characters\r\n-  Each character has their own intertwined backstory, motivations, alibis, and suspicious mannerisms\r\n- Interesting story from start to end## Cons\r\n-Lacking the usual ‘detective’ game elements\r\n-The Shapeshifting element is not used to its fullest potential\r\n-Short at around 3-4 hours\r\nThe Shapeshifting Detective is set in a small, remote town called August, where a murder has taken place in the local hotel called the “Guesthouse”. Players take on the role of a detective who is tasked with solving the murder by using their shape-shifting ability — only known by the higher-ups and not by any of the characters in the town — to gather information and interact with the game's cast of characters. This allows for interesting interactions between characters and easy access to information that would otherwise be unobtainable with a regular Detective.\r\nSince The Shapeshifting Detective is an FMV game, the entire gameplay experience consists of live-action scenes that encompass all the game's sequences, including the various choices, interviews, interactions, and outcomes that the player can take. According to the developer, it features over 1600 full HD video sequences.\r\nThese video sequences in the game are fairly acted and are well written. It seems extremely campy at first, with the characters being a hit or a miss with their initial acting prowess and weird facial expressions looking at the camera (you), but in general, you get used to it and the overall experience of the game is a blast as far as the storytelling is concerned.\r\nOne of the features that makes The Shapeshifting Detective a standout is the randomly chosen murderer at the start of the game. Making it a highly replayable game and keeps it mysterious, even after multiple tries. Each character has their own intertwined backstories, motivations, alibis, and suspicious mannerisms, which makes the crime solving all the more interesting and the murderer’s identity hard to uncover.\r\nThe writing is also well-paced, with the story gradually unfolding as the player progresses through the game divided into chapters. The dialogue is witty and sometimes humorous, but the actual tone and presentation of the game feels like a horror one, which helps to keep the player engaged and invested in the story. It never really had dull moments and I was continually interested throughout the whole experience. Having said that, the game’s premise can sometimes require some heavy suspension of disbelief, especially with how supernatural abilities are handled in the story, and how your shapeshifting powers are so out of place with regards to the seemingly normal setting of the game.\r\nThroughout the game, the player — while hidden in their room — can shapeshift between the different characters they meet, each with their own unique personalities and secrets. It's up to the player to gather as much information as possible from each character in order to piece together the events leading up to the murder and find the culprit.\r\nThis shapeshifting ability is a literal game changer in interacting with the characters. For example, a character might need permission from his superior to divulge specific information. Well you can shapeshift into his superior to give that needed approval; or you can pose as another character’s love interest or close friend, to get much more intimate and private information than usual.\r\nDespite the player taking on the role of a “Detective”, the crime solving element is probably the weakest part of the game. The player doesn’t really do any typical crime solving tasks, except for interviewing the characters and posing as another to get more information. That means there’s no crime scene or fingerprint analysis, physical evidence gathering, stalking characters, searching rooms, or even an avenue to take notes in the game to piece together gathered information. Fortunately, your superior chief of police can recap a summary of everything you’ve gathered so far.\r\nThe Shapeshifting Detective also emphasized not getting caught while shapeshifting as a plot point at the start of the game, but it never really gets you into situations where you can get caught, and just wastes that potential gameplay element entirely. Also, while the game gives you the possibility of talking to any character while posing as another character, you can never really do that fully and the game just does a cheap job at managing its possible interactions by hand waving the characters out of existence depending on which character you shapeshift into, while still making that option unnecessarily available to select anyway. Shapeshift into the chief of police and visit a character? Suddenly this character is out and you’re shown an empty room.\r\nDespite these minor shortcomings, The Shapeshifting Detective is a fun FMV-game to experience, perhaps even one of the most unique examples to try in recent years. Its premise of having a detective which can shapeshift into different characters is a standout feature, providing a rewarding and unexpected source of shapeshifting satisfaction. Overall, the game is short and is easily beatable in around three to four hours of play, however the game’s replayability with the random murderer at the start can help extend this value.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5375160) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Developed by Playdead that was first released in 2010. It has since been ported to various platforms, such as iOS back in 2021.\r\n## Pros\r\n- minimalistic platformer gameplay experience.\r\n- depressing monochromatic visuals\r\n- haunting soundtrack equally as depressing as the visuals## Cons\r\n-controls is hard to control sometimes\r\nLIMBO+ is the Apple Arcade version of LIMBO and was released for it recently this year, offering players an immersive, depressing, and challenging minimalistic experience.\r\nLIMBO features monochromatic visuals and a haunting soundtrack that creates a sense of unease and tension throughout the game. The minimalist, mostly dark graphics are designed to evoke a sense of ambiguity, leaving players unsure of what exactly they're seeing or what's happening around them.\r\nThe depressingly dark visuals are also utilized in the game's puzzles, which often require players to use shadows and silhouettes to solve them. The game's atmosphere is just amazing and gives its game its dark personality and theme.\r\nThe gameplay mechanics in LIMBO+ are relatively simple, yet challenging. When purely describing the game mechanics, you could mistake this for a kids game, but the depressing visuals say otherwise. The player controls a young boy as he navigates through various environmental obstacles and hazards, ranging from traps and pitfalls to hostile creatures.\r\nThe player must solve puzzles and use the environment to their advantage to progress through the game. The puzzles are well-designed and often require a bit of creative thinking to solve. The game does not hold your hand and just puts you right into the game, there are no tutorials or even story or logical explanations given for the varying puzzles throughout the game, adding to the sense of mystery and discovery.\r\nAs someone who is not a fan of jump-scares, what I love about LIMBO is its ability to create tension, scare, and danger without relying on jump scares or gruesomeness. The game's visual and audio design work together to create an atmosphere that is both eerie and immersive.\r\nThe subtle use of sound effects, such as creaking boards or the distant sounds of machinery, adds to the game's sense of unease. The game's puzzles are also used to create a sense of danger, with some puzzles requiring quick reflexes and split-second decision-making, usually leaving many players dead before they can react, and taking a few tries to properly pull it off.\r\nThe game's story is minimalist, with no dialogue or text used to explain the plot. Instead, the game relies on visual storytelling to convey its narrative, and it works for what it is trying to do. The player takes on the role of a young boy searching for his sister in a dangerous and mysterious world.\r\nExcept for the title “LIMBO”, The game's story is left intentionally vague, allowing players to draw their conclusions and interpretations of what's happening. (In fact there are lots of story theories going around on the internet). This approach is refreshing in a medium where games have defined and distinct stories, and the storytelling method is spoon fed to the players.\r\nThe game's length is relatively short, taking around four hours to complete. However, the game is mesmerizing enough and the puzzles challenging enough to make replaying the game an unsurprising decision.\r\nMy only gripe with this game is that the game is a little bit harder to understand and control with the transition from physical controllers on the consoles to touchscreen devices. While nothing is exceedingly hard to get, the game can sometimes feel unresponsive, and the lack of precision can be frustrating, especially during puzzle-solving sequences that require quick reflexes. However, this issue is relatively minor and does not detract significantly from the overall experience.\r\nIn conclusion, LIMBO+ is an excellent game that manages to create a strong sense of unease and tension in such a simple gameplay and visual format. The game's visuals, sound design, and puzzle mechanics work together to create a unique and immersive experience that is sure to stick with players long after they've completed it. While the game's controls can be frustrating at times, this is a minor issue that does not significantly detract from the game's overall quality. If you're a fan of puzzle-platformer games and you’ve somehow missed this gem of a game, it’s the perfect opportunity to play it now.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5376417) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Shapeshifting Detective\r\n9.3\r\nAdventure\r\nRPG\r\nThe Shapeshifting Detective is set in a small, remote town called August, where a murder has taken place in the local hotel called the “Guesthouse”. Players take on the role of a detective who is tasked with solving the murder by using their shape-shifting ability — only known by the higher-ups and not by any of the characters in the town — to gather information and interact with the game's cast of characters. This allows for interesting interactions between characters and easy access to information that would otherwise be unobtainable with a regular Detective.\r\nOne of the features that makes The Shapeshifting Detective a standout is the randomly chosen murderer at the start of the game. Making it a highly replayable game and keeps it mysterious, even after multiple tries. Each character has their own intertwined backstories, motivations, alibis, and suspicious mannerisms, which makes the crime solving all the more interesting and the murderer’s identity hard to uncover.\r\nThe writing is also well-paced, with the story gradually unfolding as the player progresses through the game divided into chapters. The dialogue is witty and sometimes humorous, but the actual tone and presentation of the game feels like a horror one, which helps to keep the player engaged and invested in the story.\r\nThroughout the game, players — while hidden in their room — can shapeshift between the different characters they meet, each with their own unique personalities and secrets. It's up to the player to gather as much information as possible from each character in order to piece together the events leading up to the murder and find the culprit.\r\nDespite the player taking on the role as a “Detective”, the crime solving element is probably the weakest part of the game. The player doesn’t really do any typical crime solving task, except for interviewing the characters and posing as another to get more information. That means there’s no crime scene or fingerprint analysis, physical evidence gathering, stalking characters, or even an avenue to take notes in the game to piece together gathered information. Fortunately, your superior chief of police can recap a summary of everything you’ve gathered so far.\r\nDespite these minor shortcomings, The Shapeshifting Detective is a fun FMV-game to experience, perhaps even the best example to try in recent years. Its premise of having a detective which can shapeshift into different characters is a standout feature, providing a rewarding and unexpected source of shapeshifting satisfaction. Overall, the game is short and is easily beatable in around three to four hours of play, however the game’s replayability with the random murderer at the start can help extend this value.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5375057) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players can customize their characters, upgrade their defenses, and even tame wild animals to help them in battle. Kingdom Two Crowns+ is the Apple Arcade version that was recently released for the subscription service.\r\nThe game's premise is simple: players take on the role of a monarch tasked with building and defending a kingdom from enemy attacks. Players can only move left or right on a 2D pixel world. There is a main underlying resource which is the gold coins, which is used to basically do almost all actions in the world. Players must explore the world, gather resources, and recruit new citizens to help them in their quest. Along the way, they must also build and upgrade their defenses to fend off increasingly powerful waves of enemies, and slowly expand their territory.\r\nWhile the player is building his Kingdom, he can also roam around the 2D side scrolling island and encounter many gameplay features like ruins, wild beasts, gold or gem chests, and enemy portals to cleanse and capture. The player can also build a ship and travel to another faraway island with the promise of obtaining higher tier technologies and continue building a kingdom there.\r\nOne of the key gameplay mechanics in Kingdom Two Crowns+ is the management of resources. Players must carefully balance their spending and investment of gold coins to ensure they have enough resources to build and upgrade their defenses while also having enough coins to perform other actions such as upgrading the town hall and other structures, or recruiting more people.\r\nKingdom Two Crowns+ also offers the ability to assign citizens to different types of roles to help in the development of the kingdom. Each role has its own unique abilities and strengths, and players must strategically choose which ones to recruit and when to use them. For example, players can choose to create builder units to help build the kingdom more effectively, or they may choose archers or pikemen to serve as hunters and soldiers, each of whom has different strengths and weaknesses such as range and damage.\r\nThe game also includes a split-screen co-op mode, which allows players to team up with a friend to take on the challenges together, with both players controlling each side of the touchscreen, or an optional physical controller connected over bluetooth. This adds an entirely new dimension to the gameplay, as players must work together to coordinate their defenses and manage resources effectively. The co-op mode is seamless and easy to jump into anytime in the game’s settings, and easy to turn off once the session is complete, making it a great option for players who prefer to play with friends.\r\nWhile it did release on PC and consoles first, Kingdom Two Crowns+' simple controls, mechanics, and pixel art are a perfect match for providing a fun mobile game experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5384953) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players must build a base, gather resources, and train troops to defeat their enemies. Iron Marines also has hero units that can be upgraded and customized to suit the player's playstyle.\r\nPlayers can choose from a roster of different heroes, each with their own unique abilities and playstyle. For example, some heroes are designed for long-range combat, while others excel in close-quarters combat. Each hero can be customized with different weapons and upgrades, allowing players to tailor their playstyle to their preferences. You start off with one hero, and unlock more as you finish more stages.\r\nIn addition to the hero units, Iron Marines+ features a wide range of different troops, vehicles, and supports that players can use to defeat their enemies. From basic infantry units to heavily armored tanks and aircraft, there is a unit for every situation in Iron Marines. Players must carefully manage their resources to build the right mix of units to tackle each level's challenges. Some units can easily switch between other similar types while in the battlefield, providing for some nice tactical layers not seen in other games.\r\nThe gameplay in Iron Marines+ is fast-paced and challenging. Each level, and eventually, planet, presents players with a new set of objectives, ranging from simple base-building tasks to full-on battles against alien forces. The game does an excellent job of gradually ramping up the difficulty, introducing new enemies and challenges as players progress through the campaign that spans multiple stages and planets.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5379551) Originally posted on TapTap.",

As players progress through the game, the puzzles become increasingly difficult, and it can be quite satisfying to figure out a particularly challenging puzzle, especially the timed ones or ones where you need to avoid enemies or detection.\r\nVery Little Nightmares+ is simply artistically stunning. The game features a unique art style that mostly incorporates hard drawn visuals creating a surreal and unsettling atmosphere that predominantly uses dark and shadows. This art style is in heavy contrast with the original game’s 3D side-scrolling look. The game's environments are grainy, detailed and atmospheric, with each level having its own unique look, color tone, and feel.\r\nThe character designs in Very Little Nightmares+ also fits the somewhat lighthearted but still eerie atmosphere of the game. The main character, along with friendlies encountered are lightheartedly designed, while the game’s enemies are made to look both creepy, scary, and intriguing. The movements are fluid and well-animated and it feels like you’re watching a creepy cartoon series late at night.\r\nThe sound in Very Little Nightmares+ totally fits the creepy atmosphere of the game. The game's music is haunting and atmospheric, and it does an excellent job of setting the mood for each level. The eerie sound effects help immerse the player in the game's world.\r\nThere is no dialogue, and the whole game is told via the characters' muted actions and journey throughout the levels.

The game sometimes has trouble differentiating between single and double taps, and occasionally you might tap in the wrong location. This can confuse the character's pathfinding AI and potentially lead to failure.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5381463) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players can customize their characters, upgrade their defenses, and even tame wild animals to help them in battle. Kingdom Two Crowns+ is the Apple Arcade version that was recently released for the subscription service.\r\nKingdom Two Crowns+ is a unique experience that blends 2D side scrollers, strategy, exploration, and resource management into a beautiful and challenging pixelated experience. Developed by Noio and Coatsink, this game is a sequel to the popular Kingdom series and builds upon the gameplay mechanics of its predecessors while adding new features and improvements.\r\nThe game's premise is simple: players take on the role of a monarch tasked with building and defending a kingdom from enemy attacks. Players can only move left or right on a 2D pixel world. There is a main underlying resource which is the gold coins, which is used to basically do almost all actions in the world. Players must explore the world, gather resources, and recruit new citizens to help them in their quest. Along the way, they must also build and upgrade their defenses to fend off increasingly powerful waves of enemies, and slowly expand their territory.\r\nThe town hall is the main structure that the player can upgrade and defines the current tier level of the Kingdom. Moving up tiers may require different technologies or characters to be discovered and recruited such as gathering stone and iron. The kingdom management aspect is very simple but totally addictive — just accumulating gold coins and occasionally gems to upgrade everything.\r\nWhile the player is building his Kingdom, he can also roam around the 2D side scrolling island and encounter many gameplay features like ruins, wild beasts, gold or gem chests, and enemy portals to cleanse and capture. The player can also build a ship and travel to another faraway island with the promise of obtaining higher tier technologies and continue building a kingdom there.\r\nKingdom Two Crowns+ features gorgeous pixel art visuals. The game world is rendered in stunning pixel art detail, with vibrant colors, immersive lighting, and intricate 8-bit animations that bring the world to life. The sound design is also excellent, with a calming soundtrack that perfectly complements the gameplay.\r\nOne of the key gameplay mechanics in Kingdom Two Crowns+ is the management of resources. Players must carefully balance their spending and investment of gold coins to ensure they have enough resources to build and upgrade their defenses while also having enough coins to perform other actions such as upgrading the town hall and other structures, or recruiting more people.\r\nThe gold coins also serve as the functional HP for the main character. Getting hit by enemies will cause the gold coins to drop until they are depleted, at which point the crown drops and the monarch dies if the crown is not retrieved. This creates a sense of tension as players must make difficult decisions about where to allocate their gold coins.\r\nKingdom Two Crowns+ also offers the ability to assign citizens to different types of roles to help in the development of the kingdom. Each role has its own unique abilities and strengths, and players must strategically choose which ones to recruit and when to use them. For example, players can choose to create builder units to help build the kingdom more effectively, or they may choose archers or pikemen to serve as hunters and soldiers, each of whom has different strengths and weaknesses such as range and damage.\r\nHowever, the game is not without its flaws. Some players may find the gameplay to be too repetitive or slow-paced, especially when you already have a big kingdom spanning a wide amount of land to cover. I find the back and forth-ing around the kingdom can be tedious. Additionally, the game's difficulty can be unforgiving at times, with the player character having no option to properly do combat and have to rely on his citizens, and the enemies becoming increasingly powerful and difficult to defeat as players progress through the game.\r\nThe game also includes a split-screen co-op mode, which allows players to team up with a friend to take on the challenges together, with both players controlling each side of the touchscreen, or an optional physical controller connected over bluetooth. This adds an entirely new dimension to the gameplay, as players must work together to coordinate their defenses and manage resources effectively. The co-op mode is seamless and easy to jump into anytime in the game’s settings, and easy to turn off once the session is complete, making it a great option for players who prefer to play with friends.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5385048) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Is an absurd “racing” game featuring an ever evolving race car that is just about everything you could think of except being an actual car.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fun engaging racing game with hundreds of unique levels\r\n- Different car mechanics for every episode and chapters\r\n- Full of car-centric quips, jokes, and a humorous soundtrack to boot\r\n- Level editor## Cons\r\n-No ‘wheel-to-wheel’ real racing\r\nIn WHAT THE CAR?, you control a car with two human feet, and participate in various races that evolve the car even further and in various ridiculous ways. Grow additional legs, grow springs around it to bounce around, strapped with jetpacks, ultra spaghetti legs, spider-legs, slinky cars, just about everything you could think of except being an actual car.  It is a recently released Apple Arcade exclusive, and can only be played on iOS by Apple Arcade subscribers.\r\nWHAT THE CAR? Features hundreds of unique levels  where you race around the tracks by jumping, flying with jetpacks, bouncing around with springs and boosts, climbing buildings, and many more absurdities that the developers have come up with. These absurd levels are fun, engaging, and satisfying to play in to. Some levels are more challenging and sometimes even frustrating than others, but it helps that the game isn’t really taking itself too seriously.\r\nThe controls are simple, players control the car with the on-screen steering wheel and a button on the right side to activate an ever changing ability. This ability depends on the current “mode” of the car, which is determined by the current episode, or chapter that you select. It can be as simple as accelerating or moving the legs forward, or as complex as activating its jetpacks with limited fuel.\r\nIt’s not only fun, but also funny, featuring a quirky game full of car-centric quips, jokes, and a humorous soundtrack and effects that only makes the game more fun and charming. The game does not take itself seriously and doubles down on the absurdness, just embracing pure insanity.\r\nThe levels are mostly in a time-attack race setup where you are actually just timed and don't race against other AI or human players so there's not much direct competition involved in the game. Still, I wish that there is an option for wheel-to-wheel real racing multiplayer especially with how absurdly fun the gameplay concept is.\r\nEach race is scored by time and gives players bronze, silver, or gold trophies depending on how quickly players finish. There are optional collectible cards on each level to give some players an additional challenge aside from racing against time.\r\nIt’s not a full-on racing game, as WHAT THE CAR? features platforming elements on both the races as well as featuring an overworld segment that effectively functions as the game menu, where you can roam around the different islands and select races to participate in. The same simplistic control scheme is present in this overworld setup, but at a much slower pace and a zoomed out view.\r\nAnd if the hundreds of unique levels isn’t enough, the game features a level editor in which player made levels are incorporated into the game and playable in the overworld in an asynchronous multiplayer setup. You can create and edit your own levels and publish them as well, giving players a true sandbox experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5386042) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Getting Over It+\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nGet\r\nGetting Over It+ is a physics-based platformer that will require your patience, dexterity, and problem solving skills… well mostly, your patience.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Highly addictive — up until you reach your limits to try again another day\r\n- Challenging platformer puzzles\r\n- With high difficulty comes a highly rewarding experience## Cons\r\n-Game is highly punishing and frustrating, clearly not for everyone\r\n-Frustrating control system by design\r\nThe original Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy was released back in 2017 and has now been recently released as Getting Over It+, as part of the Apple Arcade subscription.\r\nThe game, developed by Bennett Foddy, is a spiritual successor to his earlier games, \"QWOP\" and “GIRP”, which are flash-based games in the early 2010s you might have probably heard of,  and features a similar level of difficulty and frustration.\r\nThe premise of Getting Over It+ is simple: you control a man stuck in a cauldron who must climb a mountain using only a large hammer to propel himself. The controls are straightforward, but the gameplay is anything but. You move the hammer by swiping around the touchscreen, and you can use it to swing, push, or pull yourself up the mountain full of random objects that don't make any sense.\r\nIn fact, nothing makes any sense in Getting Over It+ aside from the ultimate goal of climbing up. There are no story elements, no cutscenes, or even any progression or combat system. It’s just purely a physics-based platformer that will test your patience and skills to its absolute limits.\r\nThe game is designed to be extremely challenging, and it is not for the faint of heart. The mountain is full of intentionally frustrating obstacles, such as steep cliffs, narrow ledges, and blockades, which require precise movements and timing to navigate. One misstep can send you tumbling back down to the bottom, and there are no checkpoints or save points to help you out, resetting your progress back to where you fell into --- which can by a LOT.\r\nThe controls are simple on paper and only require either hand, but very hard and highly fallible when it comes to actually climbing the mountain. You just move the hammer around your character in a 360 degree circle of varying degrees of reach, hitting the ground or any obstacle to push yourself against it; or you can cling or hook the hammer around higher elements to swing your character around.\r\nGetting Over It+ is probably the harder version compared to the PC release, as the transition to touch screen controls makes the game significantly harder to control due to the lack of precise input method like the mouse. There are some in-game options to help you like sensitivity and the acceleration, but it still doesn’t match the level of control that you get with a mouse pointer. However, with time and enough practice, the game is still highly playable and not impossible to control.\r\nThe difficulty of the game is what makes it so addictive — up until you reach your limits to try again another day. There is a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that comes with overcoming a particularly challenging section of the mountain. You will find yourself constantly pushing to reach the top, no matter how many times you fall. Especially if you start to master its physics-based mechanics.\r\nWhile Getting Over It+ is highly frustrating, the game is filled with witty commentary and humorous quips from the narrator, who is voiced by Bennett Foddy himself. His dry, sardonic tone is a welcome reprieve to the otherwise extremely punishing gameplay, and it helps to alleviate some of the frustration that comes with constantly falling. The narrator even encourages you to stop playing and try again next time, recites various motivational quotes to you, and even plays relaxing music on top of the already relaxing background lounge music to help you manage your irritation.\r\nAs narrated by Bennett Foddy, the game’s mountain-climbing gameplay serves as a metaphor for life’s challenges and the struggles we all face. The game’s protagonist, a man trapped in a cauldron, serves as a symbol for the obstacles we must overcome in our own lives, and the mountain itself represents the journey we all take towards self-improvement and personal growth. It suddenly becomes a very deep game, with thought-provoking effects that can affect the player long after they’re done playing with it.\r\nThe mountain you must climb is treacherous, with obstacles that seem almost impossible to surmount. Every time you just beat a difficult challenge, another one will test your skills even further and it’s a testament to the game’s design that it never feels unfair, because it definitely feels doable and within reach.\r\nWhile the game is simply in 2D view and the premise of a man stuck in a cauldron with superstrength to even use a hammer to move himself is definitely nonsensical, the game’s physics engine is incredibly well-designed with realistic physics that make each maneuver feel weighty and realistic, It clings to the mountain, its rocks, and objects alike very satisfyingly well.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5377545) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game is set in a distant future where humanity has spread throughout the galaxy and established colonies on various planets.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fun RTS game at its core\r\n- Different hero types to choose from\r\n- Built specifically for touchscreen devices\r\n- Unique levels visual and challenge wise## Cons\r\n-Touchscreen controls aren’t perfect\r\nIron Marines is a real time strategy game released for mobile devices originally back in 2017, and has since been ported to PC, and then recently released as Iron Marines+, a version of the game that is exclusive to Apple Arcade, a subscription-based gaming service offered by Apple.\r\nIn Iron Marines+, players take on the role of the titular Iron Marines, an elite group of soldiers tasked with defending humanity from various threats. The premise and setup is clearly inspired by Starcraft. The unit and building aesthetics, the enemies, and the whole gameplay setup will remind you of Starcraft, but cartoon-ized and made lighthearted. It also was built with touch controls in mind.\r\nAt its core, Iron Marines+ is a classic real-time strategy game that will feel familiar to fans of the genre. Players must build a base, gather resources, and train troops to defeat their enemies. Iron Marines+ also has hero units that can be upgraded and customized to suit the player's playstyle.\r\nPlayers can choose from a roster of different heroes, each with their own unique abilities and playstyle. For example, some heroes are designed for long-range combat, while others excel in close-quarters combat. Each hero can be customized with different weapons and upgrades, allowing players to tailor their playstyle to their preferences. You start off with one hero, and unlock more as you finish more stages.\r\nThe hero units in Iron Marines+ are not just powerful combat units; they also serve as the player's avatar within the game and the leader of the army deployed to the battle. Each hero has their own unique backstory and personality, and they provide a sense of connection to the game world and add an additional flavor to an otherwise stale story.\r\nIn addition to the hero units, Iron Marines+ features a wide range of different troops, vehicles, and supports that players can use to defeat their enemies. From basic infantry units to heavily armored tanks and aircraft, there is a unit for every situation in Iron Marines. Players must carefully manage their resources to build the right mix of units to tackle each level's challenges. Some units can easily switch between other similar types while in the battlefield, providing for some nice tactical layers not seen in other games.\r\nThe gameplay in Iron Marines+ is fast-paced and challenging. Each level, and eventually, planet, presents players with a new set of objectives, ranging from simple base-building tasks to full-on battles against alien forces. The game does an excellent job of gradually ramping up the difficulty, introducing new enemies and challenges as players progress through the campaign that spans multiple stages and planets.\r\nEach level is fairly crafted, with a unique layout and set of challenges that requires players to use different strategies and tactics to succeed. Some levels feature large open areas where players must defend their base against waves of enemies, while others take place in cramped underground tunnels where players must carefully navigate their troops to avoid traps and ambushes.\r\nThe game features colorful, vibrant, and detailed environments; and the character models are full of charm and features cartoon-esque designs. The animations are smooth and fluid, and the 2D special effects are impressive, especially during large-scale battles with many units on screen.\r\nWhile the game's controls were built with touch controls in mind and generally works for the most part, it can be a bit clunky at times, especially on smaller phone screens. Some players may find it difficult to select individual units or issue specific commands during large battles.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5379579) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The adventurer must endlessly run through the temple, avoiding obstacles, collecting coins, and trying to outrun a group of demonic monkeys chasing after them.\r\nTemple Run+ is the Apple Arcade version of the game, which was released for the subscription-based gaming service offered by Apple just recently.\r\nThe game is easy to pick up and play, with simple four directional swipes and tilt (gyro) phone controls that allow the player to move left, right, jump, and slide. The game's objective is to run as far as possible, collecting coins along the way to purchase power-ups and upgrades that can help the player go further.\r\nThe player can either swipe left or right at the right time to follow the track’s direction and avoid failing, while they also need to swipe up and down at the right time to avoid obstacles such as jumping around pits, sliding down small gaps. Needless to say, this game requires great reflexes to be able to enjoy this game to the fullest.\r\nThe game's difficulty increases as the player progresses, with new obstacles and challenges introduced at each stage. The game's pacing is excellent, keeping players engaged and constantly on the edge of their seats, while giving them a satisfying feeling collecting coins and garnering points aiming for a new high score.

The game also features some minor visual effects with some unlockable power-ups using points gathered in runs, such as the blur effect when the adventurer runs at top speed or the slow-motion effect when the adventurer is caught by the monkeys.\r\nIt also plays like a rogue-lite of sorts, with each playthrough offering a new challenge and experience, especially if you spend gold to unlock new power ups and boosts like coins multiplier or a free revive. Players can try to beat their high score, beat their friends’ or even the global high score, or unlock new achievements and complete weekly challenges, giving plenty of reasons to get sucked back into the game despite the pretty endless monotonous gameplay.\r\nConclusion\r\nTemple Run+ is a classic mobile game that even if you’ve already played it years ago, it’s still worth revisiting. The game's monotonous yet challenging gameplay, ageless design, and simple controls make for an engaging and addictive experience that is hard to put down. Whether you're a fan of mindless “beat the high score” reaction-based games or just looking for a fun and entertaining game to play on your mobile device, Temple Run is definitely worth checking out.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5379936) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Grow additional legs, grow springs around it to bounce around, strapped with jetpacks, ultra spaghetti legs, spider-legs, slinky cars, just about everything you could think of except being an actual car.\r\nWHAT THE CAR? Features hundreds of unique levels and stages where you race around the tracks by jumping, flying with jetpacks, bouncing around with springs and boosts, climbing buildings, and many more absurdities that the developers have come up with. These absurd levels are fun, engaging, and satisfying to play in to. Some levels are more challenging and sometimes even frustrating than others, but it helps that the game isn’t really taking itself too seriously.\r\nThe levels are mostly in a time-attack race setup where you are actually just timed and don't race against other AI or human players so there's not much direct competition involved in the game. Each race is scored by time and gives you bronze, silver, or gold trophies depending on how quickly players finish. There are optional collectible cards on each level to give some players an additional challenge aside from the time.\r\nAnd if the hundreds of unique levels isn’t enough, the game features a level editor in which player made levels are incorporated into the game and playable in the overworld in an asynchronous multiplayer setup.

All four are playable and have different weapons, fighting styles, and starting abilities that players can freely choose and switch between them at the hideout, depending on their preferred playstyle.\r\nMichelangelo deals area damage with his nunchucks and prioritizes multiple low damage hits. Leonardo deals high damage with his dual swords and focuses on high mobility. Raphael has the shortest range of all with his twin sai, but deals heavy critical damage. While Donatello has the longest range with his bo staff and is focused on utility and durability.\r\nTMNT Splintered Fate features a story that involves Master Splinter being kidnapped by Shredder, as well as mysterious portals appearing everywhere across New York. The story feels like something we’ve already seen with the countless Ninja Turtles stories, and it is mostly just a fitting excuse to set up the rogue-lite action, which is the main highlight of the game.

All four characters start with a base ability called “tool”, but it can be upgraded, or even replaced entirely during runs.\r\nThis upgrade and randomized skill progression only persists during the run, and will be reset once the player fails. This in addition to the randomized room layouts and mini-bosses. This ensures that no run is the same, giving players a fresh experience every time they play.\r\nEvery once in a while, players will encounter a portal to the in-game shop, where you can trade “scrap” you’ve accumulated in that specific run in exchange for various temporary improvements, such as restoring health points, upgrades, or even new skills.\r\nAs part of being rogue-lite, progression persistence in this game comes in the form of Dragon and Dreamer Upgrades. Dragon and Dreamer Coins can be obtained by playing the game, and can be spent in between runs to improve the players’ stats, skills, and chances; such as increasing the number of dashes, free revives, health points, damage, luck, or currency obtained. Making sure that players can still make some progress despite resetting the run back to the start upon failure.\r\nTMNT Splintered Fate also features randomized mini-boss encounters that provide a decent amount of challenge, and can serve as warm ups for the more major boss fights featuring familiar characters such as Leatherhead and Oroku Karai. These major boss fights will also drop a unique item every time they are beaten, which is essential in furthering the persistent upgrade options presented to the player. This gives boss fights much more meaning and purpose. As well as incentivizes players to keep on doing runs and keep on defeating the bosses to get a better chance at upgrades.\r\nThe combat in this game is incredibly fluid and satisfying, especially considering that it is primarily controlled using touch screen inputs, which are usually considered an inferior control method for hack-and-slash games. The flashy yet fluid animations, subtle pauses during hits, visual and sound effects, and even the slow-motion effect when clearing a room all contribute to the game's amazing combat feel.\r\nAs for the graphics, the game features standard graphics that you'd typically find in a mobile game. It's not AAA level of quality, and just packs enough detail to make easy on the eyes, while keeping the focus on the fast-paced action and fluid gameplay.\r\nFor those who are highly familiar with the game mechanics of Hades, TMNT Splintered Fate is undoubtedly inspired by it and closely follows in its footsteps by featuring extremely similar game mechanics and formula. There is no shame in that as TMNT Splintered Fate is incredibly fun to play and can even rival Hades in terms of content and quality of gameplay.\r\nAs part of the Apple Arcade experience, the game also offers proper support for Bluetooth controllers, including Xbox and Playstation controllers, as well as offering a cooperative multiplayer option up to four players.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5388027) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game's use of fourth-wall breaking elements adds an extra layer of intrigue and keeps players on their toes, always expecting the unexpected.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Mind-bending twists and fourth wall breaks\r\n- Puzzles require heavy thinking outside the box\r\n- Lighthearted whimsical visuals## Cons\r\n-Short game\r\n-Heavily reuses scenes / locations\r\n-Feels like a demo of a larger game\r\nDetective Mimo is a charming and self-aware detective game that's perfect for fans of mystery and adventure games with a nice touch of fourth wall breaking. The game follows the titular detective cat Mimo as she solves crimes around town, and it's up to the player to help him piece together the clues and catch the culprit.\r\nThe visuals and presentation overall are lighthearted, whimsical, with hand painted art-style and charming music. The whole vibe feels like something that came out of a children's book. From time to time, the story is told in comic-books like moving panels and visual novel style dialogue between characters, but most of the time in this game is spent by solving puzzles and playing point-and-click detective.\r\nThe gameplay in Detective Mimo is a classic point-and-click adventure style in touch format, with players tapping on different areas of the screen to investigate crime scenes, gather and use objects, and solving puzzles. You can talk to some NPCs to give you some information and interact with the environment using a variety of novel ways not only involving the touch screen, but also involving many aspects of your mobile phones like using its gyro sensors, light detection, charging, and even gameplay elements literally outside the game.\r\nThe puzzles are challenging enough to be satisfying, but sometimes the logic used is so ridiculous and unrealistic that it requires heavy thinking out of the box, or just using brute force and trial and error. The logic still checks out though as the world is not our world but a weird world to begin with populated by anthropomorphic cats.\r\nThe game starts off in a usual classic adventure, with the player taking on the role of cat Mimo, who is a police detective. She is tasked to capture a notorious robber, a cat named ‘Cat Rogue’, Cat Rogue’ has announced his next heist and Mimo is sent to the Bank to investigate. The first hour or so functions like a normal classic adventure detective game, but suddenly shifts in tone towards a fourth-wall breaking, somewhat creepy game, and that kind of reminds me of Doki Doki Literature Club!, for those that are familiar.\r\nEventually, the game becomes self-aware, full of fourth wall breaks and genius ways of toying with the player. The puzzles become increasingly out of the box, and requires the players’ attention to detail not only to the in-world elements but also to the UI, menus, and even outside the game itself and inside your phone.\r\nThe experience is fun and constantly subverts the players’ expectations with regards to the gameplay and the plot. The actual puzzle gameplay which is the main highlight of the game, is challenging enough and gives players a varied number of unique puzzles to complete. As said earlier, it may require out of the box thinking. You may need to actually visit a website or two to progress in the game, or perhaps use your phones in ways you didn’t really expect. Of course, finding these things out and discovering them for yourself is part of the fun.\r\nUnfortunately, the game is too short, only clocking in about 3-4 hours of content even with the 2 endings and hidden segments. Scratching only the surface of what seems to be a demo for a much larger game that doesn’t exist. The game kind of sets us up for the whole city by showing us a map with different locations in it and the potential for a detective puzzle game that spans different locations. But it never really follows through with that element and instead just doubles down on the fourth-wall aspect, constantly reusing scenes or rooms as part of the gameplay and story instead of taking players to new areas and locations.\r\nThe game's self-awareness and fourth-wall breaking elements provide a unique and memorable experience that subverts players' expectations. While the game is on the short side, it is still a entertaining experience that will leave players wanting more.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5412542) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Detective Mimo\r\n9.4\r\nPuzzle\r\nSingleplayer\r\nDetective Mimo is a charming and self-aware detective game that's perfect for fans of mystery and adventure games with a nice touch of fourth wall breaking. The game follows the titular detective cat Mimo as she solves crimes around town, and it's up to the player to help him piece together the clues and catch the culprit.\r\nThe gameplay in Detective Mimo is a classic point-and-click adventure style in touch format, with players tapping on different areas of the screen to investigate crime scenes, gather and use objects, and solving puzzles. You can talk to some NPCs to give you some information and interact with the environment using a variety of novel ways not only involving the touch screen, but also involving many aspects of your mobile phones like using its gyro sensors, light detection, charging, and even gameplay elements literally outside the game.\r\nThe game starts off in a usual classic adventure, with the player taking on the role of cat Mimo, who is a police detective. She is tasked to capture a notorious robber, a cat named ‘Cat Rogue’, Cat Rogue’ has announced his next heist and Mimo is sent to the Bank to investigate. The first hour or so functions like a normal classic adventure detective game, but suddenly shifts in tone towards a fourth-wall breaking, somewhat creepy game, and that kind of reminds me of Doki Doki Literature Club!, for those that are familiar.\r\nThe experience is fun and constantly subverts the players’ expectations with regards to the gameplay and the plot. The actual puzzle gameplay which is the main highlight of the game, is challenging enough and gives players a varied number of unique puzzles to complete. As said earlier, it may require out of the box thinking. You may need to actually visit a website or two to progress in the game, or perhaps use your phones in ways you didn’t really expect. Of course, finding these things out and discovering them for yourself is part of the fun.\r\nOverall, Detective Mimo is a point-and-click detective game that challenges traditional forms of storytelling and invites the players to participate in the narrative in a unique and memorable way. It's a great choice for fans of mystery games, adventure games, or just anyone who wants to help a lovable cat detective solve crimes, sprinkled with some mind-bending twists.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5412497) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Reminiscent of games like Hytale and Minecraft (but in third person). For the purpose of this article, I played the mobile version open beta.\r\nThe game starts off by allowing the player to create their own character and naming it themselves. The premise of the game is reminiscent of a typical Isekai story, where the player wakes up in an outpost as the hero chosen by the Tree of Life to save the world. The player is aided by the somewhat rude Witch Sakura, who teaches the player survival skills and helps them embark on an adventure to retrieve the Seed of World, which is needed to sustain and save the dying Tree of Life.\r\nImmediately from the start, what I noticed about Dragon and Home was its clean smooth graphics. For a game with Minecraft-style blocky graphics, the graphics are actually quite impressive. The lighting is well done, with even motion blur and smooth anti-aliasing baked in, which I suspect is thanks in part to the Unreal Engine powering it. I was able to play the game on my 2018 flagship phone without any performance issues, which was a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack also exceeded my expectations, with its fantasy classical/upbeat tones, and I found it to be more catchy than I anticipated. The voice-acting, while sounding a little bit kid-friendly is actually decent.\r\nThe gameplay starts off by teaching the player the ropes, including how to gather resources, survive, and craft items like Pickaxes and axes to chop down trees and rocks for resources. The player is also taught how to hunt and combat various animals for food and additional resources. Pretty typical mechanics for a crafting/survival game, but slowly being infused with MMORPG mechanics.\r\nThe first few hours of gameplay are dedicated to learning the ropes and focusing on crafting and survival, which can be a bit slow and unenergetic. The game lacks action in the early stages, and the new player experience could benefit from more excitement to captivate players.\r\nThe game features three classes, which are the typical archer, mage, and warrior classes. The maximum level is only 20, but from what I've learned and experienced about this game so far, this game is grindy all the way through, with heavy focus on endless crafting and farming. Microtransactions are available at a certain level, which can heavily impede the player's progress.\r\nMost of the fun is gated and geared towards the higher levels, and the first couple of levels can be rather boring. As for the three classes: The warrior class focuses on tanking, gear, and defense, while the archer class focuses on DPS and making the game primarily a shooter. The mage class provides early game action and a variety of spells to use, although spells can take time to cast\r\nOne of my main gripes with the game was the controls. The position of the on-screen left stick can be quite frustrating, as it is strictly on the tiny part of the left side of the screen, causing me to accidentally move the camera quite frequently. The controls need more refining, especially with the position and behavior of the on-screen left stick, which needs to be configurable.\r\nDragon and Home’s crafting elements, Minecraft-style graphics, and MMORPG gameplay creates a lighthearted and kid friendly gaming experience. The game offers a lot of content, with a heavy focus on crafting and farming, and players can expect to sink many hours into the game if they enjoy these types of activities. The graphics and soundtrack are both above expectations, and the game runs smoothly on most mobile devices if I'm judging by its performance on my old android phone.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5415848) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This game immerses players in the rich lore of the Lord of the Rings universe, allowing them to command a party of iconic characters and embark on epic campaigns.\r\nLOTR Heroes of Middle Earth combines hero collection and turn-based combat mechanics to create a familiar gaming experience. The game follows various campaigns inspired by the LOTR storyline, giving players somewhat in charge of their journey and battles. The main campaign, known as the Light campaign, begins with Frodo's adventure alongside Strider (Aragorn). However, as players progress and collect more heroes, they have the freedom to customize their lineup, even replacing Frodo and Strider themselves.\r\nLOTR Heroes of Middle Earth is a hero collecting game at its core with a focus on participating in turn-based combat to progress in the levels called missions taking place in the lord of the rings storyline. The story is not exactly friendly for Lord of the Rings newcomers, as the game assumes some prior knowledge of the franchise, and newcomers may find it challenging to fully grasp the context and significance of certain characters, locations, and events.\r\nThe game seamlessly integrates the mobile gameplay into the LOTR books' narrative, albeit with some creative liberties. While the explanation of how players can influence the characters' actions and \"cleanse the corruption out of stories\" may require a suspension of belief, the addition of countless battles and scenes adds depth to the storyline.\r\nThe game's chapters present the storyline in a chapter-ized format commonly seen in live service RPG mobile games. It also allows players to freely change their party lineup between battles. Additionally, players can select up to five characters for battle, with the occasional sixth character being either a storyline NPC or another guild members’ character providing assistance.\r\nIn the early stages of the game, players are generously rewarded with resources and energy through various introductory quests, objectives, and challenges. These rewards enable players to unlock up to four characters quickly. Additional resources can be earned by playing the game, particularly EXP, which determines the maximum level of characters.\r\nThe progression system is designed to be intuitive and beginner-friendly, guiding players on which gear or resources to acquire for upgrades. Although unlocking characters may require some grinding, the game offers a degree of control over character progression, reducing reliance on randomization.\r\nLOTR Heroes of Middle Earth features stylized graphics that bring the characters and environments to life. The visual presentation is a unique adaptation of the LOTR mythos, displaying top-tier mobile AAA quality graphics unsurprisingly with EA behind the production of the game. The soundtrack is a decent orchestral high fantasy style, but nothing special unfortunately, they weren’t able to tap into the already amazing soundtrack from the live-action trilogy.\r\nThe gameplay in LOTR Heroes of Middle Earth revolves around two main components: turn-based combat and the RPG hero collecting aspect. Progression through the chapters entails engaging in turn-based battles, each contributing to the completion of the storyline. The game offers hundreds of engaging challenges for players to conquer.\r\nThese missions are rated based on a three-star system, evaluating the player's performance and is repeatable. Apart from the Light Campaign, there is also a Shadow campaign featuring different sets of \"Shadow\" Heroes to collect, providing an entirely separate storyline that players can progress in side by side with the Light campaign.\r\nThe turn-based combat is your standard combat system, with each of the characters having access to various unique skills such as AOE attacks, heals, buffs or debuffs. These skills can be upgraded along with the character. The overall combat is not really that deep, without any unique mechanics or items to use. Fortunately, players who aren’t interested can speed these battles up to x3 and use the auto function to allow the AI to take control.\r\nAs players progress through the game after the first few chapters, the difficulty level will steeply increase. This shift in difficulty can pose a challenge for newcomers who may have initially found the game to be relatively easy and guided. To overcome the rising difficulty, players will need to focus on upgrading their characters and obtaining new ones.\r\nMonitoring available upgrades and gear becomes crucial to ensure that characters are adequately equipped to tackle tougher missions and enemies. This emphasizes the importance of strategic character progression and team composition, as well as putting pressure on the players to spend real money.\r\nThe hero collecting aspect of the game allows players to summon various heroes to their aid, unlocking them as they meet specific requirements. Players can enhance their characters' stats by equipping them with gear obtained through looting or crafting. This upgrade system is user-friendly, guiding players on the necessary steps — what gear or resource to acquire and where — to improve their characters. Characters can also synergize with each other depending on their relationships in the story, such as with Frodo and the other Hobbits for example.\r\nWhile the game includes a gacha element when opening chests to obtain more characters, it is not the sole method of acquiring heroes. Players have a significant degree of control over character progression and are not solely reliant on randomization.\r\nGrinding in LOTR Heroes of Middle Earth has been streamlined into a much commendable simpler process, instead of continuously repeating a mission manually, you can “auto-battle” an already three-starred mission multiple times (up to x20 at a time), to effectively speedup progression and gain rewards. Provided that you have enough energy currency.\r\nWhile there is an auto function and x3 speed to help players automate battles like an idle game, the auto-battle is a much better option for those who want to grind repeatedly, and in an instant.\r\nAs LOTR Heroes of Middle Earth is a live service free-to-play game, there is unfortunately an understandable time currency in place to limit playtime. You need energy to take on missions and this energy will run out pretty fast after all the initial new player bonuses have been exhausted.\r\nFortunately, this energy is divided into two currencies. One for the campaign, and one for Guild missions. And yes, this game has guilds you can join that allows you to asynchronously give and request aid from your guildmates in the form of their main character assisting you in battles.\r\nOther F2P live service staples are also present in this game, such as spending real money to speedily unlock new heroes and get more energy. Bundles to unlock specific characters , resource boosts, or just outright buying the premium currency gems to mostly spend in opening chests.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5445266) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (NS)\r\n9.2\r\nOpen World\r\nRPG\r\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an extraordinary game that once again, redefines the open-world adventure genre and what’s possible for the rather aging Nintendo Switch hardware. Developed by Nintendo themselves, this game takes players on an jaw-dropping journey through the vast kingdom of Hyrule, now with a much needed verticality, essentially more than doubling the play area.\r\nFrom the moment you set foot in (or fall down) the game's expansive world, you are immediately captivated by its breathtaking scale and attention to detail. The game is set in Hyrule again, with the same core map featuring familiar locations, but the world has evolved so much since we’ve last seen it. Both from a gameplay and story standpoint.\r\nAside from the surface world, we now have the floating sky islands to explore, and a pitch black underground cave network as big as Hyrule itself, all of them holding many secrets for the players to uncover. Aside from the traditional surface world traversal, the sky above and the depths below both have widely differing mechanics in play. For example, The Depths are mostly in pitch black, which will require lighting them up in various ways to see around, although there is a permanent way of lighting areas up.\r\nJust like the open world, the story is openly structured and non-linear, meaning there is no definite way to progress through it. You can go wherever you want in the game world, and do missions at your own volition. The game features an evolving narrative that is well designed around the exploratory gameplay, with various narrative elements beautifully and slowly unravelling itself to the player — in no specific order — as you play the game.\r\nSpeaking of openness, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the most open Zelda game to date, and it’s not anymore just an open-world game. It is now effectively an open-world sandbox — As the game features two major additions to the game: The abilities Ultrahand and Fuse that literally change how the game is played. They allow the player to stitch around world objects in various ways — mostly to solve platforming puzzles, traverse the world, or outright channel the player’s inner creativity.\r\nPlayers can also fuse basically any world element as well to any weapon or shield that you have, or fuse an arrow to any item. Effectively providing a rewarding element that improves upon the predecessor’s weakest link, which is the weapon durability. Now here, the game rewards experimentation, and things breaking up isn’t as frustrating as before, because you can now break and fuse stuff together and constantly try new things.\r\nConsidering the game is running on a Nintendo Switch, it simply puts other newest-gen AAA titles to shame when it comes to optimization and polish. Still, It’s unfortunate that there is currently no way to play this masterpiece on higher resolutions and frame rates. On a Switch successor perhaps in a few years?\r\nSo far, Tears of the Kingdom has been a blast to play. I won't spoil it too much as many of the new mechanics and gameplay elements are best left for the players to unravel, especially during the early parts of the game. All I can say is that this game is set to be a timeless masterpiece and a worthy sequel to The Breath of the Wild.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5447831) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (NS)\r\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an action-adventure game and the much awaited sequel to 2017’s award-winning game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, boasting the same core gameplay mechanics including open world exploration and a non-linear story.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Sheer scale of the game world\r\n- Sense of freedom and exploration\r\n- Creative limitless sandbox mechanics\r\n- Masterful non-linear storytelling\r\n- Hundreds of hours of content\r\n## Cons\r\n- We really need a Switch 2 or Switch Pro to further enjoy this at higher resolution and frame rates\r\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an extraordinary game that once again, redefines the open-world adventure genre and what’s possible for the rather aging Nintendo Switch hardware. Developed by Nintendo themselves, this game takes players on an jaw-dropping journey through the vast kingdom of Hyrule, now with a much needed verticality, essentially more than doubling the play area.\r\nThe art style is stunning as always, featuring vibrant landscapes, lush forests, towering mountains, and serene lakes that we are all familiar with, as well as bringing in new locations that Zelda fans have never seen before. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle further enhance the immersive experience, as rain showers and sunsets add life to the already enchanting world.\r\nThe soundtrack deserves special praise as well, as it perfectly complements the game's atmosphere. The relaxing melodies that play in quiet explorative moments, the triumphant scores during intense battles, the eerie background music for exploring deep dark caverns, the music elevates the emotional impact of every scene.\r\nFrom the moment you set foot in the game's expansive world, you are immediately captivated by its breathtaking scale and attention to detail. The game is set in Hyrule again, with the same core map featuring familiar locations, but the world has evolved so much since we’ve last seen it. Both from a gameplay and story standpoint.\r\nAside from the surface world, we now have the floating sky islands to explore, and a pitch black underground cave network as big as Hyrule itself, all of them holding many secrets for the players to uncover. Aside from the traditional surface world traversal, the sky above and the depths below both have widely differing mechanics in play. For example, The Depths are mostly in pitch black, which will require lighting them up in various ways to see around, although there is a permanent way of lighting areas up.\r\nThis sheer scale gives players unparalleled agency over their adventures. You can go to nearly any surface, sky high, or deep below; launch yourself through the air and glide downwards like a battle royale game, explore anywhere really, and this is done all seamlessly, without loading screens. The scale of the world is mind-boggling — especially coming from the already impressive Breath of the Wild — offering countless secrets, hidden treasures, and surprises around every corner.\r\nThe story is set years after Breath of the Wild, seeing many changes to the game’s world. Including evolved and affected locations by the game’s story. The same core premise is here once again, which is about finding or saving Princess Zelda yet again. It sounds repetitive, but really it’s not. The story mostly serves as background flavor to the game’s underlying exploration gameplay which will take up the majority of the players’ time, but for how the story is presented, saying it is just a background flavor is a huge understatement as it is a stellar experience nonetheless.\r\nWhile Link was undoubtedly already powerful in his previous adventure, Tears of the Kingdom cleverly incorporates an in-lore reason to reset his abilities and bring him back to his base form. The start of the game focuses on Link relearning his power while also learning newfound game changing abilities that are the highlight of the game. By introducing fresh abilities, Tears of the Kingdom successfully avoids feeling like a rehash of its predecessor while still providing a familiar experience for fans.\r\nJust like the open world, the story is openly structured and non-linear, meaning there is no definite way to progress through it. You can go wherever you want in the game world, and do missions at your own volition. The game features an evolving narrative that is well designed around the exploratory gameplay, with various narrative elements beautifully and slowly unravelling itself to the player — in no specific order — as you play the game.\r\nAs a result of this openness, the gameplay itself is also emerging in nature, not really providing a clear cut path to the player on what to do. You can start off randomly exploring the world, stumbling upon a side quest, and before you realise it, you’re battling a big boss underground. The game puts emphasis on not overly relying on pre-determined quest markers and letting the player do them on their own.\r\nSpeaking of openness, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the most open Zelda game to date, and it’s not anymore just an open-world game. It is now effectively an open-world sandbox — As the game features two major additions to the game: The abilities Ultrahand and Fuse that literally change how the game is played. They allow the player to stitch around world objects in various ways — mostly to solve platforming puzzles, traverse the world, or outright channel the player’s inner creativity.\r\nIn traversing the world and solving puzzles. you may some times need to build contraptions that can greatly aid you; attach fans at the back, wings at the side of a cart to build a makeshift plane. Strap rockets to platforms to build literal rocket ships. It unexpectedly brought me flashbacks of playing Garry’s Mod and Kerbal Space Program, of all games. As with the traversal, creativity is also encouraged to tackle environmental obstacles and challenges in a way that also unexpectedly reminded me of another unrelated game — Death Stranding.\r\nPlayers can also fuse basically any world element as well to any weapon or shield that you have, or fuse any item to your arrows. Effectively providing a rewarding element that improves upon the predecessor’s weakest link, which is the weapon durability. Now here, the game rewards experimentation, and things breaking up isn’t as frustrating as before, because you can now break and fuse stuff together and constantly try new things.\r\nCombat as usual requires strategy and skill, with the varied enemies possessing unique attack patterns, weaknesses, and mechanics. The arsenal of weapons at your disposal infinitely increased by the Fuse system, offers a limitless number of ways to approach encounters.\r\nThe game massively rewards creativity, encouraging players to experiment with their surroundings and combine tools to overcome obstacles and foes, while still catering those who wouldn’t want that experience and would prefer to settle for the fundamental basics.\r\nAs for the technical performance, it performed rather well for the intended 30 FPS target, only occasionally dropping in busy fights and some highly demanding scenes. Despite the game being built as a sandbox experience, I’ve also had a bug free experience so far which is super impressive.\r\nConsidering the game is running on a Nintendo Switch, it simply puts other newest-gen AAA titles to shame when it comes to optimization and polish. Still, It’s unfortunate that there is currently no way to play this masterpiece on higher resolutions and frame rates. On a Switch successor perhaps in a few years?\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is another masterpiece that sets an even higher standard for open-world gaming. With its boundless exploration, creative gameplay mechanics, and a masterful emergent storytelling, it is an experience that will leave players in awe for years to come. Whether you're a longtime fan of the franchise or a newcomer to the series, this game is an absolute must-play for the Switch and a testament to the magic of video games. A potential GOTY for 2023.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5448027) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Guardian Chronicle R\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nGuardian Chronicle R is a tower defense hero collecting game featuring puzzle elements and PvP / coop action.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Satisfying puzzle and tower defense gameplay\r\n- Intuitive and easy to pick up game mechanics\r\n- Competitive PvP gameplay\r\n- Challenging singleplayer / coop action## Cons\r\n-UI needs a little quality-of-life work\r\nGuardian Chronicle R is the revamped version of the original Guardian Chronicle game from two years ago and features a similar gameplay style with some major improvements across the board and additional content.\r\nIt offers vibrant graphics, a mix of cell-shaded and anime art style, and lighthearted triumphant soundtrack to go along with it. The character and unit designs are visually appealing and familiar looking, leveraging the usual fantasy tropes that we have have with the archers, mages, warriors, with each hero having their own distinctive style and abilities. The animations are smooth and fluid, making sure the tower defense action is as satisfying as it can be.\r\nThe game offers a wide variety of units and heroes with unique abilities and attacks that players can deploy on the battlefield. Each unit and hero has different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for strategic gameplay and team composition. Players can grind and use some gacha luck to collect and upgrade units and heroes to improve their effectiveness in battle.\r\nIn Guardian Chronicle R, players take on the role of a commander and must defend their base from waves of enemies by placing hero units across the map. The game combines tower defense, real-time strategy, and puzzle elements, allowing players to strategically place and combine defensive heroes to fend off the incoming waves. Placing heroes will consume resources, which is in turn acquired by fending off units during the session.\r\nThe main highlight of Guardian Chronicle R is the puzzle-like element to it with the ability to fuse duplicate units together in the battlefield, upgrading them to the higher tiered level combining them into one unit. But there’s a catch, placing units, as well as upgrading them are all randomized from your deck of five, so there is a Tetris feel to it when it comes to the anticipation of the heroes that will be initially deployed or spawned as a result of a fuse. It’s all a satisfying balancing act of having to find the perfect balance between quality of quantity, with regards to resource consumption and fusing of heroes.\r\nAside from that, the positioning of the units will also come into play. Enemies will have a predetermined path from their spawn to your base, going around a “track”, so you will need to tactically place your units in a way that they must be defeated before they reach your base. Lastly, there are some synergy bonuses as well called Evolution, that unlocks an upgrade to heroes for that specific session, if the player is able to simultaneously deploy three different tiers of the same unit.\r\nThe whole system is pretty intuitive, you can drag duplicate units into each other to fuse them, or double tap a specific unit to auto-combine it with another close by if applicable. The latter is faster, but a riskier maneuver as there is no control on what hero unit will be consumed. And finally, the most clear cut improvement from the original Guardian Chronicle game is the hero tiers now have clear numbers and colors displayed below the units, making it visually easy to identify hero types and tiers.\r\nI must admit, it’s frantic action at first, just me tapping randomly in the hopes of landing a fuse for the characters and exhausting my resources as soon as I get them, but once I got the hang of it, the strategic aspect is really deep and the action is a more relaxed one, it's like playing a tower defense game and a puzzle game like 2048, 2Fuse, or Tetris Battle at the same time.\r\nGuardian Chronicle R features both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, players can progress through a campaign, facing increasingly challenging levels and bosses. Multiplayer mode allows players to team up with others in cooperative battles or compete against them in PvP matches with a ranking system.\r\nWhile the single-player and co-op mode is all about surviving the waves on your own or with a friend, the PvP is a whole other fun that is played in real-time. You are put side by side with an opposing player to defend your bases simultaneously, and the first one to fail, loses. PvP is probably the best mode out of the game, because it’s so much fun having to strategize defending your base with the goal of outperforming the opponent.\r\nAs part of being a live-service free-to-play game, it has all the hallmarks of being one. Login bonuses, gachas, premium currency, but fortunately there is no energy system in place to limit play. As a free-to-play experience, the game is perfectly enjoyable, especially if your focus is on the PvP element. My minor gripes with the game, it lacks get all or claim all buttons for many of the rewards and bonus pages, requiring you to click on each of them. As well as the lack of the players for other game modes when matchmaking.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5453784) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Door Kickers\r\nGameplay\r\nI played Door Kickers on PC many years ago and now, playing it’s mobile port, it brings the same intense and strategic gameplay that made it a hit on the larger screen. Developed by KillHouse Games, Door Kickers offers an intense mix of tactical planning, real-time execution, and satisfyingly challenging missions — assuming it goes well.\r\n## Pros\r\n- deep tactical planning\r\n- intense real-time action\r\n- intuitive touch controls\r\n- 100 missions + mission editor## Cons\r\n-No cons\r\nAt its core, Door Kickers is a top-down real-time strategy game that puts you in command of an elite SWAT team, from planning to execution. Your mission is to neutralize threats, save hostages, and complete objectives within a variety of scenarios. The game's strength lies in its tactical depth — both in pre-planning and in the actual real-time execution, offering an impressive array of tools and options to tackle each mission.\r\nTouch controls are overwhelming at first as opposed to trying this first out with a mouse, but for those who are used to playing mobile games and especially for those who haven't played the PC version, this won’t be a major issue. Actually, the touch controls are intuitive and the game is more playable than I expected. The game's interface has been optimized for smaller screens without sacrificing functionality or visual clarity. However, If you have a tablet to play this with, it can definitely help provide a much better experience, it’s recommended but not essential.\r\nBefore each mission, you can meticulously plan your approach by setting waypoints, determining the entry points, assigning roles, and analyzing enemy positions. The freedom to strategize and adapt your plan to the ever-changing situations is where Door Kickers truly shines. It’s just like drawing on a floor plan or blueprint and directing your squad what to do. Every movement, every turn, every opening of a turn, every grenade, every peek and eventual breach is up to you.\r\nOnce the mission begins, the tension mounts as you execute your plotted plan in real-time. You have the ability to pause the action at any moment to reevaluate your strategy and it adds an extra layer of real-time tactical depth, allowing you to make any changes and just not hope your initial plan pans out successfully, as well as allowing you to make calculated decisions rather than relying solely on reflexes. This blend of real-time action and tactical planning creates a unique and immersive gameplay experience.\r\nDoor Kickers offers an impressive amount of content, with over 100 challenging missions across various environments, including hostage rescues, bomb defusals, and assassination prevention. Each mission presents a different set of obstacles, floor layout, and requires a well-thought-out plan to achieve success. The escalating difficulty curve ensures that even experienced players will be put to the test.\r\nFurthermore, the game features a mission generator, allowing players to create their own scenarios and share them with the community. This user-generated content adds a virtually limitless replayability factor, ensuring that the fun doesn't end even after completing the main campaign.\r\nAs for your SWAT team, you are free to customize your own lineup and loadout for the characters. As you gain more stars by completing missions, you can unlock new classes to use like the assaulter, breacher, or stealth. And come up with a load out that matches these classes accordingly and synergies with other teammates and mission layouts. There is perma-death if these members die in a mission, and they will be replaced by a newly trained recruit, so you somewhat grow attached to these members sort of like an RPG game in iron man mode, and learn to actually care for their survival.\r\nYou are free to come up with your own challenges for yourself and approach the missions in any way you see fit. Challenge yourself and do the missions with a solo operator? Want to focus on a stealthy approach? Or a loud guns out approach? Or do you want to challenge your planning skills and strictly avoid pausing in-game and just purely rely on your initial plan? It's kind of a sandbox game, where you are just given a playground, a vague goal, and the tools to play with it.\r\nAlthough Door Kickers doesn't boast cutting-edge graphics, it presents a clean and functional aesthetic that serves its purpose well. The top-down cut-out view of the levels provides a clear and comprehensive view of the action, allowing players to assess the battlefield with ease. There is a cone vision gameplay mechanic to obscure enemies, so it's still realistic in that sense. The user interface is intuitive and doesn't clutter the screen, ensuring that the focus remains on the tactical aspects of the game.\r\nIn terms of sound design, Door Kickers delivers an immersive experience. From the tense tactical background music that heightens the atmosphere to the satisfying sound effects of breached doors, radio chatter, and silenced shots, each audio element contributes to the game's overall tension and engagement.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5456322) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "lyndonguitar\r\n## Pros\r\n- Good core gameplay idea\r\n- Charming clay-looking graphics\r\n- Unique premise and lore## Cons\r\n-Needs a lot of work\r\n-Game breaking bugs\r\n-Performance issues, crashes, and long loading times\r\n-Clunky combat mechanics and flow\r\n-Unresponsive controls\r\nThe eponymous Somnolent is a world called the dreamcatcher where the game is also set. It is a place where good dreams pass through, while bad dreams get stuck. In layman's terms, Somnolent functions as a filter for nightmares. This requires the dreamwalkers — warriors summoned to defend dreams — to constantly purge Somnolent of the bad dreams that get trapped in the lands and the nightmarish monsters spawned by them.\r\nSomnolent feels high production from the first looks, and the gameplay format is something that would come out on consoles and PCs with its open world-esque design and third person view. The graphics have a distinct aesthetic, reminiscent of clay-built visuals and CGI from the 2000s that are now instead rendered into in-game graphics.\r\nOur character is one of the newly summoned dreamwalkers, devoid of any memories from their past — which allows us to be immersed in that character. This narrative follows a common trope known as Isekai, often seen in many mobile games. However, the story itself holds its uniqueness, and the lore is compelling enough to drive the narrative forward. There is no voice-acting though, so while the game is really interesting, all the dialogue must be read.\r\nThe gameplay features a third-person action RPG perspective, where the character possesses basic attack, dodge, and jump abilities to navigate the environment, including subtle platforming elements.\r\nAdditionally, the player can utilize various skills that are determined by the equipped weapon type, effectively determining the character's class. These classes range from dual-wielding rogues to sword and shield wielding warriors, and even one-handed sword warriors. Switching classes is as straightforward as changing the equipped weapon set.\r\nFurthermore, players have the option to upgrade their weapons and dismantle them for materials. They can also level up their character by defeating monsters throughout the game, and clearing bad dreams of nightmarish monsters one after the other.\r\nAfter the introduction to the Somnolent village, the game presents us with some fetch quests that aid us in getting started, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with the mechanics and the flow of the game, gather materials, eliminate local fauna, and engage in conversations with the villagers.\r\nThe combat shows a lot of promise with its flashy special effects, third person action, and a diverse range of skills., but it currently needs a lot of work to be able to provide an enjoyable experience to the player.\r\nDespite having sleek animations, the combat system feels clunky and unresponsive. Frequent stuns and staggering mechanics frustratingly impede movement, while the touch controls often lack responsiveness. Furthermore, the camera occasionally drifts to unintended directions for some reason, further hindering the overall combat experience.\r\nAside from the clunky combat, I have also encountered some bugs with the gameplay in general, such as broken quest progressions, monsters infinitely spawning and attacking characters in the middle of conversations, and quest markers that are outright broken — directing me to open a chest that doesn't exist, that even persists across game restarts.\r\nSomnolent performed poorly on my 2018 flagship Android phone. Although there was a slight improvement in performance on my 2020 flagship tablet, it still fell significantly short compared to games of similar scope, also with occasional crashes and long loading times. It is safe to say that this game is probably best played — for now — on newer and more powerful devices to fully enjoy the experience.\r\nI really want to enjoy Somnolent, the premise is great, the idea of the combat looks solid, but it is currently filled with many issues that hinder the overall experience. For now, it needs a lot of work.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5461731) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With its play on words in the title, \"Exolotl\" the game clearly draws inspiration from the real-life cute animal, the axolotl. The character designs embody the charming features of axolotls, adding a touch of whimsy and friendliness to the game.\r\nThe attention to detail in the pixel art is commendable, capturing the essence of the platforming era with its pixelated art design and 8 bit animations, while still delivering a visually pleasing experience. The character designs are distinct, and enemy designs showcase creativity, offering a wide array of alien, mutant, flora, and robotic adversaries to overcome.\r\nThe game's core mechanics center around platforming and action-oriented gameplay. Players control Zian, the sword wielding prince, and his friends as they navigate through levels, defeat enemies, and ultimately save the Planet.\r\nExolotl : Zian's touch control layout is a bit different that what mobile gamers are used to, as it features a traditional cross style on-screen button layout more commonly seen in physical controllers. The traditional button format allows console oriented players to have a more familiar looking layout.\r\nHowever, the buttons' small size and the joysticks' fixed position can be problematic, making precise inputs challenging and leading to occasional frustration. The absence of customization options to adjust button sizes or reposition them is a missed opportunity to cater to players with varying preferences and playstyles. For having a control scheme that closely resembles physical controllers, it was a bit surprising to find that it does not support actual physical controllers.\r\nThe ability to switch between characters seamlessly during specific levels, without any resource requirement or cooldown, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging, encouraging players to experiment and discover who’s effective against different enemies and bosses. However, it would have been even more compelling if each character had a wholly unique gameplay mechanic or skill tree, further emphasizing their individuality.\r\nThe level design is well thought out, with hidden areas to discover, baby exolotls to free, collectibles to find, and platforming sections that test players' reflexes, precision, and patience. The game's twelve levels and eight boss battles provide a decent length, offering a challenging gameplay experience for platforming enthusiasts.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5473403) Originally posted on TapTap.",

However the presentation seems inconsistent and all over the place, ranging from impressive high production CGI sequences and highly detailed graphics, to a barebones-looking UI and weak story delivery. There is English localization available for the menus and dialogues (without voice-acting), but the translation quality is questionable with numerous instances of murkiness.\r\nIn ANNULUS, players assume the role of a regiment commander, navigating the chaotic land of Novusaes.

Players engage in turn-based tactical battles on a grid-like battlefield, where they can select up to four or so combatants from their squad before the battle starts.\r\nThere are three main melee weapon classes used by the characters, such as Guns (It’s essentially just a Spear but probably poorly translated), Swords, and Axes.  What sets these melee weapon classes apart is the implementation of a rock-paper-scissors weakness system. This means that each class has certain advantages and disadvantages against the others. For example, Guns might be effective against Axes but weaker against Swords, while Swords may have an advantage over Guns but be less effective against Axes.\r\nThis system adds a strategic element to combat, requiring players to consider which character to bring out to missions and adapt their playstyle accordingly. Aside from these melee weapons, there are also ranged weapon types like the archer and magic that can do different types of damage from a distance. There is also a separate weakness system for them, but mainly involves unit types. For example, flying units will take more damage from archers.\r\nANNULUS features over a possible hundred classes for the characters that you can recruit, and the option to jump between different similar classes of the same category. Nightingale, great swordsman, imperial marshal, trickster, doctor, knight, guard, ranger, in what looks like every class permutation you can think of, ANNULUS has it to some degree.\r\nThe combat in ANNULUS is engaging and challenging, with characters possessing unique abilities, strengths, and mechanics. A counter-attack mechanism is in place, allowing units to retaliate if the attacker is within range, ensuring that units remain active even during the opponent's turn.\r\nThere are different objectives for the missions, such as clearing the level of enemies, killing a single target, or just plain surviving for a definite amount of turns. Failing to complete the objectives within the given conditions, typically 12 turns, or losing all units results in defeat. There are also bonus conditions that result in greater rewards, such as not letting too many units die, or finishing the stage in 5 turns.\r\nThere is indeed an auto feature for the combat, but it is only available for the side missions and activities, not for the main campaign. Which is an unfortunate design decision as autoplay is something this game probably needs, with how slow the combat is sometimes. Especially for those with already geared up squads looking for more challenges.\r\nANNULUS is set to become a free-to-play game; Consequently, the game incorporates premium currency, gacha mechanics for acquiring heroes, a grind-heavy progression system for upgrading them, and utilizes a time-based currency or energy system that restricts gameplay unless players either wait or make in-game purchases.\r\nAs far as the beta test goes, ANNULUS has performed satisfactorily for me.

There is no clear explanation, but the premise looks like a purgatory where you must guide humans to their eventual afterlife.\r\nThe game features low-poly graphics enhanced by an impressive lighting system, creating an otherworldly atmosphere with a perfect blend of heavenly aesthetics and high-tech weirdness. The visuals make little sense outside of the puzzles and overall objective. Despite the large number of humans on screen, the low-poly style allows for smooth rendering. The soundtrack is as equally as otherworldly, mesmerizing and therapeutic, which is perfect for the purgatory themed puzzle solving nature of the game.\r\nIn HUMANITY, you control a dog from a third-person perspective, reminiscent of the control scheme found in the cat-themed game \"Stray.\" You navigate the levels by jumping around, riding crowds, and issuing instructions to the humans, one tile at a time. You cannot die, and there are no penalties for falling; you simply respawn at the top.\r\nWhile the third-person gameplay adds an additional layer to the puzzle-solving element as you have to control a character on top of solving a level-wide puzzle, Some players may find it bothersome or unnecessary, and instead prefer a direct point-and-click puzzle game without having to control any characters, as it can sometimes get in the way of the puzzle solving action.\r\nWithout your guidance, the humans will fall into the chasms below and respawn at the starting point without consequences. As the shepherd dog, your role is to herd these human hordes through various challenging navigational puzzles and obstacles by providing instructions such as where and when to turn, how high and how long to jump, and many more commands and instructions that you can issue.\r\nThroughout the levels, there are other interactive elements such as weight-triggered switches to activate devices or deactivate obstacles, movable blocks for the humans to push, and golden humans that can be awakened by the actions of regular humans. Successfully guiding these golden humans to the light rewards you with gold, granting extra abilities like fast-forwarding or pausing during puzzles. However, if these golden humans fall, they will not respawn, requiring a restart if you want to obtain the rewards, making their guidance crucial and consequential.\r\nAs far as restarting goes, the game is ultimately forgiving when it comes to do-overs. One of the abilities that you can unlock is the ability to keep issued commands to tiles so you don’t have to redo most of them again. However take note that this isn’t always the best option, as sometimes complete restarts are better.\r\nThe heart of HUMANITY lies in its superbly designed puzzles, which range from intriguing brain-teasers to challenging navigational obstacles. Each level presents a unique set of challenges, commands, and mechanics in play, ensuring that players are consistently engaged and their problem-solving skills are put to the test level after level.\r\nIn the story mode levels, players are tested in a lot of aspects, with each level typically focusing on one or two specific skills such as planning, reflexes, physics anticipation, spatial awareness, logical thinking, and memorization.\r\nThe satisfaction of successfully guiding the humans through the complexities of the levels is immensely rewarding, and the game's forgiving nature in terms of restarts allows players to experiment and find the best strategies. The bonus optional element of guiding golden humans, known as \"goldys\", adds an additional layer of difficulty, challenging players' problem-solving skills, as these goldys are often positioned in out-of-the-way locations.\r\nThe puzzles themselves are overall superbly challenging and can take you anywhere from a few minutes to an hour of problem solving and troubleshooting, depending on your skill level.\r\nThere are around 90 story mode challenges to complete, as well as the highly intuitive level editor to basically give endless replayability to players.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5486137) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Starship Troopers: Extermination\r\n9.6\r\nStarship Troopers: Extermination is a 16 player co-op FPS for PC that has just recently been released in early access. Players can experience the thrill of battling hordes of bugs alongside fellow troopers.\r\nThe cooperative nature of Starship Troopers: Extermination allows players to squad up and take on the Arachnid threat together, bringing the teamwork and camaraderie that is integral to the Starship Troopers universe. The experience so far has been a very positive one, with the community having an amazing population of players that are in on it, and just purely embraces the team-based fun that is the game.\r\nStarship Troopers: Extermination features a class-based system for the players, which offers three distinct roles: Hunter, Bastion, and Operator. The Hunter class excels at mobility, utilizing a jetpack to navigate the battlefield with ease. Bastions, on the other hand, are the fortified tanks of the squad, boasting heavier armor and the ability to deploy an instant 360-degree shield for impromptu defenses. Operators focus on objectives, providing support to the team through healing and reviving fallen comrades.\r\nStarship Troopers: Extermination features a multi-phase mission structure that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The offensive, defensive, and survival phases offer different objectives and challenges for players to overcome. During the offensive phase, players undertake randomized objectives such as securing landing zones, capturing territories, or repairing structures, or delivering resources .\r\nThe ARC objective at the end introduces a frantic base building element that adds an exciting layer of strategy and urgency. Players must construct defenses within a tight time limit, creating an adrenaline-fueled experience as they scramble to fortify their position against the incoming hordes of Bugs, making players move faster than they can think . The satisfaction of successfully defending the base, especially on higher difficulties, is satisfying and amplified by the cooperative nature of the game.\r\nAs with many early access titles, Starship Troopers: Extermination does have a few — possibly temporary — shortcomings. The lack of text chat and limited customization options can hinder communication and personalization. I’ve also encountered some bugs such as delayed sound of guns firing, or clipping through objects or structures.  Nevertheless, it's encouraging to know that the developers have plans to expand the game with more game modes and additional locations or planets to explore.\r\nOverall, the game is already fun to play, even with its highly repetitive form, especially if you're playing this with friends. However, don’t expect a lot of variety when it comes to the maps and missions, as it only features one map and two missions for now.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5527571) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Rebel Inc.\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nGameplay\r\nFrom the same studio behind the popular game Plague Inc., Rebel Inc. puts players in the role of a leader tasked with stabilizing a war-torn region by managing military and civilian initiatives, balancing the needs of the population, and combating insurgent forces.\r\n## Pros\r\n- An immersive political sim experience\r\n- A challenging balancing-act between handling civilians, the government, and insurgents\r\n- Unique premise of stabilizating a war-torn region\r\n- Lots of maps and scenarios to play in## Cons\r\n-New players might find the mechanics confusing\r\n-Events aren’t as varied as I expected\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nPerfectly playable in free-to-play, but the paid version has some added depth and quality of life features.\r\nRebel Inc., developed by Ndemic Creations, is a mobile strategy game that offers an immersive political sim experience with a unique premise. As a leader tasked with stabilizing a war-torn region, players must navigate complex political landscapes, manage limited resources, and confront the persistent threat of insurgent forces\r\nThe core mechanics revolve around balancing civilian initiatives with military operations to restore stability. As the leader, you must allocate resources efficiently, invest in infrastructure, build trust with the local population, and counter the influence of rebel groups. The game cleverly incorporates realistic factors such as corruption, inflation, war weariness, and insurgencies, adding layers of complexity and realism to the gameplay.\r\nRebel Inc. presents players with a diverse range of challenges, making each playthrough feel unique. It’s kind of overwhelming at first even with the helpful tutorial and tooltips, with many gameplay elements at play. There are three main infrastructures that you need to balance: Civilian, Government, and Military. At start, the different initiatives and projects you can undertake aren't quite clear cut yet, and you will probably have to fumble around in the first few minutes of the game, or even the first few sessions.\r\nYour main goal is to turn a zero stability war-torn region, into a stable country, all while maintaining your reputation and ensuring the country does not succumb to corruption, economical collapse, or insurgents. It becomes a balancing act of maintaining reputation, increasing stability, controlling insurgents, inflation, and corruption that provides a very compelling gameplay experience.\r\nFor the most part, much of the game revolves around the player's decision-making and clicking around the interface: what infrastructure to prioritize, how to conserve money, and how to handle reputation. Rebel Inc. excels in offering strategic depth, a hallmark of great strategy games. The game introduces a multitude of variables that players must consider while making decisions. Throughout the game, various in-game events occur that present players with choices, each carrying possible repercussions or rewards.\r\nFrom managing the military presence and deploying forces to understanding the political climate and conducting diplomatic negotiations, every action has far-reaching consequences. The complexity arises from the delicate balancing act between short-term stability and long-term development, requiring players to make tough choices that can shape the course of the game. However, I soon noticed that the events presented had become repetitive, and the game could have greatly benefited from a wider variety of event types to enhance the overall experience.\r\nThe main source of action you will get from this game is the strategic warfare against the insurgents. Players must strategically position their military units by dragging icons across the map to locate and corner enemy units for elimination. This task can prove challenging and even frustrating, especially if you lack enough troops and having to chase insurgents around the map for extended periods — but this all the more makes the experience more authentic. Visual-wise, it’s a very simple rendition, but one that is still effective at giving the player a strategic challenge, especially when mixed with the resource balancing elements of the game.\r\nRebel Inc. boasts polished hand painted-looking 2D Visuals unlike the PC version which was in full 3D. Still, it brings these war-torn regions to life, only in another style. The maps are detailed and vibrant, portraying the various war-torn regions with impressive art, one that I found much better looking than the 3D graphics of the PC version. The user interface is intuitive and is built from the ground up for touch controls, and looks way different from the PC version. It’s easy to navigate through menus and manage various aspects of the game. The attention to detail extends to the sound design as well, with an atmospheric soundtrack that complements the thrilling and immersive gameplay.\r\nRebel Inc. is a free-to-play title with many in-app purchases that affect the gameplay, but not to the extent that it becomes unplayable without spending money. The game effectively distinguishes features between the free-to-play and paid versions.\r\nThe free-to-play experience of Rebel Inc. is perfectly playable on its own. Players can enjoy the core gameplay mechanics, strategic depth, and engaging narrative without feeling pressured to spend money. The game does not create artificial barriers that hinder progress or restrict essential content behind paywalls. This approach ensures that players who prefer not to spend money can still have a rewarding experience.\r\nThe in-app purchases in Rebel Inc. mainly offer quality of life additions that enhance gameplay convenience but are not necessary to enjoy or succeed in the game. Features like a fast forward function, advisors, or a full-on campaign provide optional benefits that can make the gameplay experience more solid, or introduce new variables to play with. However, these additions do not fundamentally alter the core mechanics or render the free version of the game incomplete.\r\nFurthermore, in the paid version, Rebel Inc. provides even more approaches as to how you can play the game. Players can choose from different governor types, each with unique abilities and advantages. Whether you opt for a military-focused approach or prioritize winning the hearts and minds of the local population through infrastructure projects, the game accommodates diverse playstyles. This flexibility ensures that each campaign feels like a fresh experience, encouraging players to experiment and refine their strategies.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5548475) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dragon Arise is a dragon collecting fantasy RPG that takes players on a whimsical journey into a world filled with dragons and epic battles.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Strategic squad building gameplay\r\n- Automated battles\r\n- Remarkable graphics\r\n- Plenty of side activities and extra gameplay mechanics\r\n- Intuitive progression mechanics## Cons\r\n-Not much depth in actual combat\r\n-Energy currency to limit play\r\nDragon Arise is a dragon-themed RPG that features the player taking on the role of the main character who is transported into a dragon world in yet another Isekai-esque premise. As the prophesied savior of the Dragon Islands, your mission is to lead a legion of dragons against the encroaching curse and restore balance to the lands.\r\nIt features remarkable graphics from the start, with a mix of high definition artwork, stunning 3D models, and a stylized fantastical rendition of dragons and their world. The dragons look cartoonish but still highly detailed. Each dragon is meticulously designed, blending cartoonish aesthetics with intricate details that showcase their unique abilities and elemental affinities. Whether it's witnessing a red dragon unleashing fiery wrath or commanding a resilient rocky tank-like dragon, the visuals never fail to impress.\r\nThe gameplay is composed of you assembling a group of dragons, collecting them through various means: Playing the game, through gacha mechanics, or outright spending real money. These dragons can be leveled up, their skills enhanced, and their genes improve to further upgrade their limits. You can create a team of five dragons to bring into missions, and customize their deployment formation. The customization options allow for diverse strategies, ensuring that every player can create a unique dragon squad tailored to the enemy.\r\nThe beginner experience is a very welcoming one, with a highly comprehensive tutorial to help the player learn the ropes. The resources given are plentiful, I was able to build a max five-dragon squad immediately, and the first many missions are doable without yet fiddling much with the dragons. New gameplay elements are slowly unlocked as the player progresses through the game. There is an energy currency in play, so the later missions will definitely exhaust your energy and you will be encouraged to spend money or wait, but this aspect only comes a little bit later once you’ve invested a considerable amount of time in the game already.\r\nWhile the battles themselves are automated, they are still visually appealing thanks to the remarkable graphics design. And they are still challenging to play because the composition of your dragon team matters. Winning or losing a battle can sometimes just be determined by one simple dragon swap in the lineup. The strategic depth lies in the composition of your dragon team. Choosing the right dragons with complementary abilities and exploiting enemy weaknesses becomes crucial for success.\r\nThe missions themselves are automatically played out, and players only need to watch. They can, however, opt to manually activate abilities, or to increase the speed of combat to 2x. The fights usually boil down to unit stats , their specific elemental abilities and its effects on the enemies in play in a chess-like manner.\r\nThe main campaign takes you into an epic journey across the Dragon world, and allows you to explore each area in an open manner, but only one mission at a time. These missions are either character interactions, world interactions, or battles that players will need to complete to unlock the next mission.\r\nProgression revolves around upgrading the dragons to be able to survive and defeat increasingly difficult missions. Upgrading these dragons can become grindy. Fortunately, the game mechanics are accessible; how to do upgrades, when to find the requirements, are easy to figure out thanks to the intuitive UI and informative tutorial.\r\nDragon Arise also involves kingdom building aspects in the likes of Clash of Clans, by giving players the opportunity to build their main island and construct buildings. There is a prerequisite system in play, with buildings requiring other buildings or player levels to be able to continuously build. With each building providing different bonuses to the player.\r\nAside from the main campaign, there are also other side activities such as an endless battle, an increasingly challenging set of missions mirroring the main campaign, or a simplified dungeon crawling experience to spice up the whole experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5612678) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Destiny Saga\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDestiny Saga is a narratively-driven retro-style Action RPG with gacha elements and seamless switching between party characters\r\n## Pros\r\n- Nostalgic retro-style JRPG art style\r\n- Fluid and engaging ARPG combat\r\n- Seamless character switching## Cons\r\n-Movement controls need tweaking\r\nDestiny Saga is a mash-up of retro-style goodness, JRPG art style, ARPG gameplay, and modern gacha and RPG elements. Players can collect heroes, upgrade and equip them with gear, and engage in ARPG combat, all while being driven by a compelling narrative story.\r\nThe premise is centered around an investigative saga. Twelve years ago, the Montereys continent experienced a disaster known as the Xorc Crisis. The player, named protagonist, sets out to explore the continent once again with their friends, with only one clue - a core chip from twelve years ago. Their goal is to uncover the cause of the crisis.\r\nVisually, Destiny Saga strikes a nostalgic chord with its traditional pixel art retro style for the in-game visuals, but the characters during dialogue are represented in visual novel-like Anime renditions. It’s your standard run-of-the-mill retro JRPG art design, including the sound design which features a mix of melodramatic and triumph tones commonly seen in many JRPG games. There are no voice acting, and everything — including dialogue — must be read by the player.\r\nThe gameplay follows a 2.5D style of format, in which the character is able to move in all four cardinal directions, however attacks can only be performed sideways or horizontally, which is still highly reminiscent of side-scrolling game style of combat. The only chance you can do damage vertically, is by use of skills. It’s worth noting though, that some enemies, especially bosses, can attack vertically.\r\nDungeon crawling element revolves around the player clearing rooms one after the other. You cannot proceed to the next room until the level is cleared. These missions are divided into multiple levels or “floors” (which is weird, because some missions are outdoors).\r\nOne of the unique standout features of Destiny Saga is the seamless character switching. From your unlocked characters, you can form a squad of three to bring in missions. These characters \"merge\" into one during gameplay, but allowing for seamless switching or tagging between them with only a very quick cooldown.\r\nThis feature enables you to chain attacks based on your squad composition, encouraging constant switching between characters and cycling through their skills. With each character having different health points and skills, the combat feels dynamic and fresh, offering engaging back-and-forth action between the three characters. The smooth transition between characters keeps the action fluid and engaging, ensuring players are always in control.\r\nWhile character switching is enjoyable and intuitive, I cannot say the same for the movement controls. The UI element occupies too much space on the left side of the screen, limiting on-screen movement controls to the lower left corner only. It's not particularly comfortable to use, and even after changing the movement stick style from \"fixed\" to \"free,\" it didn't fully resolve the issue. Considering the game's restriction to horizontal attacks only, movement controls are an important aspect that requires further tweaking.\r\nAlthough it is marketed as an roguelike + ARPG, I don’t really see any rogue-likeness in it. There is no permadeath. When all of your characters die, you can still retry the mission or boss fight without having lost any progress or having to restart anything back from zero. It may have that rogue-like feel with the Dungeon Crawling, but I think the term Dungeon Crawler would have been a better choice to define this game.\r\nAs for the ARPG elements, Destiny Saga features a traditional RPG system commonly seen in mobile gacha games. Recruiting the other heroes and acquiring rarer items requires some form of premium currency, grinding, or waiting.\r\nThese individual heroes can be leveled up not only by killing monsters but also by \"upgrading\" them using materials and resources obtained from the game world. This upgrading aspect also applies to weapons and items. The itemization is reminiscent of ARPG game design, with items of different rarities providing various stat bonuses, including set items that can be completed to gain even more bonuses.\r\nThere is also an energy currency to limit dungeon runs, as well as the ability to instantly re-run finished dungeons for quick loot. Fortunately, many of the main quest missions do not require energy to proceed.\r\nDestiny Saga presents a challenging gameplay experience that rewards skillful play and strategic decision-making. The intense combat, coupled with the limited attack directions, adds a layer of tactical thinking that keeps players on their toes. The boss battles are hard in their own right, with devastating AOE attacks that the player will need to learn in order to properly avoid them.\r\nWhile fully singleplayer, the game incorporates a form of online connectivity with other players by means of a global chat and announcement messages like when players defeat a boss, it feels a bit MMORPG and makes the world more alive in a way, and it’s a nice touch.\r\nWhile Destiny Saga is still under developed, the game already feels feature complete and is perfectly playable. However, the whole model is probably not yet finalized. You can expect a decent amount of grinding or spending real money to unlock the more heroes and gear. Still, I hope that this will be a fun game to pick up and play without the absolute need to spend money.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5597508) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Aether Gazer is a Action RPG gacha game set in a virtual world where humans have transcended into after a catastrophic war and have since forgotten their true origins. Players take on the role of the administrator of “Aether Gazer''. Fighters called Modifiers are tasked to protect this virtual world from corrupted beings called Visbanes.\r\nAether Gazer offers a wide array of playable characters to collect, each with their unique designs, personalities, and abilities. With all the waifu games coming out lately, it’s worth noting that this is not one of them, as it also features male characters to collect. The characters are beautifully designed with anime-inspired art style, featuring elaborate costumes, expressive facial features, and eye-catching animations.\r\nAs said earlier, these fighter characters are called Modifiers, and are obtained by playing the game and through a gacha system. You can upgrade these characters in a traditional RPG system commonly seen in mobile gacha games,\r\nThe combat in Aether Gazer combines real-time hack and slash action with role-based abilities and strategic team compositions. The game features fluid and dynamic animations that bring the characters and their abilities to life, effectively capturing the over-the-top kinetic feel of anime. Each character's attacks, skills, and ultimate abilities are visually distinct and impactful, providing a sense of weight and power during combat. The on-screen touch controls of the game are also commendable, as they are smooth and responsive.\r\nBefore the start of missions, you have the option to select up to three characters to accompany you and designate a team leader whom you will control. Different characters will possess unique synergies with each other, particularly in terms of how the team's ultimate skill is activated. You can advance through various chapters, completing missions one at a time.\r\nUltimately, progression in the game boils down to your character's level, stats, and slightly, the extent of your skill. You can level up your character, enhance their tier level through transcendence, and upgrade their skills, abilities, perks, and stats, to be able to progress into higher missions. Naturally, there is the option to spend money to expedite your progress and gain an advantage more rapidly.\r\nAs a gacha game, Aether Gazer includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, premium currency, and a generous energy system to limit play — nothing out of the ordinary. However, as a free-to-play experience, I find the game highly enjoyable, especially if you have a genuine appreciation for the fluid combat mechanics and are willing to invest more time and embrace the added challenge that comes from playing F2P.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5621132) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Monster Menu (NS, PS4, PS5)\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nMonster Menu: The Scavenger's Cookbook is a dungeon crawling surviving turn-based RPG with a heavy focus on cooking and monster eating, released for the Nintendo Switch and Playstation\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique monster menu system, eat everything, cook everything!\r\n- A good mix of rogue-like and survival mechanics\r\n- Complete character and party customization## Cons\r\n-Combat can easily get repetitive over time\r\n-Looks outdated visually and from a technical standpoint\r\n-Clunky direct third person controls that feels out of place\r\nMonster Menu: The Scavenger's Cookbook is a game that attempts to blend elements of rogue-like dungeon crawling, survival crafting, cooking sim, and turn-based combat mechanics. It features cel-shaded anime chibi art style and a third person view gameplay.\r\nThe game starts with the player created rookie character in his maiden exploration of what is claimed to be a novice dungeon. However, the character quickly finds himself in a life and death situation, with extreme hunger and dehydration as he is lost in the supposedly novice dungeon. As a last resort, he is forced to eat a part of a dying corpse to survive. Yes, underneath this lighthearted chibi art style, there lies a somewhat gruesome and disgusting premise of monster consumption that permeates throughout the whole game.\r\nAfter enduring the corpse-eating session, he collapses, and wakes up in a random camp. There, the player is given three more characters to create: Choose from a selection of base appearances, then customize its characteristics, traits, and features. Such as, face, hair, clothing, class, personality, or even voice. You can even create male looking female characters, or vice versa. The players are essentially creating a whole four-man party of their liking.\r\nThen the actual gameplay starts, which centers around progressing in a series of increasingly harder rogue-like dungeons, trying to find the next floor, and all while surviving. By saying survive, you not only need to worry about enemies, but also hunger and dehydration. As the game puts it, you need your calories to survive.\r\nThe dungeon crawling involves direct control of characters trying to find the entrance to the next floor, instead of commanding their movements, both during exploration and in combat. All four characters combine into one entity, but they separate during combat when encountering monsters. Monsters roam the levels, and upon contact, the surroundings promptly transform into a grid-like battleground, initiating a turn-based combat format. Approaching them from behind gives you a free first attack, and vice versa.\r\nThe whole combat seems rather rudimentary. You can attack monsters, use items, and depending on your class, use different abilities such as AOE attacks. Some attacks are melee, some are fully ranged, and some have specific distances in which they can attack. After a while, it can easily get repetitive, especially with repetitive looking monsters and repetitive use of abilities. The only unique aspect is the “devour” option, which gives the characters the ability to eat (yes, EAT) fallen monsters while in combat, granting them bonuses, or even stat penalties.\r\nMuch of the magic that comes in this game comes in the camp system where the party can rest between dungeons. In this system, players have the ability to craft various items, such as arrows or cooking tools. Additionally, the game features the highly intricate \"Monster Menu\" system, which enables players to prepare dishes using discovered predefined recipes or engage in experimental cooking by combining random ingredients.\r\nThis system is a powerful one, and is strongly encouraged for the players to utilize. Apart from providing calories for survival, it can also bestow a range of bonuses to the characters, otherwise unobtainable by other means.\r\nAs part of the rogue-like experience. Dying will result in do-overs for everything. Well, almost everything. You still keep some items, such as recipes, equipment, and your hard-earned meta knowledge that you can use to progress further. Depending on your difficulty level, additional items may also be lost. It being a rogue-like really emphasizes the survival aspect of the game, and encourages leveraging the power of cooking even more.\r\nSide-stepping into the visuals department, they appear to be very outdated, even by Nintendo Switch standards. The overall aesthetic resembles something from the PS2 era. Although the cel-shaded graphics for the characters pose no issue, the environments, reminiscent of the PS2 era, are clearly outdated and lack personality. Combine that with the menu system which has a somewhat PS1-like appearance, and the weirdly still lengthy loading times, the game lacks the visual prowess one would expect from a technical standpoint.\r\nThe direct controls are also clunky and don’t really fit with the dungeon-crawling turn-based format of the game. Additionally, some camera issues plague the game, with hard to control third person view, and various elements in the world sometimes obstructing the characters' vision.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5633603) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Cyber Manhunt\r\nGameplay\r\nCyber Manhunt is a mystery and hacking simulation game with a story-oriented focus and a puzzle-centric gameplay.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Accurate but streamlined hacking mechanics\r\n- Engaging narrative that compels you to investigate and play\r\n- Immersive websites and pages that closely resemble their real-life counterparts## Cons\r\n-The game is linear, only gives you an illusion of choice.\r\n-Gameplay wise, it's not really that deep\r\n-English translation degrades as the game progresses\r\nCyber Manhunt is a PC hacking-themed game that has recently made its way onto the Android platform, offering players an immersive experience as they step into the shoes of a skilled hacker, recently hired by a corporation. I was able to test a trial version of the game, and play the prologue plus the first mission.\r\nWith its focus on an accurate but toned down depiction of hacking, social engineering, and a complex storyline, this game aims to immerse players who enjoy delving into the depths of cyber espionage, as well as educate them in the dangers of the cyber world. The game is clearly inspired by similar games such as Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You, having the same gameplay elements which revolves around using an operating system to investigate people — the only difference is access is not automatically granted to you, and you have to utilize hacking in order to gain access to more information.\r\nThe main gameplay is set in the OS of the computer itself: opening applications, and browsing around the simulated internet of the game. At its core, Cyber Manhunt provides players with a range of hacking-related activities to undertake. Starting with web searches and browsing to collect basic information about targets, players can then utilize a comprehensive database to gain deeper insights about persons of interest.\r\nA cracking software to discover and exploit passwords to access various accounts across different platforms. Hijacking social network and email accounts, requiring players to engage in email threads, conversations, and even phone calls with targets while maintaining a disguise and utilizing gathered information to build trust.\r\nThe game also introduces picture analysis of data extracted from the web, such as from news articles and social media sites, allowing players to extract valuable information and uncover relevant clues. Additionally, the phishing mechanic lets players employ clever tactics by sending phishing links to hack the targets' hardware devices, as well as social engineering them to activate said phishing links, further expanding the range of hacking methods available.\r\nThe whole setup is really streamlined, offering a casual yet still challenging and somewhat accurate depiction. The process of discovering information, such as usernames, emails, and passwords, and using them on apps is simply done through a drag-and-drop operation. There is no need for typing or excessive guesswork involved. However, for individuals well-versed in hacking, a certain suspension of disbelief is still necessary.\r\nCyber Manhunt excels in providing an immersive experience for players. By assuming the role of a hacker, players become part of a larger narrative, accepting tasks from the company to investigate high profile cases. The game's high level of immersion is enhanced through realistic portrayals of hacking activities and the incorporation of social engineering elements.\r\nThe look and design of most of the software, websites, and articles in Cyber Manhunt are meticulously crafted to closely resemble their real-life counterparts, effectively immersing the player in an authentic cyber world. This attention to detail not only adds to the visual appeal of the game but also enhances the overall immersion, believability, and ease of use of the hacking experience. Still, I feel that the game doesn’t have enough filler content or red herring to provide an even more immersive experience, a common gripe I have with these types of games.\r\nAs a mystery game, Cyber Manhunt is essentially a puzzle adventure game in software disguise. The narrative compels you to investigate, and the process is highly engaging. However, similar to traditional puzzle adventure games, it is possible to exploit this gameplay setup by randomly tapping articles and pages until something relevant comes up. Nevertheless, this approach is not always the solution. You still need to carefully consider your next step and determine which piece of information to provide to specific software or website. The game does not spell out everything for the player.\r\nAt the end of cases, you can infer findings based on the evidence you acquire, and you are given choices on what to deduce. However, the significance of these choices is somewhat undermined because if you select the wrong option, it results in no immediate consequence until you eventually choose the correct one. The game only gives you an illusion of choice.\r\nCyber Manhunt’s translation from PC to mobile touch controls are serviceable, but there are occasions where I had minor control difficulties in navigating the UI clearly designed for mouse with its small font, text boxes, and buttons.\r\nEnglish localization wise, they did a pretty good job at the start — which is what I’ve experienced, but I’ve read reports on the PC version that the translation gets worse as you go deeper into the game. This is bad, especially since the game is heavy on reading. However, there is surprisingly decent voice-acting for character dialogues, as well as voice-overs for phone conversations.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5668346) Originally posted on TapTap.",

You must use your god given ability to overcome obstacles in the form of lamp post-looking guards, retrieve the fish for some reason, and make it back in time to be transported into the next level.\r\nIf there was ever a game that could accurately convey the sensation of traversing the fourth dimension as a fourth dimensional being, Cat of Khronos would undoubtedly be one of the games that can be used as an example.\r\nCat of Khronos gameplay setup involves the timeline representing the flow of time, which is conveniently numbered from 1 onwards — representing each point in time. Ordinary mortals can freely travel between the 3 dimensions, but are stuck traveling the flow of time from 1 onwards only (chronologically)\r\nNot the Cat of Khronos, it can freely choose to travel between different points in time. For example, it can start from number 5, then 6, then go back to 3.\r\nIn each level, the only objective is to retrieve the fish and return to the starting point at the correct time. It’s an easy sounding task that can be easily completed without time-travel shenanigans, but the presence of vigilant guards who pursue the player upon detection and the strict time constraints for a successful return makes things complicated.\r\nThese guards are strategically positioned to impede players from completing levels without cleverly navigating around them using time travel. Success hinges upon meticulous planning, requiring players to think ahead and strategize their moves. Perhaps you'll need to lure a guard away, vanish into the time stream, reappear behind them later, or perhaps you'll need to alert guards at a later time, travel back in time to move freely, and then reemerge at that later moment to evade capture.\r\nPersonally, I found myself grappling with the mechanics of Cat of Khronos as early as the second level. The basic mechanics eventually clicked, and I was able to progress through subsequent levels. Just when I thought I was getting the hang of it, the game would suddenly introduce even more challenging puzzles. Which usually involves a larger level, with more guards and complicated positioning to complete.\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\nFull Review here on Taptap!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5666907) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Watching the battlefield come to life with units subject to the laws of physics and ragdoll is both entertaining and engaging.

In the Early Access PC version, players can expect an extensive selection of over 40 single-player levels that align with this engaging gameplay style.\r\nIn the demo version, there are several other modes seen, such as Encounter, which can be described as a Skirmish edition of the game. In this mode, players have the opportunity to purchase units and items instead of them being predetermined. Additionally, there is the Sandbox mode (disabled in the demo), which grants players the freedom to build their own levels. Lastly, the Multiplayer mode features a unique selection of maps and game modes, including PvP, versus bots, and co-op survival.

Pinpoint selecting objects on the map and issuing direct commands can be frustrating, hindering the overall experience. The floaty camera controls and inconsistent panning and zooming further dampen the gameplay fluidity. These control issues need to be addressed to enhance the overall enjoyment and playability of the game. It also performed unsatisfactorily, even on my Snapdragon 888 Android device, suggesting that it may not be fully playable on average phone specifications.\r\nDespite its control shortcomings, Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator is a solid and entertaining experience for fans of strategy and medieval warfare. The blend of puzzle-like scenarios and strategic decision-making keeps players engaged, while the physics-based combat injects a sense of fun and unpredictability. With further improvements to the controls, this game has the potential to become a standout in the physics-based warfare simulator genre.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5671800) Originally posted on TapTap.",

You must use your god given ability to overcome obstacles in the form of lamp post-looking guards, retrieve the fish for some reason, and make it back in time to be transported into the next level.\r\nThe game centers around the enigmatic Cat of Khronos, as it embarks on an adventure through time and the mortal world. The intentionally vague plot mirrors the perplexing time-travel mechanics, but no matter — the true highlight lies in the mind-bending puzzles. These puzzles are uniquely engaging and thought-provoking, ensuring that players are both boggled and challenged throughout their journey.\r\nCat of Khronos itself is actually in 2D isometric view, and features retro-style pixel graphics, an equally classic adventure style soundtrack that fits the puzzle and time mystery aspects of the game, but the game mechanics themselves can be described as “4D”.\r\nIf there was ever a game that could accurately convey the sensation of traversing the fourth dimension as a fourth dimensional being, Cat of Khronos would undoubtedly be one of the games that can be used as an example.\r\nCat of Khronos gameplay setup involves the timeline representing the flow of time, which is conveniently numbered from 1 onwards — representing each point in time.

From the mortal’s point of view, you will be popping out of nowhere and disappearing, then popping back in another place moments later. The Cat is still bound by the three-dimensional laws of physics and can only move step by step within three-dimensional space.. In short, it may appear to teleport from a mortal’s point of view, but it cannot teleport.  This intriguing combination of time travel and spatial movement adds complexity to the gameplay mechanics.\r\nIn each level, the only objective is to retrieve the fish and return to the starting point at the correct time.

Perhaps you'll need to lure a guard away, vanish into the time stream, reappear behind them later, or perhaps you'll need to alert guards at a later time, travel back in time to move freely, and then reemerge at that later moment to evade capture.\r\nIt’s really confusing, but immensely satisfying to pull off once everything falls into place and you successfully solve the levels. The inclusion of a \"Mortal's View\" replay at the end of each level helps a lot in making sense of the 4D puzzle you just solved.\r\nPersonally, I found myself grappling with the mechanics as early as the second level. The basic mechanics eventually clicked, and I was able to progress through subsequent levels. Just when I thought I was getting the hang of it, the game would suddenly introduce even more challenging puzzles. Which usually involves a larger level, with more guards and complicated positioning to complete. This cycle goes on and on for the entirety of the game, continuously providing players with a satisfying increase of level in difficulty, but admittedly it lacks variety in the form of more obstacles or elements other than guards to avoid.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5666893) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dwerve is a captivating blend of retro art dungeon crawling RPG and tower defense combat, enveloped in a high fantasy narrative featuring Dwarves, Elves, and Trolls. Recently released for PC, with a mobile version on the horizon, I had the opportunity to test the demo version called Dwerve: Prologue.\r\nThe gameplay in Dwerve is straightforward yet involves the player strategically. Players traverse the land, engaging in battles against monsters and solving puzzles along the way, in some occasions navigating maze-like levels and activating levers to open gates. The map design exhibits cleverness in multiple aspects, notably in minimizing the need for excessive backtracking during quests. However, the standout feature that sets Dwerve apart from other retro RPG games lies in its combat system.\r\nThe combat is infused with tower defense combat system that is tantamount to the Dwerve’s survival. Using his magical stones, he can place structures from a current lineup of four, on any empty tile on the land, significantly increasing his defensive and offensive capabilities. These structures range from spin blade turrets, dealing devastating melee damage in an area of effect, to crossbow turrets, capable of delivering precise, long-range attacks.\r\nAs the game progresses, additional structures and turrets can be unlocked, further expanding players' tactical options. While these structures possess limited health or duration, they can be seamlessly recalled and rebuilt in an instant, as long as the player retrieves back the magical stones. As he progresses, the protagonist also acquires coins that can be used to purchase upgrades for his towers, such as increased damage or durability.\r\nThe gameplay is interesting, however it's not without its flaws. From the PC to mobile controls, the touchscreen controls have some form of unresponsiveness. I’ve experienced being unable to move multiple times already while in combat and frantically building turrets, leading to an unwarranted death multiple times. It doesn’t help that the checkpoint/save system is bound to frustrate players too, which doesn’t allow for manual saving and restarts the entire level if ever you decide, or accidentally leave the instance.\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5669379) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Originally released for PC, an Android port is now coming soon and I was able to test this version out.\r\nYou wake up in a mansion, a former research center that has now transformed into a labyrinth teeming with menacing zombies and treacherous traps. In order to survive, you must face these dangers, gather items, solve puzzles, all while revealing a mysterious storyline that unfolds gradually as they explore the mansion and uncover hidden documents and diaries. The narrative is intriguing, as players piece together the events that led to the mansion's current state and their own presence within it. While the story is not overly complex, it provides enough motivation to drive players forward\r\nAt the start, you can easily tell that this game is inspired by the classic Resident Evil games. The typewriter sound bits used to open the survival story, as well as the gameplay mechanics upon the start of the gameplay confirmed my suspicions. Even the menus, item combination system, safe room storage box, heart rate graph indicating health, and healing herbs are all ripped straight from classic Resident Evil.\r\nThe game's overall feel not only pays homage to the classic survival horror games of the past but also adds a certain charm and nostalgia with its chibi-looking characters. The environments capture the essence of a creepy mansion with dark corridors, dimly lit rooms, and ominous ambiance.\r\nHeaven Dust offers a mix of puzzle-solving, exploration, and zombie survival, creating a well-rounded gameplay experience that we are all familiar with. As you navigate through the mansion in an isometric view, you'll encounter various puzzles and riddles that require observation, critical thinking, and item combination/manipulation to progress. The puzzles are well-designed and logical, offering a good balance of head scratching and satisfaction.\r\nThe combat in Heaven Dust is reminiscent of the shooting system in Resident Evil, you just equip the weapon, raise it up, and click at the zombies you'll frequently encounter throughout the mansion. While combat mechanics are relatively straightforward, they require strategic positioning and resource management to overcome the undead.\r\nAmmunition and health items are limited, adding an element of tension and forcing players to carefully consider their actions. However, some players have found the controls to be a bit clunky, and the portrait view of the game a bit limiting, particularly when moving around and trying to get by on a very limited horizontal view. While the PC and Switch versions offered controller support, this title surprisingly did not when I tested my Xbox Controller on it, despite the tutorial still showing gamepad layouts to the player.\r\nThe exploration aspect of the game is rewarding, with secrets and hidden items scattered throughout the mansion. The zoomed out isometric camera slightly helps in making this game a bit accessible, as you can easily see rooms even across walls and closed doors. Backtracking is often necessary to unlock new areas or access previously inaccessible rooms, which can feel repetitive or disorienting for some players. However, the mansion's layout remains engaging due to its nonlinear labyrinth nature, encouraging players to revisit areas and discover new paths.\r\nHeaven Dust introduces players to a mysterious storyline that unfolds gradually as they explore the mansion and uncover hidden documents and diaries. The narrative is intriguing, as players piece together the events that led to the mansion's current state and their own presence within it. While the story is not overly complex, it provides enough motivation to drive players forward, and the multiple endings based on player choices offer replayability and encourage further exploration.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5687898) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Battle Chasers: Nightwar is an adaptation of Joe Madureira's fantasy comic book series of the same name. Originally released as a PC game, it has been ported to the mobile platforms as well. For the purpose of this review, I will be talking about the Android version.\r\nThe game immerses players in a captivating storyline where the main cast of characters finds themselves stranded on an island. In order to secure their escape, they must embark on a heroic quest to thwart the wicked schemes of an evil sorceress.\r\nThe game's narrative centers around a group of heroes known as the Battle Chasers, who embark on a quest to uncover the secrets of The Lost Vale and rescue a missing friend. As players progress through the game, they unravel the mysteries of the island, encountering intriguing characters, engaging in side quests, and facing formidable bosses. The story is presented through beautifully crafted cutscenes, dialogues, and two levels of exploration gameplay, providing a captivating and immersive experience.\r\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar offers a well-balanced and satisfying gameplay experience, blending various elements seamlessly. Players will need to form a party of three, from five a selection of five characters. During the first five hours, you quickly start off with three party members, and will discover the rest of the crew later on. The game can be divided into three core components: exploration, overworld navigation, and turn-based combat.\r\nHowever, at times, the map design can be slightly confusing, leading to occasional “getting lost” moments and some backtracking. Fortunately, the game provides unlockable teleports to alleviate navigation issues.\r\nOverworld Navigation: The overworld navigation utilizes a point-and-click system, where players select their desired destinations on a hand-drawn cel-shaded campaign map. The artistic aesthetics of the overworld map are visually appealing and contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere. In both the overworld and exploration parts of the game, players will encounter numerous situations that involve making choices, rolling a metaphorical dice, and experiencing corresponding outcomes. These elements instill an added sense of role-playing, where decisions carry risks and rewards that shape the gameplay experience..\r\nTurn-Based Combat: The main highlight of the game is its traditional turn-based combat style, where units take turns attacking or using abilities against each other. The turning queue system is intuitive, allowing you to easily determine the order of actions. Each skill has its own weight in the turn order, influencing their placement. For instance, selecting an Instant skill immediately casts the spell, while choosing Very Fast or Fast puts the character a few steps behind.\r\nOne notable aspect of the combat system is the overcharge mechanic, which accumulates based on the character's chosen attack or ability. This overcharge mechanic can provide additional damage and/or mana for the characters. Moreover, you have the opportunity to build up an ultimate ability charge periodically, which can be utilized by any of the characters.\r\nOverall, aside from being tactical, the combat is flashy, kinetic, and pure fun presentation wise. All the abilities of the characters are well balanced and are all actually usable, depending on the situation. The addition of the overcharge mechanic adds more freedom to the character to perform abilities despite lacking mana.\r\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar also features a robust crafting system that allows players to create powerful equipment and items. Throughout the game, players collect resources and recipes, which can be used to craft and roll enhanced weapons, armor, and consumables. The crafting system adds a greater sense of customization and progression, as players experiment with different combinations to create the most effective gear. It also encourages exploration and resource gathering, providing a rewarding experience outside of combat.\r\nTechnical Details:\r\nTouch Controls: The game is fully adapted to touch controls, but the UI sensitivity can be too sensitive, leading to unintended commands being recognized.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5713676) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Games that delve into unique perspectives and disabilities can offer a fresh and immersive experience, and this particular game leverages blindness as a gameplay mechanic.\r\nThe game features a striking 1-bit graphical style complemented by a straightforward gameplay. Movement is done through the touch joystick, while interactions with objects are handled via the right portion of the touch screen. The visually impaired-focused gameplay adds a layer of challenge and tension, as players cannot see far ahead and must stick to walls, objects, in order to make sense of the environment. Auditory signals like ringing phones or doorbells coupled with visual indications constantly provide references to their respective locations, heightening immersion within the perspective of the blind protagonist.\r\nI See You embraces gameplay elements inspired by the Resident Evil series, while combining 1-bit graphics with visually impaired-focused mechanics. Save points take the form of typewriters, while puzzle-solving involves collecting various items such as keys and components to craft more complex objects like batteries or handgun ammunition.\r\nMy experience was limited to a short portion of the game, and it should be noted that the game is still a work in progress. Unfortunately, there were constant crashes during item pickups, which hindered my ability to thoroughly enjoy even the beta test. Nevertheless, the game shows promise, particularly with its novel visually impaired mechanics in 1 bit style format. The combination of survival horror elements with this unique perspective creates a genuinely new experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5716406) Originally posted on TapTap.",

However, it blends retro aesthetics with modern gameplay elements such as a physics system and twin stick controls. The game is already available on PC and Switch, but I was able to try out the Android demo version of the game, bringing the arcade shooter into the mobile platform.\r\nThe combat system in Strike Buster Prototype centers around combo accumulation, making it a vital component of the gameplay. Players must string together successive kills to build and maintain their combo meter. As combos increase, so does the power of the player's weapon, creating a satisfying feedback loop that rewards precision, consistency, and skill. It's immensely gratifying to see your weapon grow stronger with each successful combo, allowing you to dispatch enemies with even greater efficiency.\r\nThe game's weapon type system further elevates the strategic depth. Each enemy — most of the time in groups — has a specific color-coded  weakness to a particular weapon type, requiring players to constantly switch weapons in the heat of combat. This decision adds a layer of tactics and forces players to think on their feet, as they must quickly assess the enemy types they encounter and switch weapons accordingly.\r\nMuch like the classic arcade games it pays homage to, Strike Buster Prototype doesn't pull any punches. It challenges players to master its mechanics, learn enemy patterns, and hone their reflexes. Every encounter feels like a nail-biting test of skill, especially with the physics settings in effect when colliding and bouncing around enemies, making victory all the more rewarding. While it may frustrate some players initially, those who persevere will find a deeply satisfying sense of accomplishment as they improve and climb up the high scores.\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5719362) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Refactor\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nRefactor is a roguelike tower defense game featuring a Tetris-like building system and refreshing twists to the tower defense genre.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique but familiar Tetris-like building system\r\n- Innovative tower defense mechanics\r\n- Risk-and-reward resource management elements\r\n- Nostalgic Visual and Audio Experience## Cons\r\n-It’s mind-bending difficulty might not be for everyone\r\n-Story is basically as basic as it gets\r\nIn Refactor, Aliens are invading Earth, and you have to defend the planet by building elemental turrets. That's basically the background story. Now that's out of the way, the main focus here is the hardcore-style tower defense combat with innovative building elements, where you are also in charge of constructing the pathway of the enemies. Originally released for PC last year, I was able to try out the Android demo version of the game.\r\nAt the core of Refactor lies its dynamic block building system, reminiscent of the popular puzzle game Tetris. Players are tasked with strategically arranging levels and pathways to create an effective defense against the invading forces. The enemy will automatically take the shortest path from start to end, and the game disallows you to block off the path entirely.\r\nHowever, You can extend this route by using the blocks to create new pathways and turrets to block shortcuts. This system adds a layer of puzzle-solving to the gameplay, requiring players to think tactically and make careful decisions about placement and structure. With the randomized Tetris-shapes used for building, and using turrets to block off pathways, coming up with an optimal layout suddenly becomes a challenging task, especially for harder attack waves.\r\nThe building system in Refactor is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing players to easily manipulate and rotate pieces to fit together seamlessly, just like Tetris. The satisfaction of creating a well-designed defense that efficiently repels enemy attacks while taking them the longest route possible is immensely gratifying. The Tetris-inspired element of the game brings a unique and enjoyable aspect to the tower defense genre.\r\nTo place turrets, you must purchase turret modules from the shop, including the Tetris-shaped block that comes with it and the roster of turret modules are randomly selected after each wave. Players must carefully allocate their resources to purchase additional turret modules and upgrades for their defense. The turrets are divided into five elemental affinities:  Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth. with varying numbered levels of quality, and players can use gold to upgrade the quality of turrets.\r\nOne notable aspect of Refactor is the gradual increase in module prices over time, simulating an inflation mechanic. This adds a sense of urgency and forces players to make strategic decisions about when and how much to invest in upgrades. It creates a compelling risk-reward dynamic, it's a matter of balancing the right amount of upgrades per wave ratio, if you upgrade too much that it's overkill, it would be a waste of gold. If you barely upgrade to save gold, then you risk losing. This adds a resource management aspect toRefactor that adds depth and complexity to the gameplay.\r\nThe highlight of Refactor is undoubtedly the innovative Refactor mechanic, which dynamically gives you a random selection of Refactor recipes every wave that you can follow to fuse turrets into a more powerful version. With a staggering 35 elemental combinations available, the possibilities for experimentation and strategic thinking are vast — especially that you can stock turrets on top of each other for increased power at the cost of losing quantity. Trying out new refactor recipes and unlocking powerful turret combinations becomes an exciting pursuit, encouraging players to constantly adapt and evolve their defense strategy.\r\nVisually, Refactor is a treat for the eyes. The game features vibrant and detailed neon-like retro graphics, with each element and turret design visually distinct by color and shape. In terms of audio, Refactor delivers an atmospheric retro soundtrack that complements the gameplay as well. The satisfying low-fi blast of turrets and the explosions of defeated enemies, add an extra layer of excitement plus nostalgia.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5718791) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Strike Buster Prototype\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nGameplay\r\nStrike Buster Prototype is a retro style arcade game featuring combo-based combat and twin-stick shooter controls.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A good balance of retro aesthetic and modern look\r\n- Amazing rhythmic beat sound effects for the weapons\r\n- Weapon type system that encourages experimentation and constant switching## Cons\r\n-No story\r\nPlaying Strike Buster Prototype, it definitely reminded me of the retro arcade space shoot ‘em ups I’ve played in my childhood during my PS1 days, such as Ray Crisis and Einhander. However, it blends retro aesthetics with modern gameplay elements such as a physics system and twin stick controls. The game is already available on PC and Switch, but I was able to try out the Android demo version of the game, bringing the arcade shooter into the mobile platform.\r\nAt first glance, Strike Buster Prototype captures the essence of classic arcade games, even going back further in time — way past my PS1 days — to the 80s with its vibrant pixel art and nostalgic sound effects. The visuals are a delightful throwback, bringing back memories of arcade cabinets, classic home consoles, and neon-lit gaming halls. However, the game quickly reveals its modern influences through its innovative mechanics and gameplay depth.\r\nWith its focus on high scores, combo accumulation, and weapon switching, this game offers an addictive but still challenging gameplay loop that will keep players coming back for more.\r\nThe combat system in Strike Buster Prototype centers around combo accumulation, making it a vital component of the gameplay. Players must string together successive kills to build and maintain their combo meter. As combos increase, so does the power of the player's weapon, creating a satisfying feedback loop that rewards precision, consistency, and skill. It's immensely gratifying to see your weapon grow stronger with each successful combo, allowing you to dispatch enemies with even greater efficiency.\r\nThe game's weapon type system further elevates the strategic depth. Each enemy — most of the time in groups — has a specific color-coded weakness to a particular weapon type, requiring players to constantly switch weapons in the heat of combat. This decision adds a layer of tactics and forces players to think on their feet, as they must quickly assess the enemy types they encounter and switch weapons accordingly.\r\nEnemies come in many forms and go after you wave after wave. There is a timer that, when it ends, a boss will arrive and a fight will ensue. These bosses are filled with random affinities that affect their characteristics and abilities, and they constantly change armor types, forcing players to switch weapons. Overall, they are still fairly challenging in my experience.\r\nThe weapon type system encourages experimentation and adaptability, ensuring that all weapons must be used across the board, regardless of the player preference. It adds a welcome layer of variety and replayability to the game, keeping players engaged and on their toes. In addition, weapons overheat, so you must carefully balance combo, weapons switching, and use to be at your most effective.\r\nMuch like the classic arcade games it pays homage to, this title doesn't pull any punches. It challenges players to master its mechanics, learn enemy patterns, and hone their reflexes. Every encounter feels like a nail-biting test of skill, especially with the physics settings in effect when colliding and bouncing around enemies, making victory all the more rewarding. While it may frustrate some players initially, those who persevere will find a deeply satisfying sense of accomplishment as they improve and climb up the high scores.\r\nIn terms of presentation, Strike Buster Prototype nails a good balance of retro aesthetic and modern look. The pixel art is vibrant and detailed, evoking a sense of nostalgia, however not everything is retro-looking. Special effects are more sleek and clean looking, while the UI and Menus are also in much higher fidelity. The soundtrack complements the gameplay perfectly, capturing the energetic and adrenaline-fueled spirit of classic arcade shooters. The sound effects of the weapons and enemies dying, are insanely good, they even have their own musical beat going on that compliments that background music perfectly like a rhythm-based game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5719379) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Developed by Indie devs Rayka Studio, this title offers a plethora of engaging features, diverse character choices, and waifu characters. Surprisingly, it’s not a gacha game!\r\nPrime of Flames was recently released for PC last December, but it is also expanding to mobile devices soon and I was able to try out the recent Android port of the game. This means that players will now have the opportunity to engage with the game's captivating turn-based tactics, diverse character roster, and enjoyable team-building mechanics wherever they are.\r\nThe game's art style is a harmonious fusion of clean looking hand-painted aesthetics and anime-inspired character design mostly featuring waifus. The beautifully crafted environments, vibrant character designs, and the clever use of animated cutout graphics creates a visually stunning world that resembles something that has come to life from a card game or tabletop game.\r\nThe core gameplay mechanics of Prime of Flames revolve around turn-based tactics, where players strategically place and maneuver their characters in a grid-based map to overcome various enemies. The combat system is very well designed, and is very intuitive in how it works. Different characters will have different attack types, ranges, and mannerisms. For example, Guard characters can protect their teammates, suddenly swapping places with their allies taking damage on their behalf, Some warriors can go berserk, granted with increased damage at the cost of being uncommandable, while Hunter or Priest characters can attack from a varying degrees of long ranges.\r\nThe game truly shines with its extensive character roster, reaching waifu-level proportions, featuring an impressive array of characters across three distinct factions. Each character possesses unique skills and abilities, and their selection significantly impacts the gameplay.\r\nThe absence of individual character leveling and itemization is an interesting design choice. Instead, party experience levels determine the maximum number of characters in the party. However, you cannot bring everyone into battles, which will mostly have you select a few only, usually 4 more or less. Items are equipped by the party and shared, which completely removes tedious character gear-ups and focuses on the growth and progression of the entire party rather than individual characters.\r\nThis approach adds a strategic element, forcing players to carefully choose their team composition for each encounter. It also encourages synergy and cooperation among characters, fostering a sense of teamwork and creating opportunities for engaging combinations and strategies.\r\nCharacter progression is handled through the party's overall experience level, which unlocks random skills and upgrades for each character from their class. This system introduces an exciting sense of roguelike unpredictability and variety, keeping players engaged as they choose new abilities and upgrades. It encourages experimentation and adaptability, enabling players to customize their characters and tailor their playstyle to their preferences each run. As part of being roguelike, the game restarts from scratch when failing. Nevertheless, the game has some form of persistent progression in the form of upgrading camps, however this camp mechanic is not included in the version that I have tested for now.\r\nThe campaign structure of Prime of Flames follows a branching node system, offering players choices and non-linear progression. The ability to backtrack and revisit previous nodes instead of being constrained to a linear path enhances the freedom and player agency. This design choice allows for exploration and encourages players to fully immerse themselves in the game's rich world.\r\nAside from the battles, the game presents a plethora of engaging encounters. Traders offer opportunities to acquire valuable items and resources, while healing fountains provide much-needed restoration. Some nodes provide bonuses such as temporary buffs or upgrade choices, adding strategic considerations to decision-making. Caravans, which can be paid for, offer the convenience of skipping nodes, speeding up progression. These role-playing elements add depth, variety, and a touch of personality to the gameplay, further enriching the experience.\r\nWhile Prime of Flames delivers a fantastic gameplay experience mechanically, it is worth noting that the English text translation occasionally suffers from inconsistencies and spotty translations. This can result in moments of confusion and affect the understanding of certain mechanics. However, the captivating gameplay mechanics and engaging encounters overshadow any minor translation issues, players just have to experiment more and try.\r\nThe narrative, while not the central focus, complements the gameplay and provides a backdrop for the player's journey. Though the story may be forgettable, the rich gameplay and the opportunities for exploration and character growth compensate for any narrative shortcomings.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5718338) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Now that's out of the way, the main focus here is the hardcore-style tower defense combat with innovative building elements, where you are also in charge of constructing the pathway of the enemies. Originally released for PC last year, I was able to try out the Android demo version of the game.\r\nAt the core of Refactor lies its dynamic block building system, reminiscent of the popular puzzle game Tetris. Players are tasked with strategically arranging levels and pathways to create an effective defense against the invading forces. The enemy will automatically take the shortest path from start to end, and the game disallows you to block off the path entirely.\r\nHowever, you can extend this route by using the blocks to create new pathways and turrets to block shortcuts. This system adds a layer of puzzle-solving to the gameplay, requiring players to think tactically and make careful decisions about placement and structure. With the randomized Tetris-shapes used for building, and using turrets to block off pathways, coming up with an optimal layout suddenly becomes a challenging task, especially for harder attack waves.\r\nThe highlight of Refactor is undoubtedly the innovative Refactor mechanic, which dynamically gives you a random selection of Refactor recipes every wave that you can follow to fuse turrets into a more powerful version. With a staggering 35 elemental combinations available, the possibilities for experimentation and strategic thinking are vast — especially that you can stock turrets on top of each other for increased power at the cost of losing quantity. Trying out new refactor recipes and unlocking powerful turret combinations becomes an exciting pursuit, encouraging players to constantly adapt and evolve their defense strategy.\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5718767) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game features a gacha system for unlocking and acquiring new heroes, each with their own unique traits and tiers.\r\nCurrently in closed beta testing for the PC and Android platforms starting today, I had the opportunity to try out the PC version for a quick spin.\r\nIt almost started out like an Isekai-type story, with the protagonist waking up in the middle of the \"containment zone\". Thankfully, it isn't that way. Now we have an in-universe protagonist with a real background story. However, there is still a mystery that players have to unravel.\r\nAs an Adjutant, players have the opportunity to unlock and choose from a diverse selection of waifu heroes with various skills, gun types, and abilities. These weapon options include assault rifles, submachine guns, close-range shotguns, and sniper rifles, allowing players to tailor their gameplay style to their preferences.\r\nUpon starting the game as a new player, you are already provided with three basic characters in the first few minutes, as well as trying out other hero types.

The seamless switching between squad members and the option to call for support during combat adds a layer of strategy and variety to gameplay.\r\nThe combat in Snowbreak: Containment Zone is highly satisfying, with responsive gunplay and impactful hits against enemies.

The variety of weapon types, such as assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles, cater to different synergistic playstyles and allow players to adapt their approach to different combat situations.\r\nAs a gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, and premium currency. Of course, not everything here is final but currently the gacha rates are too low for now. If you love collecting the best of the best characters, this might become a deal breaker.

The game features a gacha system for unlocking and acquiring new heroes, each with their own unique traits and tiers.\r\nCurrently in closed beta testing for the PC and Mobile platforms starting today, I had the opportunity to try out the PC version for a quick spin. Powered by Unreal Engine 4, the game provides stunning visuals, AAA level of graphics mixed with an anime art-style, and dynamic environments that immerse players in a freezing barren city.\r\nThe game's storyline is set in the near future, after the catastrophic event known as the \"First Descent\" in 2057. This event brought about the Titans, immense beings that ravaged the city, leaving behind only a desolate wasteland. In response, a select few individuals known as the Manifestations were discovered. These individuals possess the essence of the Gods and are recruited into the Heimdall Force, a specialized paramilitary organization created to combat the Titans.\r\nIt almost started out like an Isekai-type story, with the protagonist waking up in the middle of the \"containment zone\". Thankfully, it isn't that way. Now we have an in-universe protagonist with a real background story. However, there is still a mystery that players have to unravel.\r\nThe game’s cutscenes are fully voiced in English, however, for many of the story elements, it is still running on text-based dialogue in which I hope it is only temporary. It also features anime inspired music that keeps players pumped during gameplay.\r\nAs an Adjutant, players have the opportunity to unlock and choose from a diverse selection of waifu heroes with various skills, gun types, and abilities. These weapon options include assault rifles, submachine guns, close-range shotguns, and sniper rifles, allowing players to tailor their gameplay style to their preferences.\r\nThe heroes and weapons are unlocked in a gacha-style manner, where players have a chance to acquire them through randomized draws. Different tiers are available, even for the same characters, providing a sense of rarity and collectibility. This system adds an element of excitement and anticipation as players strive to obtain higher-tier heroes to enhance their squad.\r\nUpon starting the game as a new player, you are already provided with three basic characters in the first few minutes, as well as trying out other hero types.

The game's weakness is in the enemy AI, which can be somewhat stale and lack energy, which honestly isn’t really an issue with these mindless PvE shooter types of games, and this is counteracted by the many different types of enemies that can force players to try out a different approach for each type.\r\nThere are many activities in Snowbreak, one example is the Operations where you can target specific farming like currency, resources, and materials; and of course, playing the Main Story missions which are divided into chapters. These chapters consist of a combination of combat missions and visual novel-style cutscenes.\r\nAs a gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, and premium currency.

Myth: Gods of Asgard also features full-on voice acting, what I liked from this game is that despite the compelling story, the cutscenes and dialogue are short and are minimal. It jumps straight to the hack and slash actions for the most part.\r\nThe gacha system in Myth: Gods of Asgard revolves around Divine Powers, allowing players to summon mighty gods from Norse mythology for assistance in combat or to receive their blessings, enhancing skill effects. Each hero possesses a unique set of skills, and it becomes crucial to strategically utilize Divine Power to improve combat power and overall gameplay experience. While Divine Powers can be obtained through the gacha system, players also have the option to gradually acquire them by farming shards.\r\nCombat system is simply amazing. Players can perform a combination of normal and powerful attacks, execute special moves, and dodge or dash to avoid incoming enemy attacks. The combat is a finely tuned and thrilling intense experience; fluid, kinetic, flashy, and visually stunning.\r\nFor the main story campaign, it revolves around clearing dungeons one after the other, and facing various bosses with their own style of attacks and difficulties. Not only dying can result in failure, but also there is a timer for some missions. Even if you can skillfully avoid enemy and boss attacks and slowly chip their health to death, you will still fail if you take too much time. The boss fight design is the spongy type with too many health points, and by the second chapter you already need to tinker around with the items, talent tree, and divine powers to be able to survive or kill them on time.\r\nA surprising but welcome feature for an actively controlled ARPG game, Myth: Gods of Asgard also includes auto-game mode for idle gameplay and stress-free farming. The AI powering the auto-game mode is competent (the same one used for the asymmetric multiplayer Arena mode), letting you clear missions relatively well. Still, player control is the more superior option.\r\nAs a live service game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, in-game purchases and the aforementioned gacha system. In my experience, the free-to-play experience in this game is playable enough for me, especially with the generous free gifts to the player, albeit a little challenging than outright spending money.\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\nRead the Full Review here on Taptap!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5737143) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Myth: Gods of Asgard features full-on voice acting, though the acting can be a bit cheesy, and the accents may be exaggerated for my personal taste. What I liked from this game is that despite the compelling story, the cutscenes and dialogue are short and are minimal. It jumps straight to the hack and slash actions for the most part.\r\nUnlike other gacha games where the main element is collecting hundreds of heroic characters. There are only five heroes instead, based on Norse mythology that you can unlock and use, including Thor and Siegfried.\r\nThe gacha system in Myth: Gods of Asgard revolves around Divine Powers, allowing players to summon mighty gods from Norse mythology for assistance in combat or to receive their blessings, enhancing skill effects.

However, while the combat mechanics are executed smoothly, I noticed there are performance issues that detract from the experience. Constant framerate drops occur when there are numerous effects and units on the screen, even on my Snapdragon 888 gaming phone. It doesn’t help that there are only three settings for the graphics and performance: High Frame Rate, Normal Frame Rate, and Auto.\r\nThe asymmetric multiplayer aspect is done amazingly, with the players able to challenge other players’ characters 24/7, controlled by an automated AI (which I will talk about later on), no need to battle it out with real controller heroes, just their heroes controlled by AI, which, as it may already be evident, heavily relies on the heroes’ stats and not player skill.\r\nFor the main story campaign, it revolves around clearing dungeons one after the other, and facing various bosses with their own style of attacks and difficulties.

The boss fight design is the spongy type with too many health points, and by the second chapter you already need to tinker around with the items, talent tree, and divine powers to be able to survive or kill them on time.\r\nA surprising but welcome feature for an actively controlled ARPG game, Myth: Gods of Asgard also includes auto-game mode for idle gameplay and stress-free farming. The AI powering the auto-game mode is competent (the same one used for the asymmetric multiplayer Arena mode), letting you clear missions relatively well. Still, player control is the more superior option.\r\nAs a live service game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, in-game purchases and the aforementioned gacha system. In my experience, the free-to-play experience in this game is playable enough for me, especially with the generous free gifts to the player, albeit a little challenging than outright spending money.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5737185) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Everdream Valley\r\nEverdream Valley is a third person farming sim developed for the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, this game offers a refreshing and immersive experience across multiple platforms.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Diverse variety of crops, and adds animals to the mix\r\n- Dream mechanic for the animals and sleeping\r\n- A sense of exploration and Discovery\r\n- Charming art style and relaxing music## Cons\r\n-Quality of Life issues\r\n-Harvesting needs some work to be more enjoyable instead of repetitive\r\nEverdream Valley is a delightful and lighthearted farming adventure game that combines the joys of tending to a homestead with farming, animals, and magic. Following in the footsteps of farming games like Dinkum and Stardew Valley; Everdream Valley promises to be another solid addition to the farming sim genre.\r\nFrom the moment you step foot into the beautiful Everdream Valley, you'll be captivated by its vibrant and magical atmosphere. The visuals are simply artistic, with lush landscapes, charming characters, animals, and a lighthearted child-friendly tone all throughout. The soothing soundtrack further enhances the immersion, creating a serene and inviting ambiance as you embark on your relaxing farming journey.\r\nIn Everdream Valley, you find yourself on your grandparents' neglected farm, ready to breathe new life into it. The game presents you with the opportunity to clean up the farm, help your grandparents, bring back the animals, and embark on quests that serve as both the story and introduction to the game’s mechanics. Although you can entirely do things at your own pace.\r\nThe quest system in Everdream Valley offers a structured path to follow while also allowing for some flexibility and exploration. The quests serve as a roadmap, leading you through the necessary steps to make meaningful progress. However, there may be times when you receive quests that require access to areas you haven't unlocked yet. In these situations, the game encourages you to focus on other available quests or activities to continue making progress. This approach allows players to tackle tasks at their own pace and explore the game's world more freely.\r\nThere is a lot to do in this game. Starting with the variety of animals: The game offers a decent variety of animals; cows, chickens, deers, sheep, fish, and dogs to engage with. There are different tiers of animal breeds to provide a sense of progression and variety, allowing players to choose their preferred level of complexity in animal management. Everdream Valley lets you have a pet dog from a variety of choices, the game lets you train it, play with it, or pet it.\r\nEverdream Valley also introduces a captivating dream mechanic later on that allows you to assume the role of any of your farm animals during the night in a mini-game fashion. In these dreams, your objective is to protect your animals from a menacing wolfpack. Exploring the dream world uncovers hidden content and quests..\r\nAs for the farming, Everdream Valley offers the traditional variety of fruits and vegetables for you to cultivate, allowing you to create a bountiful and diverse harvest on your farm. From raspberries to apples and everything in between, the game provides a wide range of crops to cultivate and protect. I also love how the game allows you to easily move and customize trees and crops, giving you the freedom to design and rearrange your farm to your liking. However, harvesting isn’t as pleasing and satisfying as I thought it would be, to the point of being annoying and feeling like a chore to do, instead of having that rhythmic and meditative quality to it like other farming sims.\r\nYou are not just an “animal whisperer\" or a farmer though, and you can also engage in other activities such as being a carpenter or engineer, crafting and making structures, you can also be a fisherman, beekeeper, miner, breeder, and many more professions involving farm work aside from farming and cultivating crops. Some of the activities have mini-games of their own as well, such as cutting wood or cooking.\r\nEverdream Valley adopts a slow-paced gameplay style, giving players ample time to complete tasks, explore the world, and engage in various activities. The leisurely passing of days creates a relaxed atmosphere, allowing players to immerse themselves fully in the farming experience. They can end the day at any time by sleeping in the house to pass the time.\r\nThere is a cooking system that comes with a mini-game as well. Initially, stamina is annoyingly limited, but as you unlock cooking recipes, you can expand your stamina pool. This gradual increase in stamina provides a sense of progression and allows you to undertake more tasks each day, enhancing your efficiency and productivity. However, I can’t help but get frustrated by this system that limits my play, considering the map is big and the game requires you to constantly jump around it. A minor gripe, but I also don’t like how your movement is constantly impeded by bushes and plants.\r\nExploring the game's world is rewarded with the discovery of valuable items and resources needed for future building projects even for free. This incentivizes players to venture beyond their immediate surroundings and uncover hidden treasures and maybe even quests. I have a minor gripe about the map system, and how frustrating it is to use when you are running and opening the map at the same time, leading to unintentional movements of the map, as pressing the \"W\" key while running causes it to shift upwards.\r\nThese kinds of issues are prevalent throughout the game, and Everdream Valley is really in dire need of a QoL (Quality of Life) makeover. From core game mechanics like harvesting crops or cooking recipes to simple things like inventory management, the stamina system, or even something as trivial as the aforementioned map system, many aspects require significant improvements to create a solid gaming experience and eliminate any pain points.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5761728) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Street Fighter™ 6\r\nStreet Fighter 6 is a 2023 fighting game developed and published by Capcom and the sixth main entry in the Street Fighter franchise, it was recently released and now available for PC, Playstation, and Xbox.\r\n## Pros\r\n- The action-packed catchy soundtrack\r\n- World Tour single player “RPG” game mode\r\n- A new stellar mechanic called the Drive System\r\n- Very newcomer friendly with new control mechanics\r\n- Commentary option capturing the feel of a highly competing esports environment## Cons\r\n-Story is lackluster\r\n-World Tour progression is grindy\r\nStreet Fighter 6 has come a long way. It features a 18-character roster of both new and returning fighters rendered in new Full 3D art style that looks much closer now to contemporaries like Tekken, than the classic 2D or artistic visuals of Street Fighter, however, the spirit of Street Fighter is still felt here. Street Fighter 6’s roster of 18 characters is mostly familiar, with 12 returning characters and six being entirely new.\r\nOne of the first things that grabs your attention in Street Fighter 6 is its visual presentation. The transition from the classic 2D art style to a Full 3D rendering is a breath of fresh air, bringing the game in line with its contemporary peers. The character models are even more detailed now, showcasing intricate details bolstered by smooth animations and vibrant special effects. As a result, the characters do look bigger compared to previous games, there’s something with the camera and the 3D graphics that made it look that way — which can be a turnoff for some.\r\nThe sound design in Street Fighter 6 is nothing short of spectacular. The action-packed catchy soundtrack perfectly complements the frenetic battles, pumping adrenaline through your veins all throughout starting from the introduction, battle, and outcome. The sound effects are impactful and satisfying, capturing the weight and impact of each move. There is also a commentary option to make battles feel more bigger than they are, capturing the feel of a highly competing esports environment, without having to be in one. From the clash of fists to the close calls, the audio immersion enhances the overall experience, keeping you engaged and on the edge of your seat.\r\nWhether it's the returning fan-favorites or the 6 new additions, each fighter feels distinct and vibrant. Street Fighter 6 strikes a balance between modern visuals and the series' timeless aesthetic, successfully capturing the spirit of the franchise.\r\nStreet Fighter 6 offers an impressive array of game modes that cater to both single-player enthusiasts and online warriors. The main single player component is the ambitious World Tour, which transforms the game into a sprawling RPG experience. As a created character, you embark on a journey, becoming a disciple of the main characters, learning their moves, and building your skills. Despite some shortcomings in the story and the protagonist's presence, the immersive gameplay, customization options, and gradual introduction to Street Fighter fundamentals make the World Tour a captivating experience.\r\nWhile the story is kind of lame with its writing reaching parody levels of ridiculousness, and the concept of having a created character feels dull with its muted protagonist nature, the actual gameplay is immersive, especially with the customization and personalization you can have with your character – considering you can mix and match the moves of every character. It also does a decent job of introducing newcomers to the basics of Street Fighter 6 by slowly giving them side quests as he progresses throughout the 20 hour or so story . Although you can't have your cake and eat it too, as the grinding takes a lot of time, to be able to acquire character moves.\r\nFortunately, the player-created RPG character is not limited to the world tour game mode alone. You have the freedom to play your character, along with all the gear they have acquired, to the online Battle Hub. This hub serves as a bustling online social space where you can participate in both ranked and unranked matchmaking, engaging in thrilling battles with players from around the world. Whether you prefer ranked matches or unranked casual bouts, the Battle Hub ensures that there's always a challenge waiting.\r\nJust like other games before it, Street Fighter 6 adds new mechanics that make it a compelling fighting game, more specifically, it adds something called the Drive System. Every character gains access to five powerful abilities that are all governed by their Drive Gauge: Overdrive special moves, Drive Rush, Drive Parry, Drive Reversals, and Drive Impact. plus a Burnout mechanic if the drive gauge runs out where drive abilities are more dangerous to you.\r\nOverdrives are Special Moves, while Drive Rush allows you to quickly close the gap between you and your opponent, Drive Reversals allow you to counter attack, and Drive Impacts which is a powerful game changer attack that can affect the flow of the opponent, either by stunning them if caught while attacking or backed into a corner, depleting their drive meter if blocked, or completely decimate them if they're on a burnout.\r\nAt the start of every round you have a full meter and have access to all of them. No need to build this meter, or save it up for the later rounds, which takes away reservations from the player and just allows them to utilize this mechanic at its fullest. Outside these Drive mechanics, most of the traditional Street Fighter 6 combat feel has been retained for the most part.\r\nGameplay has three control modes now, a beginner, more streamlined mode where special moves are done in just simple button presses; a classic, more hardcore modes where combinations are needed to perform special moves; and a more casual dynamic mode where attacks are done automatically based on the situation\r\nStreet Fighter 6's gameplay mechanics strike a delicate balance between accessibility and depth. The three control modes accommodate players of all skill levels, allowing newcomers to jump in and experience the excitement while offering seasoned veterans the opportunity for complex combos and strategies. The addition of the Drive System injects a new layer of excitement, granting characters access to powerful abilities governed by the Drive Gauge. From Overdrives to Drive Rush and Drive Impacts, these mechanics add depth and strategy to each match, offering a range of offensive and defensive options. However, the Burnout mechanic keeps players on their toes, introducing risks and consequences when the Drive Meter is depleted.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5759877) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With a masterful combination of Diablo II skill tree mechanics and dark tone, along with Diablo III's smooth combat and quality of life improvements, this latest installment in the series offers the best Diablo experience for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. I was fortunate enough to be able to play Diablo IV in Early Access, and I have to tell you guys, it is amazing. It is everything I had hoped it would be, coming from Diablo 3 and 2.\r\nDiablo IV features a dark and gothic atmosphere. The game's visuals are stunning, with meticulously designed environments that are both haunting and beautiful. From the eerie dungeons to the desolate landscapes, every location feels meticulously crafted to immerse players in a world fraught with danger and intrigue. The attention to detail and atmospheric lighting further enhance the overall experience, making exploration a visually breathtaking journey. By the time Diablo III released back in 2012, I was already unimpressed by it. This time with Diablo IV, the graphics are actually amazing.\r\nIn terms of story and tone, Diablo IV also features dark and depressing themes. It is simply classic Blizzard storytelling in play. The lore is deep and it continues the neverending conflict between demons, angels, and humans. The narrative is filled with occult and demonic elements, as well as morally ambiguous characters and deep lore that harken back to the series' roots. The storytelling is immersive, drawing players into a world on the brink of destruction and giving them a sense of purpose and urgency. Diablo IV succeeds in capturing the foreboding atmosphere and grim undertones that made Diablo II such a beloved title among fans.\r\nDiablo IV presents players with a diverse but familiar array of classes, each with its unique playstyle, abilities, and skill trees. Whether you prefer the brute force of the Barbarian, the agile skills of the Rogue, or the magic powers of the Sorceress, there's a class that caters to your preferred style of combat. The refined skill tree system — complete with a rather accessible respec system — allows for deep customization and freedom to experiment, enabling players to shape their characters' abilities and change them as they please —no need to restart a character, except if you die on the permadeath hardcore game mode.\r\nCompared to previous iterations, you can now fully customize your character's looks, its not as deep as some RPG games like Skyrim, but it is varied enough to give players a sense of identity and not look the same as everyone else.\r\nDiablo IV introduces a vast and interconnected open world with MMORPG-like features, beckoning players to venture beyond the confines of dungeons and instance based activities. It features up to four players in a party, but the outside world is instanced with many other players, resulting in an active, living world full of interaction and player characters roaming about doing their own thing.\r\nActivities are evenly spread throughout the land: hidden treasures, side quests, dungeons, strongholds and many more, ensuring that exploration is rewarded. Dynamic events further enhance the sense of immersion, as players stumble upon unexpected battles, encounters, and world-changing events. The active, living world of Diablo IV constantly surprises, making every step outside the safety of towns an adventure filled with risks and rewards.\r\nWhile the map is a seamless open world, characters will have their own instanced dungeons and sometimes even towns when the situation calls for it. The world is indeed seamless, but the game isn’t, suffering from rubber banding and constant stutters when traversing and loading from one place to another. While the rubber banding is due to the servers, the stutters are caused by VRAM usage issues that most people will experience. Even though I had an RTX 3080, I needed to turn down the texture settings from Ultra to High, to alleviate some performance stutters.\r\nThe combat in Diablo IV is a visceral and satisfying experience. The game embraces its hack-and-slash roots, offering fluid and responsive controls that make decimating hordes of enemies a joy. Each class possesses a wide range of devastating abilities and spells, allowing players to unleash their fury in spectacular fashion. The strategic use of skills, combined with the satisfying feedback from each strike and the physics system that allows you to feel your power with the bodies flying and destructible environments, creates an addictive loop of mayhem and carnage. Diablo IV truly excels in delivering a power fantasy, making players feel like godlike warriors as they obliterate demons with a mix of brute force and calculated finesse. Combat wise, the game has a much closer feel to DIablo III than II.\r\nThe gameplay in Diablo IV strikes a harmonious balance between the strategic depth of Diablo II and the fast-paced action of Diablo III. The reintroduction of the Diablo II skill tree-like system adds a layer of complexity — in some categories, you are forced to select only one choice — allowing players a sense of uniqueness and tailoring their playstyles. The feeling of progression and the satisfaction of developing unique builds reminiscent of Diablo II are a true delight. Simultaneously, Diablo III's fluid combat system ensures that battles are dynamic and exhilarating, with responsive controls and impactful abilities. The combination of these elements creates an engaging gameplay loop that keeps players hooked for hours on end.\r\nThe developers have taken note of player feedback from older games and implemented many familiar and new features that streamline the overall experience. Diablo IV addresses many of the frustrations that players encountered in the past. Something as simple as completely eliminating inventory tetris by giving items a fixed inventory space, to more complex mechanics such as skill system and itemization.\r\nThe Itemization is the best I’ve seen, especially for a game newly released. There are many different ways you can further customize your gear. Item rerolls, legendary affix customization, and many more. My only gripe so far is that while crafting resources and materials all have their own inventory “bag” to not take up space, the gems don’t, and they constantly fill half your inventory spot.\r\nAs a bonus, the game also features proper controller support adopted from its console counterparts, with seamless switching between keyboard/mouse and gamepad schemes on the fly. This is unlike the previous iteration Diablo III, which offered only mouse and keyboard support for PC while supporting gamepad controls for consoles. Diablo IV is also fully crossplay, being able to play with PS5 and Xbox players are a nice feature that essentially triples the playerbase over having a closed platform.\r\nAs said earlier, activities are evenly spread throughout the land.  There are many different ways you can play this game, ingredients to gather, legendary items or affixes to discover, challenges and rewards to aim for, and the game does a good balance of spreading many different activities that target specific in-game goals that a player would like. It results in a pretty varied gameplay experience especially since it is a game that is designed to be played for hundreds, if not thousands of hours on end after the main campaign is done. Simply put, the endgame content is deep, and doesn’t feel like an afterthought.\r\nDiablo IV is a triumphant return to the dark and enthralling world of Sanctuary, successfully blending the best aspects of Diablo II and III, to create the best iteration of Diablo yet. With its well refined gameplay mechanics, gripping storyline, and fluid combat, the game offers a satisfying and captivating experience that caters to both nostalgic fans and newcomers. It signifies Blizzard’s return to form, capturing the essence of its predecessors while introducing many new elements that make it truly a worthy addition to the Diablo franchise.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5759601) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Each card represents a specific ability or weapon that players can use during battles.\r\nThe core gameplay revolves around intense FPS fights between players – in either 1v1 or 2v2 format, where they utilize their chosen character's unique skill and strategically deploy cards from their deck. As a player, you'll have to make tactical decisions on which cards to use at specific moments, considering their strengths, weaknesses, and synergies. At the end of the day though, it ultimately boils down to the FPS action as shooting them down is ultimately the most reliable way of killing them.\r\nThe FPS experience of Friends vs Friends is fluid for the most part. Gunshots have impact, movement is fluid, and you have numerical feedback on hits in an RPG fashion. Without the card power-ups and buffs, the closest experience to the gunplay I can think of is probably a source engine game like Half-Life 2 or CS:GO, although I found that the maps are too small and cramped for my tastes to cater to the frantic and chaotic gameplay this game is offering.\r\nThere are many different cards you could choose from that affect the gameplay. Slow-motion cards, powerful weapons, cards that will make your head smaller, or make the enemies’ bigger, debuff cards, disappearing cards, reversal cards, or even as straightforward as increasing speed, or replenishing HP. And you can collect more and level these cards by just playing the game.\r\nFriends vs Friends isn’t as popular as many other multiplayer shooter games right now, so I found the matchmaking a little longer than usual. Fortunately we have an instant rematch option if every player is willing, for those looking for a quick match without re-queueing. As for the matchmaking, the game can get a bit imbalanced if you’re matched with other players who have a pretty beefed up deck of cards equipped. Player skill still triumphs in this game, but I wish there was a way to make the playing field a bit more balanced.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5772069) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "DOOMBLADE\r\nDoomblade is a 2D platforming metroidvania with unique combat and platforming mechanics, developed by Muro Studios and published by Iceberg Interactive for PC.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Feels overall refreshing and completely a brand new experience\r\n- Innovative control schemes\r\n- Amazing art direction## Cons\r\n-The difficulty of using the mouse or right stick for aiming is not for everyone\r\n-Confusing level design\r\nDoomblade, offers a highly unique take on the Metroidvania genre. With its innovative combat mechanics featuring precision-based clicking much like mouse rhythm games like Osu!, or twin stick shooter style of combat when using controllers.\r\nDoomblade features a weird but actually refreshing mix of lightheartedness and creepy demonic undertones. The art direction is simply amazing and refreshing. The cartoonish, stylized graphics are a weird match for demonic themed, flora based landscapes with sci-fi and industrial technologies sprinkled in for good measure, but it actually works and is a refreshing sight to see. Accompanying the visuals is a captivating soundtrack that complements the fractured environment. From metal rock to orchestral tunes, the music captures the essence of each area and encounter, enhancing immersion and setting the mood for exploration and intense battles.\r\nThe story follows Gloom Girl, stumbling upon the titular Doomblade, an awakened weapon filled with an insatiable desire to break free from its long-standing chains. United as a formidable duo “Gloom and Doom”, they embark on a vengeful journey to unleash their formidable abilities and eradicate the Dread Lords forever.\r\nDoomblade's gameplay revolves around its precision-based combat highly intertwined with its platforming system, which sets it apart from traditional Metroidvania games. The combat mechanics require players to click enemies or use the right stick for aiming to launch towards it for an attack.

The game's boss fights are more of the same, but require even more reflexes and precision, although some require players to decipher riddles or indulge in good old-fashioned button mashing. The variety in boss designs and attack patterns keeps players on their toes, ensuring each encounter feels unique and rewarding.\r\nHowever, the game's combat system, heavily reliant on mouse input or right stick, may pose challenges for players unaccustomed to precision based clicking or aiming. For the controller, the pinpoint precision necessary to select targets in a group may be compromised as well. Nevertheless, for players who can adapt to the gameplay style, Doomblade provides a satisfying experience of rhythmic mouse swiping, button clicking, and sword clashing that makes each battle a thrilling experience.\r\nDoomblade offers a 2D semi-open world of sorts that encourages exploration and freedom to roam around, although some areas are outright unreachable unless you acquire the necessary skills to be able to reach these areas, such as a mid-air dash, for example. The game uses a save-checkpoint system that reverts your progress back to the last saved location after death.\r\nHowever, with the game’s freedom comes the caveats: the game occasionally falls short in providing clear guidance on the correct path, leading to moments of confusion and potentially sending players into unnecessary dead ends and back-and-forthing.\r\nWhile maintaining the core elements that make this genre so beloved, it puts its own unique spin on it that feels overall refreshing and completely a brand new experience. In fact, with enough following, it may even spawn a sub genre on its own down the line.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5771393) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Harry Potter: Magic AwakenedUS\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nHarry Potter: Magic Awakened is a free-to-play third-person and deck-building game for mobile devices. It features a live-service game format and stylized graphics that magically recreates the wonderful Wizarding World of Harry Potter.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Immersive Hogwarts experience\r\n- Compelling storyline set shortly after the events of the series\r\n- Deck-building combat system with a unique twist\r\n- Familiar spells and creatures for Harry Potter fans## Cons\r\n-Immersion-breaking character inclusions for some of the companion cards\r\nThe story follows shortly after the end of the Harry Potter series, with the player taking on the role of a newly accepted student. Giving us a rare look at the aftermath of the series, with occasional flashbacks that transport us back to memorable events, allowing us to relive those moments as they are told by various characters.\r\nThe story is impressive for a mobile game, featuring fully animated and voice-acted cutscenes instead of the usual visual-novel style approach. Nevertheless, you still have the option to fast forward or skip these cutscenes if you prefer to focus solely on the deck-building and combat gameplay.\r\nHarry Potter: Magic Awakened re-introduces us to the world of wizarding once again, following a similar path to the one Harry Potter took, with Hagrid guiding us and leading us through Diagon Alley for school supplies. It allows us to customize our appearance and attire, introduces us to the deck-based combat system, and lets us choose owls as companions, among many other features.\r\nThe characters featured in the game embody the traditional Harry Potter tropes that we are already familiar with: grumpy, intelligent, comic relief, quirky, and eccentric. However, some of them are presented as mashed up variations of the original Harry Potter characters. For example, there is a nerdy version of Ron Weasley, a forgetful Hermione, a female Draco Malfoy, and even twins with now a grumpy attitude.\r\nThe initial gameplay format offers a third-person exploration experience, faithfully recreating the wizarding world in an artistic and stylized format. While the visuals may not be as realistic or awe-inspiring as the AAA title Hogwarts Legacy, they still capture the essence and feeling of the Harry Potter universe.\r\nPlayers can freely roam around a simplified version of Hogwarts, explore the castle premises, visit their dormitory, and even enjoy the thrill of riding broomsticks and flying around Hogwarts. However, for those solely interested in the deck-building aspect, there is an option to fast travel and completely skip the third-person free roam gameplay.\r\nThe game presents a main story that takes players on an adventure similar to a proper narrative-driven game, offering a compelling experience that almost mirrors the original series in terms of premise where a group of new students embark on an adventure in Hogwarts. In terms of overall presentation, it could actually give Hogwarts: Legacy a run for its money.\r\nWhile the game features third-person gameplay, the main combat element revolves around a deck-based combat system utilizing cards called Charms. This system differs from traditional approaches as it incorporates movement cards, allowing players to navigate the 3D battle arena. It isn't purely turn-based or tactical in nature.\r\nAt the start of battle, a random deck of cards is drawn, and additional cards are drawn as the battle progresses. Players can use these cards by dragging them from the deck and applying them to the arena. They can be used on the ground for area-of-effect effects or directly on enemies. The resulting battles are visually satisfying and tactically engaging, providing a well rounded experience.\r\nThe cards range from magical spells Harry Potter fans would find familiar, to summoning creatures like spiders or trolls. You can even have companion “cards” that can call for characters to aid you — including characters from the series like the Malfoy gang. While this inclusion may be slightly immersion-breaking, it is a deliberate aspect of the game, likely intended to make the card collecting feature more appealing to Harry Potter fans.\r\nAs a live service game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, cosmetics, and premium currency. There is also a gacha system in the game that features a very transparent drop rate, which can be seen before opening.\r\nThese live service features are all seamlessly integrated to the Hogwarts experience and feels just like part of it. For instance, the daily login bonuses are designed to make players feel like they are attending Hogwarts on a daily basis, adding to the immersion.\r\nThe PvP game mode on the other hand is presented as a dueling club, allowing players to engage in competitive battles with other players .There are many other features as well; such as a guild system called clubs, the ability to set your friends as actual dormmates, and even invite them into your game world.\r\nThese features contribute to the game's immersive engagement and provide players with a sense that you exist within the magical world of Hogwarts and not just another mobile game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5772879) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players assume the role of Forrest Nash, a late night radio talk show host on 189.16, “The Scream”, in the small town of Gallows Creek. The game revolves around the mysterious return of the killer known as The Whistling Man, who is causing havoc in the town.\r\nThe game takes us to Forrest Nash’s radio station late at night, where you are also tasked with operating the DJ Booth’s controls to play music, operate the phone lines, and perform DJ duties. Forrest Nash starts a new program called “Guess that Scream”, inviting callers to guess a random scream played on the show. However, the situation becomes serious when genuine calls are received from scared characters seeking help, and players must use everything at their disposal, including solving various puzzles, to assist them. The time-sensitive aspect adds tension and a sense of urgency to the gameplay.\r\nThese puzzles range from starting cars to guiding characters out of mazes, providing challenges and time-sensitive situations. The majority of the gameplay revolves around making the correct dialogue choices, with some of them being timed. The correct dialogue choices can determine the fate of the callers, providing a compelling narrative aspect to the game. It's both satisfying and nerve-wracking to navigate through these choices, as they directly impact the survival of the residents. The puzzles overall are logical and straightforward, and nothing out of the ordinary is given to the player.\r\nOverall, I can say that Killer Frequency is a unique game that blends storytelling, interactiveness, and playfulness to create a distinct and captivating experience that sets it apart from other titles in the genre.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5779405) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Amnesia: The Bunker Amnesia: The Bunker, developed by the creators of the popular horror games SOMA, Penumbra, and the Amnesia series, is a first-person horror game that takes players on a gripping journey through the dark and claustrophobic corridors of a World War I bunker.",

    "category": "review",
    "body": "## Pros\r\n- Intense scary atmosphere\r\n- Non-linear semi-open world\r\n- Dynamic puzzles with multiple solutions makes it highly replayable\r\n- Frantic resource management mechanics\r\n- AI-driven monster that can appear almost anytime, anywhere## Cons\r\n-Can lose a lot of progression upon dying, especially at higher levels\r\nGraphically, the game is visually stunning and detailed, which is mighty impressive for an Indie Studio. It genuinely portrays the bleakness and decay of the bunker. The dimly lit environments, flickering lights, and atmospheric effects create a chilling aesthetic that draws players deeper into the immersive horror experience. The visual and audio elements work in perfect harmony to create an unsettling and haunting atmosphere throughout the game.\r\nThere are three difficulty levels to select at the start, and each one will make The Beast increasingly harder to avoid, and the player easier to die. There is also an optional ‘Hints’ option that greatly assists the player in navigating the bunker. However, they serve as both a godsend, providing much-needed respite in tense moments, and a detriment to the overall dynamic horror experience by spoon feeding the player solutions.\r\nThe game's atmosphere engulfs you in a suffocating sense of dread and isolation. The bunker may be small compared to other games with humongous open world levels, but the developers have masterfully crafted the environment and opted for quality over quantity, paying attention to every detail to create a truly immersive and foreboding setting. The dimly lit corridors, the flickering lights, the peeling paint on the walls, and the haunting echoes of silence all contribute to a palpable sense of unease. Making it set in a World War I era adds an extra layer of authenticity to the experience, making the bunker feel hauntingly real.\r\nThe exploration is further enhanced by the multiple solutions to puzzles and locks. Players are faced with various obstacles, and they can choose to approach them in different ways. Whether it's finding a key item to unlock a door, solving puzzles, or making strategic choices to evade the relentless monster, the game gives players freedom in determining their own path through the bunker. This non-linear approach adds replayability, as different playthroughs can offer unique experiences based on the choices made.\r\nFor instance, when encountering a puzzle, you can opt to take your time and search for a key item, avoiding brute force that could generate unnecessary noise. However, this approach carries the risk of depleting your fuel reserves, ultimately leading to the entire bunker running out of electricity. Similarly, you have the choice to rewind your flashlight to enhance visibility in the darkness. But be cautious, as this action may produce noise, potentially attracting the relentless beast that pursues you.\r\nSometimes, when faced with a locked door, you can decide whether to employ a brick to break the lock or use your gun to shoot it open. While both methods are bruce-force noisy, the latter method has the higher risk of attracting the monster with the sound of gunfire but leaves you with one less bullet for future encounters. The puzzle items and combinations are also randomized every playthrough, ensuring that the game is unpredictable, replayable, and hard to master.\r\nIn contrast to enemies found in previous Amnesia series titles, The Beast in Amnesia: The Bunker demonstrates dynamic and adaptive behavior. It can appear in almost every location and at unpredictable times throughout the map — cleverly utilizing the holes at the walls, reacting to the protagonist's actions. This dynamic nature of the monster adds an element of danger and heightened challenge to the gameplay experience. While this tension is amazingly done, the progression can sometimes suffer from huge setbacks, especially when playing in higher difficulty levels and dying constantly, to the point that redoing large segments of the game becomes a little more annoying and a little less scary.\r\nAs a key part of the protagonist's survival, Amnesia: The Bunker also introduces resource management mechanics that heighten the sense of tension and desperation – effectively replacing the “Sanity” mechanic found in older titles. The bunker's electricity relies on a generator that operates on fuel, which is randomly scattered throughout the bunker with each playthrough.\r\nPlayers must diligently scavenge every corner, searching for fuel containers to maintain electrical illumination—an aspect that repels The Beast and lets the player move more easily, and honestly — makes the game a lot less scary. This resource becomes a valuable commodity, as it directly influences the visibility and safety of the environment. Still, you can still choose to operate in the dark, maybe to conserve your fuel, or you just like a good challenge for some reason.\r\nIt's not only fuel cans or puzzle items that need to be scavenged but also ammunition — because now, the players have finally been given a weapon*. This marks a significant departure from previous games in the series, which emphasized the lack of weapons as a key element of their fear factor. Surprisingly, Amnesia: The Bunker manages to circumvent this sacred rule while still preserving its original atmosphere and essence. Unfortunately for the player, ammo is severely limited and deliberately designed to have a slow and tedious reloading process. This deliberate design choice heightens the genuine tension experienced in the game. You can use these ammunition to repel the monster, or as a brute force solution in some of the puzzles.\r\nThe combination of the monster's AI, the limited resources available, and the randomized puzzle design creates a constant tension that keeps players on edge even with repeat playthroughs. It is crucial to remain vigilant, choose your actions wisely, and adapt your playstyle to evade or confront the monster when necessary. The AI's reactive nature adds an element of unpredictability, ensuring that no two encounters feel the same and keeping players in a state of constant unease. The game is quite short, and as mentioned earlier, the bunker is not really a big level to delve into. You can easily beat this game in under four hours, maybe even less if playing on the lowest difficulty and having mastered the map layout.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5785281) Originally posted on TapTap.",

From the colorful landscapes to the quirky characters, every aspect of the game is even more visually captivating than before.\r\nBut it's not just about the visuals. We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie also comes with gameplay refinements that make it even more enjoyable. The controls have been fine-tuned, offering controller as well as keyboard support for alternative rolling as you gather objects and build your katamari.\r\nWe Love Katamari REROLL+ is an absolute piece of insanity and absurdity. From the moment you start rolling that sticky ball, you're catapulted into a world where logic takes a backseat and chaos literally reigns supreme. The game throws you into a whirlwind of bizarre scenarios, outrageous characters, and mind-bending environments that defy any sense of normalcy.\r\nIt takes players on the adventures of the Prince and his colorful and eccentric family, known as the King of All Cosmos and the Queen. The story begins with the King of All Cosmos accidentally destroying all the stars in the sky while on a stargazing trip. In order to rectify this cosmic disaster, the King enlists the help of his tiny son, the Prince, to roll up objects on Earth and recreate the stars. Despite the simplicity of the story, We Love Katamari's charm lies in its absurdity and whimsical nature, as well as its pretty mesmerizing gameplay.\r\nIn We Love Katamari REROLL+, the simple act of rolling a sticky ball, called a Katamari, takes center stage, creating a strangely addictive and mesmerizing gameplay loop. With its charming visuals, catchy and as equally as weird soundtrack, and an array of creative levels, We Love Katamari is a true gem in the world of video games that finally had its well deserved remaster.\r\nAt its core, We Love Katamari REROLL+ is all about rolling that sticky ball around various environments and collecting as many objects as possible to make the ball grow bigger. The larger the Katamari becomes, the more massive and diverse objects it can pick up.\r\nStarting from humble beginnings, players are tasked with rolling up small objects, trash objects or room clutter, gradually progressing to collect larger items such as cats, bicycles, and even buildings. The mechanics are simple and easy to grasp, making it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.\r\nThe controls overall are kind of hard to grasp at first, especially that you need to use both sticks or dual four directional buttons (WASD and IJKL) to roll the Katamari around, but after a while, it gets intuitive and just becomes second nature. The HD in-game UI — now with proper 16:9 support — adds to the overall ease of play, making it accessible for both newcomers and fans of the original game. However, you still cannot control your camera properly and are at the mercy of the game's auto camera function when rolling the Katamari around.\r\nThe physics-based movement of the ball feels satisfying and realistic, yet absurdly entertaining, albeit sometimes frustrating, as it sticks to various objects and rolls with unpredictable momentum. The game also introduced new gameplay mechanics compared to the first game, including the ability to perform special moves such as jumps and spins, adding depth and variety to the rolling experience.\r\nWe Love Katamari REROLL+ features a wide range of imaginative and whimsical levels. From a bustling cityscape to a tranquil countryside, each level is filled with unique challenges and surprises.

    "body": "The game's atmosphere engulfs you in a suffocating sense of dread and isolation. The bunker may be small compared to other games with humongous open world levels, but the developers have masterfully crafted the environment and opted for quality over quantity, paying attention to every detail to create a truly immersive and foreboding setting.\r\nThe exploration is further enhanced by the multiple solutions to puzzles and locks. Players are faced with various obstacles, and they can choose to approach them in different ways. Whether it's finding a key item to unlock a door, solving puzzles, or making strategic choices to evade the relentless monster, the game gives players freedom in determining their own path through the bunker. This non-linear approach adds replayability, as different playthroughs can offer unique experiences based on the choices made.\r\nIn contrast to enemies found in previous Amnesia series titles, The Beast in Amnesia: The Bunker demonstrates dynamic and adaptive behavior. It can appear in almost every location and at unpredictable times throughout the map — cleverly utilizing the holes at the walls, reacting to the protagonist's actions.\r\nAs a key part of the protagonist's survival, Amnesia: The Bunker also introduces resource management mechanics that heighten the sense of tension and desperation – effectively replacing the “Sanity” mechanic found in older titles. The bunker's electricity relies on a generator that operates on fuel, which is randomly scattered throughout the bunker with each playthrough.\r\nIt's not only fuel cans or puzzle items that need to be scavenged but also ammunition — because now, the players have finally been given a weapon*. This marks a significant departure from previous games in the series, which emphasized the lack of weapons as a key element of their fear factor. Surprisingly, Amnesia: The Bunker manages to circumvent this sacred rule while still preserving its original atmosphere and essence.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5785213) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The character designs are superb, charming, and showcase high attention to detail. Vibrant environments, ranging from grasslands to forests and deserts, create an immersive world for players to explore and battle in. The animations are super fluid and it's one of the most visually impressive mobile gacha games I’ve played in recent times.\r\nThe Japanese voice acting adds personality and emotion to the characters, enhancing the overall experience. The inclusion of various text localizations, including English and Chinese, ensures accessibility for players worldwide. The localizations may be a bit rough around the edges, but they are still passable and understandable.\r\nKemono Friends: Kingdom introduces us to the player named main character, a human who awakens in Kingdom, a park separate from the famous Japari Park of the animated series.

Acquiring new Friends through gacha pulls and events keeps the experience fresh. Leveling up Friends, equipping them with gear, and unlocking their potential provide a solid sense of progression and accomplishment.\r\nEach Friend also possesses distinct characteristics, abilities, and Radiance types: Brilliance, Wonder, and Splendor. Understanding the rock-paper-scissors relationships between these Radiances adds depth to team-building, as certain types restrain others, granting advantages in battles.\r\nFriends are categorized into different positions called “Nature”, each with specific roles or miracles. Guard Friends strengthen defense and generate shields, Assault Friends deal high damage, Support Friends enhance team output, Control Friends reduce enemy attacks, and Healer Friends restore health. Building a well-rounded team by incorporating Friends from various positions is essential for success.\r\nA Friends party is composed of a maximum of seven members and one assist Friend, and the player can participate in a lot of varied activities such as endless challenges, missions to target specific materials, or just outright “blitz” any level you’ve completed with a 3 star rating, allowing for a quick progression, if you have plenty of energy; and yes there is an energy system in place, so players may reach this limit when playing and have to spend money or wait to be able to play again. Most of these game modes are unlockable in the early parts of the game, offering early accessibility for players.\r\nKemono Friends: Kingdom incorporates kingdom-building elements as well, allowing players to construct buildings and develop the Kingdom Park. The game features a prerequisite system where certain buildings require other buildings or specific chapters completed to be constructed. Each building offers unique bonuses to the player like a passive income of energy or credits.\r\nThe story campaign is filled with voice-acted visual novel dialogues, but players can choose to skip them and read a summarized version of the cutscenes instead, which is a neat feature that can keep players still updated on the narrative even if they opt to skip it.\r\nAs usual with these types of gacha RPG games, the strategic aspects of the turn-based battles add depth to the gameplay. Players must pay attention to the enemies, consider their Friends' strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities to form effective teams.

From the colorful landscapes to the quirky characters, every aspect of the game is even more visually captivating than before.\r\nWe Love Katamari REROLL+ is an absolute piece of insanity and absurdity. From the moment you start rolling that sticky ball, you're catapulted into a world where logic takes a backseat and chaos literally reigns supreme. The game throws you into a whirlwind of bizarre scenarios, outrageous characters, and mind-bending environments that defy any sense of normalcy.\r\nIn We Love Katamari REROLL+, the simple act of rolling a sticky ball, called a Katamari, takes center stage, creating a strangely addictive and mesmerizing gameplay loop. With its charming visuals, catchy and as equally as weird soundtrack, and an array of creative levels, We Love Katamari is a true gem in the world of video games that finally had its well deserved remaster.\r\nStarting from humble beginnings, players are tasked with rolling up small objects, trash objects or room clutter, gradually progressing to collect larger items such as cats, bicycles, and even buildings. The mechanics are simple and easy to grasp, making it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.\r\nWe Love Katamari REROLL+ features a wide range of imaginative and whimsical levels. From a bustling cityscape to a tranquil countryside, each level is filled with unique challenges and surprises.

In this game, players take on the role of the protagonist, Shovel Knight, who becomes trapped within a magical artifact called the Pocket Dungeon.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique gameplay blend of puzzles and dungeon crawling\r\n- Challenging and Strategic puzzles\r\n- Highly customizable game parameters\r\n- Additional game modes like 1v1 and daily/weekly runs## Cons\r\n-High difficulty for the default game parameters\r\n-Storytelling takes a backseat\r\nShovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is an engaging and addictive roguelike dungeon crawler puzzle available on Switch, PC, and with a Netflix exclusive port for Android and iOS. It draws inspiration from retro-style 2D platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. With its pixelated art style and charming graphics, the game pays homage to classic video games.\r\nShovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is an homage to the retro 2D platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras, taking inspiration from classic games. Its graphics strive to recreate the pixelated art style and nostalgic appeal of those early video games. By utilizing a restricted color palette and implementing precise pixel animations, Shovel Knight captures the aesthetic reminiscent of the NES and SNES era. The game showcases vibrant and colorful pixel art, with character and enemy designs that have slightly more detail compared to the original game.\r\nIn the game's storyline, players assume the role of Shovel Knight, the main character who finds himself trapped inside a mystical artifact known as the Pocket Dungeon. In order to escape, Shovel Knight must engage in battles against fellow knights who have also suffered a similar fate, fighting his way out of the perilous situation. The story isn’t the strongest point of the game, and merely saves as the premise to set up the puzzle-centric gameplay of this spin-off.\r\nThe core gameplay of Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon combines elements of three-match puzzle mechanics and Tetris style falling blocks, with dungeon crawling, resulting in a unique puzzle RPG experience. Players take control of Shovel Knight or nine other playable characters with their own abilities, navigating them on an 8x8 grid where they can move up, down, left or right. As enemies and blocks descend from above and fill the grid, players must strategically move and attack to clear them. Failure to defeat an enemy results in the player receiving damage equivalent to the enemy's offensive strength. Movement by one unit instantly drops the blocks downward, while choosing not to move causes the blocks to descend slowly.\r\nGroups of enemies can be cleared simultaneously, a mechanic called \"chaining,\" when they are connected with each other, resembling match-three puzzle clearing elements like Candy Crush. These enemies come in various shapes and sizes, with some being straightforward and having fixed health and damage values, while others pose more challenging encounters. Certain enemies deploy shields in the direction of the initial attack, necessitating attacks from different angles, while some enemies require precise timing to avoid devastating counter-attacks.\r\nIn addition to enemies and blocks, various elements such as keys and bombs fall from above. Keys are essential for opening chests and doorways, while bombs clear a significant portion of the surrounding area. The game also incorporates helpful items that enhance Shovel Knight's abilities, such as a spear that extends his attack range or a weapon that freezes enemies in place. These items can be obtained through in-game shops using gems earned during runs. The shops offer both persistent upgrades in the camp shop and temporary boosts in the in-run shops.\r\nAs a roguelike game, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon features two main ways to handle defeat. The default options are permadeath, where dying results in an instant fail, and a more forgiving option that allows players to respawn, and the game only ends when the grid becomes completely filled with blocks.\r\nShovel Knight Pocket Dungeon offers a challenging gameplay experience, which can be attributed to the limited base HP (health points) and attack power of your character. This means that you will have to carefully strategize and make the most of your resources in order to overcome the obstacles and enemies you encounter in the game. However, the game developers have taken player preferences into consideration by providing a highly customizable feature.\r\nThis allows you to adjust the game parameters according to your liking, providing a more lenient experience if you find the default difficulty too demanding. You can modify various aspects such as character attributes, enemy behavior, and overall pacing of the game to create a gameplay experience that suits your skill level and desired level of challenge.\r\nBeyond the main adventure mode, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon provides a range of additional game modes that add to its replay value. Players can engage in 1v1 battles against either real players (using two sides of the same screen) or CPU opponents, offering opportunities for competitive gameplay. The inclusion of weekly and daily runs, accompanied by preexisting dungeon modifiers and rewards when target goals are achieved, further extends the game's longevity and encourages players to return regularly for new challenges.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5799624) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Bleak Sword DX\r\nBleak Sword DX is a pixel art soulslike-roguelite that offers an enhanced version of the original game for PC and Switch, following its initial exclusive release on Apple Arcade.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Striking visual style, combining 1-bit aesthetics with modern visuals\r\n- Challenging and satisfying souls-like combat\r\n- Quick and accessible gameplay; short levels and forgiving restarts\r\n- New game modes, controller support, and additional DLC chapters## Cons\r\n-Gets repetitive after a while\r\n-RPG mechanics not as deep\r\n-Limited narrative depth\r\nIn Bleak Sword DX, the protagonist is not the one wielding the titular Bleak Sword; rather, they must seek to destroy the weapon itself. As an unnamed warrior, your task is to lift the curse of the legendary Bleak Sword that has plagued the land for over two hundred years. While the story is not that deep, it serves as a premise and backdrop for the hack-and-slash combat action.\r\nAs an enhanced PC/Switch version of the Apple Arcade exclusive, Bleak Sword DX introduces several new features that enhance the gameplay and expand the overall experience, mainly adding three new game modes: A randomized campaign run, a boss run only mode, and an arena wave survival mode. Bleak Sword DX also includes all the original chapters from the base game, as well as three additional DLC chapters.\r\nThe game's visuals combine a 1-bit aesthetic with modern visual effects, along with a filter that adds a nostalgic touch of old box TVs with distortion effects. The soundtrack complements the black and white ominous atmosphere perfectly, while the sound effects effectively highlight impactful hits, parries, and sword swings.\r\nThe gameplay in Bleak Sword DX is straightforward, with levels each comprising singular blocks and grouped into 12 chapters. Players must clear each level of monsters and survive waves of enemies. The levels are relatively short, ranging from a few seconds in the early stages to a few minutes in the more challenging ones.\r\nWhat sets this game apart from most roguelikes is that you don't have to start from scratch if you die. Instead, you can immediately jump back into the level without feeling frustrated or having lost significant progress. The only roguelite element is that if you die, you are given one last chance to repeat that level; otherwise, you lose any items and XP acquired thus far. Each chapter concludes with a boss encounter that presents a fair challenge, even on the first attempt, without feeling unbalanced or overly frustrating.\r\nCombat in Bleak Sword DX revolves around kinetic gameplay mechanics and features systems such as dodging, blocking, and parrying, along with a stamina system that is consumed with attacks (but not dodges, making them slightly overpowered). The controls are responsive, and the parrying system is forgiving, striking a satisfying balance. Despite the dodge and parry mechanics feeling a bit overpowered, the enemies' diverse characteristics and attack patterns prevent the combat from becoming monotonous. Some enemies strike quickly, while others require multiple hits to defeat or execute powerful attack combos.\r\nAside from combat, the player also earns XP over time and levels up, resulting in increased stats. They are given the choice to increase health, defense, or attack. Additionally, the player discovers and collects equipable items and consumables to enhance their journey. However, the overall system feels simplistic and lacks depth, as it doesn't provide ample avenues for customization.\r\nThe game disappointingly limits players to only two item slots, restricting their ability to fully personalize their playstyle compared to full body itemization in other RPG games. Nonetheless, the progression system adds a sense of growth and development to the otherwise repetitive gameplay. The gradual increase in power is noticeable, as for example, enemies that initially required 4 hits to defeat now succumb to just 2 hits. The player also gains noticeable improved durability, allowing them to withstand more damage than before.\r\nWhile the gameplay loop may become repetitive over time, the challenging hack-and-slash nature of Bleak Sword DX keeps players on their toes and engaged. The core concept revolves around clearing one level and moving on to the next, employing a combination of dodging, parrying, and slashing. There is a slight change in how the game plays in one particular level where players ride a horse, navigating obstacles and eliminating enemies along the way, but otherwise it is a pretty consistent experience from start to end.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5802066) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It is currently conducting an Alpha test from June 13, 2023, to June 20, 2023 and players are free to test out this title. Since this is an Alpha test, expect this to be in a very early state, and not even close to playable and enjoyable.\r\nMetria features cel-shaded, anime inspired graphics and a storyline that is actually gripping and worth tuning in for, based on my first impressions. It doesn’t look as visually impressive as other high-end similar games, lacking in many things such as motion blur, fluid effects, and an expansive open-world to explore. The graphics are already decent enough for its current early state, but it’s not without its current visual issues which are to be expected.\r\nThe game plays as a third person hack-and-slash, with seamless character switching consisting of a party of three. Since this was a test phase, I was already able to try out other characters even though they had not appeared yet in the story. It features your traditional character tropes usually seen in these kinds of games, each with their own set of skills and playstyles: swordsman, spearman, mages, archers, etc.\r\nThe combat feels a bit stiff, with unresponsive controls and animations that aren't fluid and don't mesh well with each other. However, it has all the flashy and over-the-top moves and skills, which are expected from a hack-and-slash RPG game. This is probably a temporary limitation, but for some reason, in some areas, you can control the camera horizontally only, no looking up or down.\r\nThe world is set to feature a huge map that is separated into instances of open areas where monsters of varying levels populate the landscape. This means that every time you switch areas, you are presented with a loading screen. They are pretty quick, but long enough to be annoying after going through a handful of times and realizing you have to continuously go through them — especially when partaking in missions and quests.\r\nOverall, this game shows a lot of promise with its gripping story coupled with its hack-and-slash gameplay, but I don’t like loading screens and how stiff the combat is currently. Judging from my first impressions, it seems that Metria is probably a few solid years away from completion.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5814353) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "RPG METRIA the Starlight\r\n7.6\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nRPG\r\nDownload\r\nMetria is an action RPG currently in development for mobile devices. It is currently conducting an Alpha test from June 13, 2023, to June 20, 2023, and players are free to test out this title. Since this is an Alpha test, expect it to be in a very early state, far from being playable and enjoyable.\r\n## Pros\r\n- The story is interesting\r\n- The world is vibrant and colorful\r\n- Third person combat shows a lot of promise## Cons\r\n-Lots of loading screens\r\n-Stiff combat\r\n-Performances issues\r\nMetria features cel-shaded, anime inspired graphics and a storyline that is actually gripping and worth tuning in for, based on my first impressions. It doesn’t look as visually impressive as other high-end similar games, lacking in many things such as motion blur, fluid effects, and an expansive open-world to explore. The graphics are already decent enough for its current early state, but it’s not without its current visual issues which are to be expected.\r\nWhile the game's art style is vibrant and colorful, in my experience the overall experience felt dull and flat. Currently, there is no voice acting, although the game seems like it will have it based on how the dialogues are presented in the cutscenes. There is no background music implemented for these character dialogues for now, so that means character cutscenes are completely dead silent. The exploration and combat phases however, already feature a fitting orchestral background sound.\r\nThe story immediately intrigued me from the start, plunging our main characters, Rio, Lucas, and the princess, in the middle of an escape from a burning castle. It then quickly cuts to Rio in a faraway remote region, devoid of any memories of what transpired. As soon as these questions are answered, other more intriguing ones arise, making the storyline gripping compared to its contemporaries.\r\nThe game plays as a third person hack-and-slash, with seamless character switching consisting of a party of three. Since this was a test phase, I was already able to try out other characters even though they had not appeared yet in the story. It features your traditional character tropes usually seen in these kinds of games, each with their own set of skills and playstyles: swordsman, spearman, mages, archers, etc.\r\nThe combat feels a bit stiff, with unresponsive controls and animations that aren't fluid and don't mesh well with each other.

This means that every time you switch areas, you are presented with a loading screen. They are pretty quick, but long enough to be annoying after going through a handful of times and realizing you have to continuously go through them — especially when partaking in missions and quests.\r\nYou can also undertake mundane tasks taken from survival games like picking up flora, chopping down trees, and even going on fishing, although they are pretty basic as far as functionality goes, and likely there as placeholder stuff to do for now. You can teleport back to your base, which is a nice looking city filled with NPC with shops and services like crafting, and extra content like the Level of Trials: a repeatable dungeon crawling element with daily rewards.\r\nOther elements that are currently under development are gacha mechanics, which means your characters (and their quality) will predominantly come from these gacha pulls; online features, which will probably mean clans or playing with friends; and character leveling and upgrading systems using materials.\r\nAs for the technical analysis, it is currently very laggy, having below expected frame rates considering I am running on a Snapdragon 888 device and the game doesn’t look close to visually stunning games like Genshin Impact or Aether Gazer. There are also graphical issues present like a random artifacts appearing on screen, or the sky turning black. The UI is also a bit ugly early 2000s and barebones looking.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5814364) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective\r\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective, the beloved Nintendo DS puzzle-adventure game from Capcom, has returned in a remarkable remastered edition for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC platforms.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Beautiful art style made even better looking\r\n- Unique puzzle-adventure gameplay\r\n- Time sensitive and time manipulation mechanics\r\n- Compelling narrative with detective themes\r\n- Bonus optional soundtrack## Cons\r\n-Prolonged dialogue sequences before gameplay segments\r\n-Not full 16:9 aspect ratio — has thick borders on the sides\r\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective has been revitalized with completely HD graphics and flawless animations, breathing new life into its charming world. The game is set to be released on June 30, 2023, but there is a demo on Steam already available for players to try. I was able to play the demo version that allows players to experience the story up to Chapter 2. Notably, any saved data from the demo can be seamlessly transferred to the full version of the game once players purchase it.\r\nThe transition to HD graphics in Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is nothing short of breathtaking. Every scene, character, and object is rendered with high level to detail coming from the almost pixelated graphics of the Nintendo DS version, boasting stunning visual fidelity that showcases the game's unique Art Deco cartoonish art style in all its glory. The beautifully designed characters are now fluidly animated instead of being in retro-ish low frame rate, while the environments exude a level of detail that was previously unappreciated.  That being said, the game is still not in full 16:9 screen aspect ratio, rather, it has thick borders on the sides that are used as a UI element for the gameplay.\r\nThe enhanced animations in the remastered version further elevate the gameplay experience. Every movement and action is rendered in a very surreal fashion, enhancing the immersion and making the world feel more alive than ever before.\r\nThe remastered version also introduces new optional music arrangements ranging from melancholic piano pieces to thrilling orchestral scores, by the renowned composer Yasumasa Kitagawa, the celebrated composer known for his work on the Great Ace Attorney series. Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective not only enhances the gameplay and audio experience but also introduces a gallery of artwork and music.\r\nAt its core, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective maintains the same unforgettable gameplay and compelling narrative that made the original game a unique and memorable title. As Sissel, a recently deceased man with a ridiculously tall yellow cone shape of a hair — now a ghost — with the ability to possess objects and manipulate the physical world. With these powers called “ghost tricks”, players must unravel the mysteries surrounding their own death and save other characters from their impending demise. The intricate environmental and situation puzzles, which require creative thinking and manipulation of the environment to affect its surroundings and change the fate of anyone nearby, remain as engaging and challenging as ever with its time sensitive manner.\r\nThe gameplay revolves around Sissel's attempt to possess objects individually, desperately reaching from one object to another due to the limited range of his powers. Aside from pausing time to possess an object, Sissel also has the ability to travel back in time to the final four minutes before someone’s death, in an effort to save their life. This time-travel ability allows him to continuously attempt different approaches while seeking additional clues to advance in the game. These puzzles are designed with a time limit, creating a sense of urgency and challenge for players. However, the forgiving nature of the game allows players to retry and make multiple attempts until they find the solution.\r\nThe game's narrative is filled with an intriguing detective-esque story and a sharp, witty, and funny dialogue that has aged relatively well even more than a decade later. These dialogues aren’t fully voiced, which would have been a great icing on the cake for this remaster, so prepare for a bit of heavy reading -– especially that the game is heavily story driven. The game frequently has prolonged dialogue sequences, which can sometimes hamper the player's excitement to engage in some puzzle solving, ghost trick action. Other than that, the game is at its best when you’re trying to solve puzzles.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5815304) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The story chapter sequences are faithfully recreated, scene by scene, ensuring a familiar experience for fans. The intro successfully captures the same vibes as the anime, featuring the identical intro music and voices. It feels as though the exact dialogue from the anime has been seamlessly integrated into the game's scenes. In terms of recreating the atmosphere of the anime series, this game nails it.\r\nThe gameplay revolves around players assembling a party of characters, customizing their costumes, and curating a selection of camping gear for their adventures. They can undertake missions that focus on camping-oriented objectives, such as cooking specific meals, capturing photos, organizing barbecues, or participating in firewood chopping competitions.\r\nPlayers are allotted a fixed number of turns to prepare for these tasks. During these turns, they have the opportunity to perform actions to enhance their stats, build relationships with fellow campers, and the overall state of the camp all while balancing stamina with rest so they will be better prepared when the task comes.\r\nBased on the side activities players engage in to prepare for tasks, the outcomes of those tasks can either be successful or unsuccessful. At the end of the turns and tasks, the group's performance is rated, which impacts their team rank. Progressing through the game unlocks additional campsites.\r\nAdditionally, as a live service game, Laid-Back Camp All-in-One incorporates familiar features like login bonuses, in-game purchases, and the gacha system mentioned earlier, offering different costumes for the characters. These elements contribute to the ongoing engagement and progression within the game, especially those who would like to immerse themselves in the camping-inspired gameplay.\r\nWhile Laid-Back Camp All -in -one does feature English localization, it's worth noting that the translation quality may not be up to par. Some buttons are weirdly and incorrectly labelled, however, it remains mostly serviceable, allowing a significant portion of players worldwide to enjoy the game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5823673) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Set in a mysterious and dark Aztec-inspired world, Towaga: Among Shadows places players in the role of Chimu, a masked protagonist with supernatural powers, tasked with defending the sacred Temple of Towaga from relentless hordes of shadow creatures.\r\n## Pros\r\n- unique art style\r\n- simple controls but a challenging gameplay\r\n- controller support\r\n- extra game modes like versus multiplayer## Cons\r\n-game is very short\r\n-story feels underdeveloped\r\nThe story revolves around Chimu, the last sole defender of his land, who utilizes his light powers to hold back hordes of darkness and cleanse five shrines from the evil entity known as Metnal. The story is told through cutscenes in-between levels and phases, and all the dialogue must be read. Given the exceptional caliber of art and presentation in this game, it feels unfortunate that the game didn’t have any voice-overs as icing on the cake.\r\nHowever, the story is served more like an afterthought – with most of the elements hidden behind codex entries and not actually present in the actual gameplay, and the game could benefit from a more developed storyline or lore to enhance immersion and provide a stronger sense of purpose.\r\nThe gameplay in Towaga: Among Shadows offers a fresh take on the shoot 'em up genre. As Chimu, players must defend the Temple of Towaga by using their supernatural powers to shoot beams of light at shadow creatures and using abilities, one phase and level at a time. The feeling is literally like pointing a strong flashlight towards enemies for them to burn and die, and it’s visually satisfying to do.\r\nThe controls are simple and intuitive, with players rotating Chimu’s 360 degree aim around the temple using a circular touchpad and tapping the screen to unleash powerful attacks. Precise aiming and timing are crucial to success, as enemies become increasingly challenging with each level. It’s hard to control the accuracy of the beam at first, due to the nature of using touch controls, however in time, players will get used to it. Physical controllers like the Xbox or Playstation gamepads are supported however, which makes aiming a bit easier with the use of physical sticks.\r\nThe gameplay is composed of two main game modes that alternate with each other during the main story: Temple and Aerial. Temple mode is more of a tower defense format and is the harder one to do, as Chimu isn’t allowed to move around and must defend his position, and kill his enemies before it reaches him for damage. Aerial mode follows a more traditional twin-stick shooter layout, with Chimu being able to move around a predefined area for evading enemies.\r\nIn both modes, you can equip one ability out of a selection of six, and use it. Throughout each phase, you can accumulate shards that can be used to upgrade your “build” - such as upgrading your beam’s width, damage, your health points, and mana for abilities. Both modes are fun and provide enough variety for the entirety of the campaign.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5822093) Originally posted on TapTap.",

If there's no cover, blow something up and use the rubble as cover. The destruction is physics-based too, so you don't just blow stuff up by damaging it enough times; you must target critical points if you want to bring down a building quickly and efficiently. So far, weapons, bombs, and abilities can destroy almost everything, which is probably the best destruction I've seen in years, especially after the Battlefield series somewhat downplayed their importance from Bad Company to the more recent games.\r\nRelease Date:\r\nTBA 2023, for PC, Xbox, PlayStation\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5831546) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This isn't a surprise, as the developer, Embark Studios, was founded by former DICE developers, the creators of the Battlefield games. A closed beta has gone live now on Steam, and players can try and request access.\r\n8-minutes gameplay footage above courtesy of IGN\r\n## Pros\r\n- Best-in-class destructible environments that affect the gameplay\r\n- High-quality graphics\r\n- Great sound design with the weapons## Cons\r\n-Players looking for an ultra-fast paced experience may not like the more grounded nature of this game\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nThat these pros and cons are based on the closed beta builds and are subject to change as the game develops and new updates are released.\r\nThe premise of this game is set on a VR televised game show akin to The Hunger Games or the game Apex Legends. The objective of the matches is to provide spectacle and entertainment, and that feeling extends to the players as participants, offering a flashy, high-octane experience for everyone.\r\nImage Courtesy of BloodThirstyLord from Youtube\r\nPlayers in THE FINALS can choose one of three classes: Light, Medium, and Heavy builds. Each build has different abilities, weapons, and gadgets. I'm not sure if the names of the classes will be changed to more flavorful names at release, but for now, they're pretty straightforward. The light build can dash, cloak, and use a grappling hook; the medium build can deploy a dome shield and activate see-through walls recon vision, while the heavy build has a charge attack and ground slam attack.\r\nRegarding the abilities, the flashy visuals are not over-the-top and don't create colorful visual clutter like games such as Overwatch or Valorant. They are mostly grounded and maintain some semblance of realism. Movement feels weighty, and the guns still feel realistic, but there are still ziplines, grappling hooks, fast sprinting, and high-flying elements in the gameplay. All of these results in some kind of a fresh blend of realism and arcade shooting elements. However, It is still a shooter in its core.\r\nSo far, two modes have been showcased in the closed beta. There's Quick Cash, a quick 3v3v3 mode for casual players wanting quick action, and Tournament mode, where two simultaneous four teams of three duke it out, and the top four teams will compete for the last two teams standing. These last two teams will fight in the titular THE FINALS.\r\nPrevious betas have also featured other modes like Cashout, where four teams consisting of three players face off against each other. The objective is to collect cash boxes from either of the two vaults, deposit them in a cash station, and defend the point until the money has been extracted. The team with the most money at the end wins.\r\nThe destruction in the game looks amazing, and it's not just for looks; you can also use it to your advantage. If someone is hiding below, blow up the floor above them. If someone is on the other side of the wall, create an opening by blowing it up. If there's no cover, blow something up and use the rubble as cover.\r\nThe destruction is physics-based too, so you don't just blow stuff up by damaging it enough times; you must target critical points if you want to bring down a building quickly and efficiently. So far, weapons, bombs, and abilities can destroy almost everything, which is probably the best destruction I've seen in years, especially after the Battlefield series somewhat downplayed their importance from Bad Company to the more recent games.\r\nTHE FINALS is looking mighty good for now, standing out as a shooter in the midst of a highly saturated market. It is currently running a closed beta, and you can request to participate on Steam, but it's only available for PC. As for the release date, all we know is that it's scheduled for 2023 for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, but there is no exact date yet.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5831636) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Layers of Fear\r\nGraphics & Music\r\nLayers of Fear (2023) is a psychological horror game that takes players on a chilling journey through the twisted minds of various artists; the painter, the daughter, the musician, and the actor.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Stunning graphics\r\n- Immersive audio design\r\n- Creepy and haunting atmosphere\r\n- Psychological terror as the main method of scaring the player\r\n- Safe mode option for a harmless psychological horror experience## Cons\r\n-Puzzles are simple\r\n-Pacing can be too slow\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nThe game occasionally employs jump scares\r\nLayers of Fear (2023) is a remake of the original two games plus its DLC and introduces a reimagined story, stunning visuals, and a comprehensive package that will captivate fans of the series, while serving as a good entry point for newcomers.\r\nLayers of Fear showcases the next-gen potential of Unreal Engine 5, offering stunning visuals that push the boundaries of realism. The use of the Lumen system for dynamic illumination and reflections creates an immersive world filled with highly detailed textures and realistic particle effects. Each stroke of the brush, every speck of dust, is rendered with astonishing fidelity that make the in-game graphics look like a pre-rendered cutscene, making it easy to forget that you're playing a video game. The game's visual design seamlessly blends reality with the surreal, as players are constantly bombarded with nightmarish visions and mind-bending transitions.\r\nThe core gameplay of Layers of Fears is a game of exploration and discovery. As players assume the role of the various artists, starting with the writer and painter, they venture through a dark and foreboding mansion, slowly unraveling the layers of the protagonists’ disturbed psyche.\r\nThe game's minimalist design when it comes to story progression, quest markers, and navigation enhances the sense of isolation and vulnerability, placing emphasis on atmospheric exploration and storytelling rather than extensive gameplay mechanics.\r\nThe game's environments are meticulously crafted, with each room and corridor oozing with a sense of dread and unease. From decaying paintings to the dimly lit rooms, every detail contributes to the haunting atmosphere. The combination of eerie sound effects - the creaking of wood, rats wandering about, unsettling music, and masterful voice acting - elevates the immersion, drawing players deeper into the nightmarish world.\r\nLayers of Fear's audio design is a masterpiece in its own right. From the haunting soundtrack that combines solemn violin and piano themes to the unsettling sound effects that send chills down your spine, every auditory element is carefully crafted to enhance the atmosphere and immersion. The use of sound, including ambient noises, distant whispers, and distorted cries, heightens the sense of unease and adds another layer of depth to the experience.\r\nThroughout the journey, players will encounter a series of puzzles and challenges. Some of these puzzles involve finding the appropriate item or piece of information to progress, such as a locked chest or discovering the combination to a locked door. In certain challenges, the use of the antique flashlight, which is obtained early in the game, is required to reveal hidden messages and secrets within the levels.\r\nWhile the puzzles are not particularly complex, they are made challenging enough thanks to the minimalistic nature of the gameplay. They serve as a means to progress the narrative, involve the player, and add layers of intrigue to the experience. The real focus, however, lies in the exploration of the protagonists’ psyche and the unraveling of their tragic stories.\r\nLayers of Fear excels at creating a psychological horror experience that leaves players feeling unsettled and on edge. The game employs a range of techniques, including my not so favorite jump scares, disorienting camera angles, and hallucinatory transitions, to keep players constantly guessing and questioning the characters’ perception of reality. It messes with your head in the most effective and disturbing ways. You might find yourself heading back to a door, only to find out the room before you have changed, A previous opening that has since closed as soon as you turn back to it, or perhaps a painting that has suddenly changed.\r\nWhile Layers of Fear may not rely heavily on combat or traditional survival horror mechanics and the game effectively conveys a sense of psychological terror, there are still direct threats present in the later parts of the story, and you need to use your trusty antique flashlight to burn these threats akin to Alan Wake’s flashlight mechanic.A gameplay element that’s entirely optional — given that you can activate a “Safe Mode” in the settings to emphasize the psychological aspects of horror, immersing players in a narrative-driven experience without the constant fear of imminent danger.\r\nLayers of Fear is the longest game in the series thus far, as it combines the reimagined versions of the two previous games and the DLC into one comprehensive package. However, with a playtime of around 10 hours, the majority of its length is attributed to the slow pacing of the game and story. Personally, I found the pacing to be a bit slow.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5851824) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Ace RacerGlobal\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nAce Racer, developed and published by NetEase, is a mobile arcade racing game that aims to combine simple controls, high-octane street racing, and arcade-style abilities that vary from vehicle to vehicle. Featuring AAA levels of graphics, dynamic races, and a plethora of customization options.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Thrilling and fun arcade-style racing\r\n- Plenty of customization options with your character and cars\r\n- Multiplayer mode, solo or team based matchmaking## Cons\r\n-Matchmaking is a bit unbalanced, especially when getting matched with higher leveled players\r\nAce Racer boasts stunning graphics that rival even console racing games in terms of fidelity and effects, and it runs very smoothly and accordingly on my Snapdragon 888, allowing for max visuals and 60fps performance at the same time. From the detailed environments to the sleek and realistic car models, the game's visual presentation is top-notch. The attention to detail is evident in the way the cars speed and drift around, the dynamic lighting effects, and the fluid animations.\r\nThe game offers an arcade-style racing experience that is both accessible to newcomers and challenging for seasoned players. For starters, the cars auto accelerate in this game, so players only need to worry about cornering or making turns. The controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing for a choice between manual drifting, and automated drifting when there are corners. I’ve found both choices equally as compelling, and even the automated drifting is enough for my needs. The game strikes a balance between realistic visuals and fun arcade gameplay, providing an enjoyable racing experience without sacrificing the accessibility and excitement.\r\nDrifting is important in this game. Not only is it essential for efficient cornering, but it is also required to replenish your Nitro meter. Using Nitro in turn refills your ultimate meter, making drifting the single most important gameplay element in racing.\r\nThese nitro-fueled races are fast-paced, action-packed, and filled with thrilling moments as you navigate through a variety of race tracks with different terrains. Each race track offers a unique and challenging experience, featuring a plethora of obstacles, barricades, and elements that keep players on their toes. Additionally, some tracks present alternate routes, adding an exciting risk-reward dynamic to the gameplay. Players can choose between taking the longer, easier route or attempting a daring long ramp jump, which carries the risk of not reaching the other end and falling down the bridge.\r\nThe game offers a fully licensed iconic collection of real-life and also fictional cars available for players to choose from as part of their ride in the game. Each car is further customizable and upgradeable for better performance as suited best by the players. The collection includes but is not limited to Porsche 911, Nissan GT-R, and other real-life luxury rides. Some of these rides have been tweaked and are combined versions of real-time classic cars added to the game by developers.\r\nNot only that, but Ace Racer also allows you to customize your racer, including their looks, cosmetics, and overall appearance. The game goes the extra mile to include the actual driver in the game's presentation, adding a personal touch and enhancing the immersive experience.\r\nAside from Solo Races and Career mode time-attack levels, Ace Racer embraces multiplayer elements, allowing players to compete against each other, form teams, and participate in 3vs3 matches. The multiplayer mode offers the opportunity to challenge friends or other players in real-time races, adding a competitive aspect to the game. Collaborating with a partner in the limited-time Duo Rally mode (Available only from June 16 to June 22 for now) enhances the teamwork experience, as players work together to secure victory and share the excitement of winning.\r\nThe multiplayer component adds replayability and social interaction, as players can join racing clubs, compete in leaderboards, and engage in friendly rivalries. The ability to strategize and coordinate with teammates further enhances the depth of the gameplay. However, you are subject to the gears and vehicle levels of other players. This can sometimes lead to an uneven playing field, where players with higher-level vehicles may have an advantage over those with lower-level ones. It's important to keep in mind that this aspect of the game can impact the overall competitiveness and fairness of the races.\r\nAce Racer follows a live service model, continuously providing updates and new content to keep players engaged. The game introduces regular events, challenges, in-game purchases, and limited-time game modes to keep the experience fresh and dynamic.\r\nSeasonal updates, such as the new Season 3, bring new vehicles, outfits, and gameplay features that expand the game's offerings.\r\nOne of the main highlights in Season 3 is the Garage system.\r\nPlayers can unlock and customize their in-game garages, adding vehicles, outfits, rims, furniture, and even swimming pools. This feature allows for more personalization and self-expression, giving players the ability to showcase their style and achievements. The Garage system adds a sense of ownership and serves as a hub for players to admire their collection of vehicles and customize their surroundings.\r\nSeason 3 also introduces two exciting new vehicles: the Paladin and the Beach Wayfarer.\r\nThe Paladin, obtained through a Presale Event and In-game purchases, offers unique features and abilities, providing players with an advantage on the race tracks. On the other hand, the Beach Wayfarer, acquired from Supply Chests, is tailored for beach racing and exploration, adding a thematic touch to the game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5848140) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Extraction\r\nRainbow Six: Extraction, the latest installment in the critically acclaimed Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series, takes a bold step into the realm of PvE squad-based cooperative gameplay.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Engaging PvE action\r\n- Emergent mission system\r\n- Novel game mechanics involving characters deaths and respawns\r\n- Impressive graphics while maintaining smooth performance## Cons\r\n-Gets repetitive after a short while\r\n-Somewhat grindy progression\r\n-No more content updates\r\nDeveloped and published by Ubisoft, Rainbow Six: Extraction brings together the tactical prowess and intensity of Rainbow Six Siege with a thrilling PvE (Player vs. Environment) experience, heavily inspired by the successful limited-time game mode, Outbreak, in Rainbow Six Siege, Extraction expands upon that cooperative gameplay experience.\r\nRainbow Six: Extraction features graphics that are comparable to its predecessor, Rainbow Six: Siege, as both games utilize the same AnvilNext game engine. The visual fidelity in Extraction maintains the high standard set by Siege, with detailed environments, realistic but somewhat stylized character models, and impressive lighting effects heavily accentuated by the game’s dark atmosphere. All of these are achieved without sacrificing performance, as Extraction performs smoothly, perhaps just as smooth as Siege.\r\nExtraction introduces a refreshing change to the traditional Rainbow Six formula by emphasizing tactical teamwork and coordination against a common enemy: the enigmatic alien threat known as the Archaeans. Players form a team of three operators — characters taken from Rainbow Six: Siege, each possessing unique gadgets and abilities that can complement one another. The synergy among teammates becomes crucial as you embark on more difficult missions ranging from gathering intel and hunting down elite enemies, to planting bombs and saving trapped operators in various infected zones. The level design is well-crafted, featuring intricate maps with multiple entry points, destructible environment, and environmental hazards that further challenge players.\r\nThe whole mission format is divided into multiple phases/areas, and the team can call for extraction at any point in the mission. Players can choose to complete all objectives, skip some or all of them and move on to the next area if continuing is not viable, or they can opt to completely call off the mission by extracting to save their gathered experience if the going gets tough. This adds a risk and reward element, as well as a sense of emergent storytelling to the gameplay where not everything must be completed and not everything needs to reset back from start.\r\nThe combat encounters are intense, especially when facing the diverse horde of alien threats – all while under pressure in doing the varying objectives. The ability to weaken or eliminate these threats by targeting their nests adds a layer of strategy, as you must decide when to go for the objective, when to extract, and when to thin out the enemy's numbers.\r\nI was actually going in with low expectations for the game, considering the mixed receptions it received when it originally launched back in 2022. However, with the game's recent release on Steam and a 75% off discount across all platforms, I was surprised at how fun it is. The game has already been abandoned even at this early stage, so it's not going to receive any further content or updates. However, for the content it already has, it's still a fun game to play, especially if the price is right.\r\nAside from the PvE action, Extraction offers an engaging progression system that encourages players to play over and over. As they successfully complete missions, players can earn experience that unlock new operators, upgrades, and customization options. Each operator possesses unique abilities, weapons, and loadout choices — similar to their Rainbow Six: Siege counterparts but tweaked for PvE gameplay. It provides diverse playstyles and encourages experimentation.\r\nMy favorite feature so far is that Rainbow Six: Extraction introduces a compelling operator rescue and health mechanic that adds depth and urgency to the gameplay. In the game, operators can become trapped or captured by the Archaean threat if they “die” on a mission, locking the operator for use by the player unless a rescue mission is mounted.\r\nThe next time you play the same map, a rescue mission is initiated as one of the objectives, the player's team must navigate through the infected zone, battling Archaean enemies along the way. Once the operator is found, a rescue process begins. The extraction is a multi-step procedure that involves securing and escorting the operator to a designated extraction point.\r\nAlong with the rescue mechanic, the health system also ensures that players cannot play the same operators repeatedly. Taking damage during missions will gradually reduce their overall health and effectiveness, requiring a period of recovery.\r\nWhile Extraction's cooperative gameplay mechanics are solid, the AI is somewhat rudimentary, which is unfortunate since this is primarily a PvE game. Still, the infected aliens are supposed to be mindless anyway, so it isn’t really game or immersion breaking. It does get repetitive after a short while, especially since the unlocks are few and far between, and you're encouraged to use different operators for every mission, which further slows the progression for each character. It is advisable to play this with friends for an added fun factor.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5856126) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The story sets up the premise for their segmented journey, where the gameplay mechanics and challenges revolve around these distinct segments. There isn't much emphasis on storytelling, as the game primarily revolves around hack-and-slash action.\r\nMatilda and Amanda have different fighting styles, with Matilda excelling in swords while Amanda is a skilled gunslinger. The controls are intentionally simplified, focusing on basic attacks, dashes, and a limited number of combination moves for special skills using the face buttons – all with cooldowns.\r\nThe Segment Twins incorporates an experience point system to unlock skills, and currency system to upgrade your characters’ stats – which are shared between both characters. As players accumulate experience points, they can level up their characters and gain access to new abilities. However, the game introduces a challenging twist I’ve never seen before—taking damage causes players to lose experience points, potentially losing newly acquired skills as quickly as they are obtained. This risk-reward mechanic adds an extra layer of tension and decision-making during combat encounters. This means that skills unlocked are not permanent, and can be locked again if you lose enough XP points.\r\nThe Segment Twins offer a moderate level of replayability, with each world comprising around 20 stages and a boss fight at the end. Completing the game unlocks new worlds, introducing new segments and enemies. However, due to the repetitive nature of combat and the lack of significant gameplay variations, prolonged sessions can be unsustainable. Players seeking a short burst of fast-paced action and challenges will find enjoyment, especially since individual levels are easily completed in under a minute, but those looking for addicting gameplay mechanics and long play time may be left wanting.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5856420) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "BattleBit Remastered\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nTest\r\nBattleBit Remastered is a massive multiplayer first-person shooter that combines elements of the classic Battlefield games with its own unique  blocky twist.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Up to 254 players (127 vs 127 matches)\r\n- Immersive sound design\r\n- Smooth gunplay\r\n- Destructible environments\r\n- Vehicular warfare on top of infantry\r\n- Gun customization## Cons\r\n-minor crashes\r\n-low poly graphics\r\n-progression needs work\r\n-map balance and enemy visibility needs more work\r\nWhile still in its early access stage, BattleBit Remastered showcases potential for an exciting and dynamic gameplay experience. With its low-poly graphics and immersive sound design, the game aims to deliver a fast-paced and action-packed experience for up to 254 players per server.\r\nBattleBit Remastered's low-poly graphics evoke a distinct visual style reminiscent of games like LEGO, Roblox, or Minecraft. While this style may make it challenging to spot enemies at times due to reduced visual detail, it's worth noting that much of the visual clutter that goes along the usual AAA high fidelity games are out of the way, so its an even trade-off. Furthermore, the clean and streamlined visuals help maintain high performance and optimize the game for its impressive player count, as well as ease up development costs and time.\r\nSimilar to how Battlefield's sound design made a name for itself, the immersive sound design in BattleBit Remastered deserves commendation. Realistic audio cues, explosions, and gun sounds create a heightened sense of immersion, further enhancing the chaotic battlefield atmosphere. The strategic use of sound becomes crucial for players to identify threats, communicate with teammates, and immerse themselves fully in the game's environment. Except for the low-poly visuals, everything in this game is of a high degree of detail and possesses a somewhat arcade-like realism.\r\nBattleBit Remastered introduces players to a destructible environment, allowing for strategic destruction and environmental manipulation. The ability to shape the battlefield adds a layer of depth and tactical decision-making to gameplay. The game supports vehicular combat with a variety of tanks, helicopters, transports, and sea vehicles in some game modes, offering players diverse options for traversing the battlefield and engaging in intense battles.\r\nThe gunplay is amazing; it feels fluid to control, and the shots are accurately represented in the gameplay. The recoil now feels just right, not overpoweredly easy like in COD, but also not overly difficult to control like in CSGO. However, due to the massive player matches, long-range engagements and limited block visuals, hitting an enemy and getting a kill is much harder than usual.\r\nIn addition, it also adapts one mechanic from the more hardcore shooters in the FPS genre, which is the tactical reload or magazine cycling. When a player runs out of ammunition in their current magazine, they can perform a tactical reload, discarding the partially expended magazine and replacing it with a fresh one. However, the discarded magazine still holds any remaining rounds and will be cycled back, unless they manually move the bullets which will take time.\r\nThe class system, featuring Assault, Medic, Recon, Engineer, and Support roles, harkens back to traditional Battlefield games, providing players with distinct playstyles and encouraging teamwork. Additionally, the game offers familiar game modes like Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Rush, which provide a mix of large-scale battles and focused objectives.\r\nBattleBit Remastered also features proximity-based voice chat that even persists a few seconds after death (entirely optional for the player) facilitating real-time communication with both friendlies and enemies. This feature promotes coordination, enhances immersion, and adds to the overall tactical experience on the battlefield, as well as fun factor with hilarious on-mic death moments with other players.\r\nThe game's progression system allows players to unlock new attachments and gadgets by increasing their kill count and rank. While this system offers a sense of achievement and rewards dedicated players, it may pose challenges for newcomers who find themselves matched against experienced players with a plethora of unlocked gear. This imbalance can lead to frustration, and it would benefit the game's overall experience if the developers address this issue in future updates.\r\nCustomization is another aspect that BattleBit Remastered excels at. With over 45 weapons and extensive customization options (and still counting), players can tailor their loadouts to their preferred playstyle. This level of customization adds depth and personalization to the gameplay experience, allowing players to adapt their weapons to different combat situations. Prefer close quarters? Equip a 1x scope. Prefer long range engagements? Install a recoil compensator and long range scope.\r\nBattleBit Remastered, despite being in early access, demonstrates a lot of potential as a multiplayer FPS. Its unique combination of low-poly visuals, immersive sound design, and large-scale battles creates an engaging and fast-paced gameplay experience. I've encountered occasional crashes when I first initialized the game, but since then, it has worked flawlessly so far, with smooth performances during gameplay.\r\nWhile there are huge areas for improvement, such as balancing the progression system for new players, more balanced maps, and a more refined matchmaking, the game showcases promising features and mechanics that could capitalize on a market currently devoid of a proper Battlefield-like game. As the development progresses, BattleBit Remastered has the opportunity to refine its gameplay, address player feedback, and solidify its position as a competitive multiplayer shooter.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5852708) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "VALORANT Mobile\r\n9.1\r\nMultiplayer\r\nFast-paced\r\nPre-register\r\nValorant is coming with a new update (Patch 7.0) this June 27, which introduces the highly requested Team Deathmatch mode along with three exclusive maps made specifically for the game mode: Piazza, District, and Kasbah. In terms of aesthetics, Piazza bears a resemblance to Ascent with its European architecture, District resembles Split with its urban Japanese setting, and Kasbah shares similarities with Bind with its African location.\r\nUnlike the standard free-for-all Deathmatch where players compete to reach 40 kills or achieve the most kills within a 9-minute timeframe, Team Deathmatch in Valorant puts players in 5v5 team matches. The objective is for a team to reach 100 kills or have the highest kill count after 9 and a half minutes to emerge as the winners. Additionally, players can now use their abilities and pick up orbs that grant either ability cooldown reduction or health recovery.\r\nThere is no in-game economy, and players can choose their loadout of weapons at the start of the match or after respawning. As the match progresses, more weapons become available to equip.\r\nOf course, not every agent will be equally balanced in this game mode, especially those that focus more on utility rather than killing. It is not yet known if these abilities will be tweaked specifically for team deathmatch, or if a ranked variant will be introduced in the future. However, for now, it appears that the team deathmatch mode will resemble other game modes such as traditional Deathmatch, Spike Rush, and Swift Play, which are primarily designed for fun and casual gameplay.\r\nAs for the mobile version, it has been two years since the confirmation that Valorant would be coming to mobile, and it has been a year since a closed beta test was conducted in the China region. However, as of now, there still hasn't been any concrete news about its official release. Currently, the main focus is on the PC version of the game, as well as bringing the shooter into PC Gamepass and introducing new updates such as the Team Deathmatch game mode.\r\nValorant remains one of the most popular PC game titles in the world, boasting approximately 20 million monthly players and consistently ranking in the top 10 most-watched games on Twitch. Even three years after its initial release, it continues to attract a wide variety of players, including both casual and competitive gamers.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5863347) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The enemy designs are varied, differing in mannerisms, attack patterns, and visual design, showcasing imaginative creatures and challenging bosses that provide both visual appeal and gameplay diversity.\r\nAt its core, Fireball Wizard is an action-packed platformer with shoot'em up elements. Controlling a wizard armed with fireball attacks and elemental spells, players navigate through a series of handcrafted and nostalgia-inducing levels, battling enemies, overcoming environmental obstacles, and uncovering secrets.\r\nThe controls are very simple: players can move left and right, shoot fireballs, jump, and cast spells. Despite the player controlling wizards equipped with wands and shooting fireballs, Fireball Wizard actually feels like a shoot'em up game, with the fireballs shooting in a straight line and as fast as the player can press the buttons. The difficulty level is high, demanding players' coordination, reflexes, and strategic thinking.\r\nThroughout the adventure, players will encounter four worlds and over 40 levels filled with enemies, obstacles, and secrets waiting to be discovered. Each world culminates in a challenging boss fight with its own unique mechanics and patterns, providing intense and strategic encounters that can definitely pose a challenge. The challenging old-school gameplay will push your skills to the limit as you jump, shoot fireballs, and navigate treacherous platforms. In addition to the main levels, Fireball Wizard also includes side game modes such as a Flappy Bird copy or a time attack mode spanning all levels and allowing only one life.\r\nThe game is available for PC at around $6 at the time of writing, and the first 10 levels are free to play on Android and iOS, with an in-app purchase of $5 to unlock the full game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5868748) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This adaptation to touch controls is well-executed, providing players with a seamless experience on their mobile devices. Although the game retains its core mechanics and charm, it introduces some changes, including free-to-play elements and gacha mechanics. While Neon Abyss: Infinite shows great promise, it is important to note that the game is in Early Access, and therefore, still requires optimization and improvement.\r\nNeon Abyss: Infinite takes place in a futuristic and colorful world where players assume the role of a member of the Grim Squad, tasked with descending into the depths of the Abyss to defeat the New Gods.\r\nNeon Abyss: Infinite maintains its retro-inspired pixel art style, transporting players in a vibrant and neon-lit cyberpunk world with Greek mythology undertones. The visuals are colorful, complemented by neon lighting effects that add a lot of personality to the cyberpunk aesthetic. The enemy designs are varied, from the simple flying mobs to the dynamically generated boss fights. The game's soundtrack is an energetic mix of electronic beats and catchy tunes that enhance the fast-paced nature of the gameplay. However, while the game’s levels are procedurally generated, the game suffers for repetitive looking layouts and elements, with minor reskins and little to no variation in gameplay.\r\nCompared to the original version, Neon Abyss: Infinite stays true to its roots, offering the same gameplay experience as its PC and console counterparts. Players venture through procedurally generated levels filled with enemies, power-ups, and challenging bosses.\r\nNeon Abyss: Infinite incorporates roguelike elements, meaning that each run is unique, with randomly generated rooms, enemy placements, and item drops.

The game also introduces eggs that can hatch into various companions after some time, and if it results in a successful hatch, can provide different bonuses and support during battles\r\nUnlike many PC and console games that have been ported to mobile and lost their multiplayer functionality, Neon Abyss: Infinite still offers both single-player and cooperative multiplayer modes. This allows players to team up with friends and tackle the challenges of the Abyss together.\r\nThe touch controls are well-designed, offering customization options and quality of life features like auto jump and auto fire. These additions compensate for the loss of fine control when transitioning from physical controllers to touch controls. However, it is worth mentioning that while supported, using physical controllers in this version lacks some functionality, such as UI navigation, and suffers from noticeable input lag, which hampers the overall experience.\r\nOne of the surprising changes in Neon Abyss: Infinite is the shift to a free-to-play model with added cosmetics and gacha mechanics, which aren’t entirely needed to enjoy the game. This move aims to make the game more accessible to mobile gamers and capitalize on the popularity of these monetization methods.\r\nAs an Early Access title, Neon Abyss: Infinite has room for improvement. Performance issues, such as massive frame drops and input latency when using physical controllers, hamper the gameplay experience. These technical shortcomings need to be addressed promptly by the time the game is officially released. Additionally, the shift to a free-to-play model with gacha mechanics presents an opportunity to reach a wider audience but must be carefully balanced to avoid pay-to-win scenarios.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5876825) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players embark on missions with diverse objectives, and each level is procedurally generated, providing a unique experience with every playthrough. To control their character, players click on tiles to move, interact with objects, or attack hostile units. The combat mechanics are methodical, demanding strategic positioning and thorough preparation. Ammo is scarce and reloading at the right time is essential.

However, the game itself remains the same, with improvements and changes, particularly in the character's appearance and movement on the map.\r\nQuasimorph's premise, involving a spreading disease, space stations, fever, and interdimensional demons, sets the stage for an intense and mysterious atmosphere. In Quasimorph, players would undertake missions within the infected space stations to uncover the dark secret behind the disease and the rifts to Bramphatur. The turn-based gameplay mechanics would allow for strategic decision-making, emphasizing the importance of planning and tactics to survive each encounter.\r\nThe graphics feature retro-inspired pixelated art that authentically replicates the visual style of the late 90s to the early 2000s. The game also incorporates 3D graphics and utilizes 2D isometric elements in certain aspects. It has this distinct tone that genuinely feels nostalgic, and brings you back to these golden days of gaming.  However, in contrast to the earlier footage of the game, the character sprite has been updated to include rotation and movement animations. Despite this improvement, I find that the movement feels somewhat jarring, resulting in a somewhat clunky gameplay experience.\r\nThe gameplay of Quasimorph is a top-down turn-based shooter that draws heavy inspiration from classic titles like Fallout 1 and 2. Players embark on missions with diverse objectives, and each level is procedurally generated, providing a unique experience with every playthrough. To control their character, players click on tiles to move, interact with objects, or attack hostile units. The combat mechanics are methodical, demanding strategic positioning and thorough preparation.\r\nAmmo is scarce and reloading at the right time is essential. These elements combine to create intense and rewarding encounters against enemies, offering a sense of satisfaction after each battle. However, it's important to note that the game can become highly challenging, and players should expect frequent deaths. As a result, Quasimorph may not appeal to everyone, particularly those seeking a more casual gaming experience.\r\nThere is an inventory system where you can loot, equip, and interact with items. Additionally, the game incorporates a clever hardcore health system that tracks injuries for each body part. This is a hardcore element, as you need to stabilize wounds, patch them up, or maybe even counter infections with antibiotics. Inventory management plays a significant role in the gameplay, emphasizing the extraction-style mechanics.\r\nPlayers must carefully consider what items to bring on missions, as they risk losing everything upon death. This aspect encourages strategic decision-making and prioritization, forcing players to assess the value of each item and determine what is worth bringing back if they survive the mission.\r\nThe extraction twist adds an extra layer of risk and reward to the game. If a player dies during a mission, they would lose everything they had acquired, adding a high-stakes element to the gameplay. However, if they manage to survive, they would be able to keep all the loot they gathered, providing the main progression element and incentive for surviving and completing missions.\r\nI have only explored a small part of the game while playing the demo. However, the full game is designed to offer players the ability to explore other planetary bases, secret labs, and the wreckage of spaceships across the solar system using their ships. This exploration allows players to discover new technologies, abilities, and other items that can help them level the playing field during operations.\r\nNow, onto my main gripes. The game is missing a significant quality-of-life feature: there is no option to skip through text to display everything instantly. You are left with two choices: either endure the painfully slow text scrolling or skip the entire dialogue altogether. It's surprising that such a feature was overlooked, almost as if nobody tested the game. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, the game feels mechanically clunky when it comes to moving your character around the levels.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5883329) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The core gameplay revolves around navigating a tile-based map, strategically moving your hero across various terrains and encountering both friend and foe. The procedurally generated world every run ensures that each playthrough feels fresh and unpredictable. Throughout the game, you will have encounters with various friendly or neutral beings, many of whom offer you a choice between different bonuses and items to purchase, such as new cards, minions, power-ups, or upgrades.\r\nEncounters with enemies initiate turn-based strategic card battles. The combat system is straightforward. Player cards will attack the enemy card in front of them on the table, taking into account their offensive and defensive stats. If there is no opposing card present, such as when the spot is empty or the opposing card has been defeated, attacks will directly target the opposing hero unit.\r\nAt the end of each turn, both heroes inevitably attack each other. The complexity and game-changing factors on the other hand comes from the properties of the individual cards, which determine how the cards respond and impact the battle. For instance, some cards have additional attacks against adjacent cards, while others provide additional health points to neighboring cards. There are even cards with a \"revenge\" trait, which means that upon dying, they deal a final blow to hostile cards.

    "body": "Looper Tactics\r\nLooper Tactics is a turn-based strategy card game infused with roguelike elements, and presents players with a journey through a procedurally generated world of eternal life and death.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Procedurally generated world\r\n- Engaging deck building and strategic card gameplay\r\n- Roguelike but with emphasis on continuity and persistent progression## Cons\r\n-Lack of unique or special mechanics\r\n-Noticeably lacking quality-of-life features\r\n-Some story elements feel gimmicky\r\n## 📝Notable points: That these pros and cons are based on Demo build and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product\r\nLooper Tactics aims to combine turn-based strategy and roguelike mechanics, providing an interesting twist on traditional deck building. Visually, Looper Tactics adopts a minimalist art style with a focus on simplicity. The game's aesthetics, while not groundbreaking, effectively convey the atmosphere of an otherworldly realm as well as a tabletop RPG setting. The tile-based maps are visually distinct, with each tile clearly represented. Although the game's graphics are not visually stunning, they serve their purpose by providing clarity and facilitating gameplay understanding.\r\nThe core gameplay revolves around navigating a tile-based map, strategically moving your hero across various terrains and encountering both friend and foe. The worlds are separated into different class levels B, A, S, and SS. And must all be completed to face the final boss. The procedurally generated world every run ensures that each playthrough feels fresh and unpredictable. Throughout the game, you will have encounters with various friendly or neutral beings, many of whom offer you a choice between different bonuses and items to purchase, such as new cards, minions, power-ups, or upgrades.\r\nEncounters with enemies initiate turn-based strategic card battles. The combat system is straightforward. Player cards will attack the enemy card in front of them on the table, taking into account their offensive and defensive stats. If there is no opposing card present, such as when the spot is empty or the opposing card has been defeated, attacks will directly target the opposing hero unit.\r\nAt the end of each turn, both heroes inevitably attack each other. The complexity and game-changing factors on the other hand comes from the properties of the individual cards, which determine how the cards respond and impact the battle. For instance, some cards have additional attacks against adjacent cards, while others provide additional health points to neighboring cards. There are even cards with a \"revenge\" trait, which means that upon dying, they deal a final blow to hostile cards. The ultimate objective is to deplete the health points of the enemy heroes.\r\nThe persistent health points across battles and the ability to carry over enhancements between cycles add an additional layer of depth and continuity to the gameplay. Each defeat becomes a learning experience, pushing players to refine their strategies and optimize their deck compositions.\r\nAs part of the roguelike experience, Looper Tactics ensures that each playthrough is unique, with the procedurally generated world offering fresh challenges and surprises. As players progress through the game, they unlock new cards, minions, and power-ups, allowing for greater customization and strategic depth in subsequent playthroughs. This sense of progression and growth incentivizes multiple replays, as players strive to build more powerful and versatile decks.\r\nThe story revolves around the concept of being trapped in an eternal cycle of death and resurrection, seeking freedom from the confines of this illusory trap. Looper Tactics attempts to incorporate a self-aware and unconventional narrative, aiming to challenge players' perceptions and expectations. While the premise is intriguing, the execution falls short. Although the game attempts to introduce twists and mind-bending sequences such as visual glitches and programming code references, they feel gimmicky and come across as forced and pretentious.\r\nWhile the game is engaging and fun to play like many other decent deck-building games out there, it is missing some quality-of-life features. One such feature is the ability to cancel actions. Once you place a card on the table, you are unable to retrieve it, even if the move has not yet been finalized. This limitation also applies to skills in the game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5878272) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "BrownDust2 - Adventure RPG\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nPC Version\r\nBrown Dust 2, the somewhat both direct and spiritual successor to the popular Brave 9 / Brown Dust, takes players on a grander journey filled with time travel, world-traveling elements, and captivating narratives.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Stunning HD-2D Graphics\r\n- Strategic Turn-Based Combat\r\n- Waifu elements while still having male characters to collect\r\n- Diverse localization options (english, japanese, korean, chinese text; japanese and korean voice-overs)\r\n- Quality of life features such as auto-walk and supports both portrait and landscape modes## Cons\r\n-Limited story focus by having multiple unrelated story packs instead of one connected grand story\r\n-Performance issues\r\nDeveloped with a unique HD-2D art style, Brown Dust 2 is a gacha RPG game that offers a visually stunning experience that combines detailed 2D artwork with beautiful 3D environments reminiscent of the acclaimed Octopath Traveler series.\r\nBrown Dust 2 expands upon the world established in its predecessor, Brave 9 (also called Brown Dust), while introducing new timelines and places. While the story is standalone, it references the time travel and world-traveling elements previously set up, adding variety and intrigue to the narrative.\r\nThe main story is set in the continent of Svern, which was once under the rule of the Karian Empire but now faces an impending war and the encroaching shadow of dark magic. The fate of the Five Kingdoms hangs in the balance, with tensions rising and the peaceful Lugo village under threat.\r\nHowever, there are many other story packs in various timelines that offer players a diverse range of adventures, allowing them to explore different facets of the game's lore. It is worth mentioning that some players may miss the continuation of the story from Brave 9, particularly the mercenary characters featured in that game, especially after being featured as a slight nod in the game’s tutorial segment.\r\nBrown Dust 2 shines with its breathtaking HD-2D graphics. The fusion of highly detailed 2D character artwork and 3D environments creates a visually stunning world that draws players into the game's universe and is a good blend of retro and modernity. The flashy skill animations for each character bring battles to life with dynamic and visually pleasing effects. The art style, reminiscent of Octopath Traveler, showcases meticulous attention to detail, showered with modern visual effects like motion blur, bloom, and impressive artwork.\r\nBrown Dust 2 features turn-based combat with strategic tile-based positioning, adding a layer of tactical depth to battles. Players must carefully consider the positioning of their characters to optimize their skills and abilities, even utilizing skills such as knockback or AOE attacks, to further emphasize the position-based combat.\r\nAssembling a team of companions characters is the main core aspect of the gameplay. These characters can be collected through various means, including gameplay progression, gacha mechanics, or in-app purchases. Each companion possesses unique abilities, skills, and attributes, allowing players to create diverse and powerful teams. The gacha element adds a familiar element of excitement and anticipation as players aim to obtain rare pulls, however in my experience it is not a hard requirement to progress in the game. It is worth noting that while the game incorporates waifu elements, it also includes male characters, providing a wide selection for players to choose from.\r\nThe semi-open world exploration in Brown Dust 2 sets it apart from other gacha games. Instead of a linear level-based mission design, players can freely explore the game world, encountering various quests and challenges along the way. This exploration aspect adds freedom to the gameplay, allowing players to appreciate the HD-2D world even more.\r\nThe inclusion of quality of life features, such as auto-walk to quest destinations and fast-forwarding dialogues, streamlines the gameplay experience, making it more convenient for players looking to skip parts that they want to skip. The inclusion of both horizontal and vertical gameplay modes enhances flexibility, allowing players to enjoy the game on both device orientations. It is not a seamless transition as you will need to restart the game to switch orientations, and constantly switching between two orientations can be jarring because of two different UI schemes.\r\nBrown Dust 2 incorporates the familiar gacha system found in many mobile RPG games. Players can acquire new companions and items through summons using in-game currency or premium resources. The gacha system adds a collectible aspect to the game, enticing players to aim for rare and powerful characters. While the gacha element may appeal to some players, it is important to note that the game can be enjoyed without spending real money. As a free-to-play experience, Brown Dust 2 provides enjoyable gameplay for those willing to invest time and embrace the challenge that comes with playing without additional purchases.\r\nThe game offers various localization options, including Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese, catering to a diverse player base. Additionally, players can choose between Japanese and Korean voice-over options, adding immersion and personalization to the gameplay experience.\r\nWhile I haven’t personally experienced this myself, it is worth mentioning that some players have reported performance issues on certain devices. These issues include sluggishness, increased battery consumption, occasional crashes, and bugs. The game's demanding nature on hardware may pose challenges for some players. However, it is important to note that performance can vary depending on device specifications and software configurations. Developers may actively address these issues through updates to improve the overall gameplay experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5908118) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It’s not that pleasing to the eyes and is supposed to add to the game’s bleak atmosphere. Additionally, the game also features a fitting hauntingly depressing soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere and helps to create a sense of the cataclysmic world.\r\nOver the years, humanity has developed resilience against the mutating and lurking pale monsters within the mysterious mist that envelops the last remaining human city. However, these monsters have grown stronger, posing an even greater threat. In this strategy game, players will take on the role of leading the defense of the last human city. Recognizing that mere defense is insufficient, they will also embark on an expedition into the ruins of a forgotten kingdom, with the ultimate goal of reclaiming our world and constructing fortresses to ensure protection.\r\nI played the demo, which consisted of the first two missions of the game.

The Lego-style system is enjoyable to work with and gives the feeling of playing a sandbox game where you have the freedom to modularly construct walls and structures. However, it is limiting that it only allows for building at two angles, lacking the ability for diagonal placement or free rotation of structures. Additionally, some quality-of-life features are missing, such as the ease of recycling, repairing, or modifying existing units, and additional camera control options would have been welcomed.\r\nSince the demo only included one level of base-building and tower defense action, I couldn't delve deeply into the game's progression, advanced technologies, and units. However, based on my experience, I can confidently say that the gameplay loop is addicting enough on its own, and there is great potential if the developers can create a rewarding progression system that keeps the game fresh throughout the levels. Besides the campaign, the game is also set to include Skirmish and Creative game modes, which are much-needed additions for a game that possesses sandbox-like qualities.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5908742) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Bright Reappear, a match-three game combined with RPG-style gameplay, was released on June 21, 2023. It is now available on Taptap for $1.99. The question arises: is it worth the price? Is it a steal?\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique concept of blending match three and turn-based RPG\r\n- Satisfying match-three puzzle action\r\n- Nostalgic visuals and sound design\r\n- Light RPG mechanics## Cons\r\n-Minor UI gripes\r\nBright Reappear is an intriguing fusion of the popular Candy Crush match-three puzzle system and retro-style turn-based RPG gameplay. While these both addicting genres have rarely been combined in the past, this game brings its own unique twists to the table.\r\nThe graphics of Bright Reappear takes us back to the 80s and 90s era of PC gaming, showcasing a retro art style that evokes nostalgia and an adventurous atmosphere reminiscent of classic games from the past — now in mobile phone horizontal layout. The accompanying sound design perfectly complements the visuals, with low-fi atmospheric tracks that enhance the mood and immerse players in the experience.\r\nThe story is pretty simple. Bright Reappear is set in the continent of Oslo. The land, which has enjoyed centuries of peace, is suddenly consumed by darkness, posing a dire threat to its very existence. As players assume the role of the hero originating from the southern region, it becomes our duty to confront these menacing monsters and bring back light and hope to the entire continent.\r\nBright Reappear features six playable hero characters, with two heroes: “Warrior” and “Thieves”' already unlocked from the start. Each of them have their own distinct talents and skills that are affected by the match-three combat style system. I was able to play the demo version before, and this game is mostly the same with minor changes, only now with complete 12 chapters divided into levels and featuring up to 50 different enemies and bosses, the overall feel of the game feels incredibly satisfying as far as match-three gaming is concerned.\r\nWhen it comes to gameplay, Bright Reappear immerses players in a unique experience where they watch their hero go through side-scrolling levels and engage in thrilling one-on-one(one at  a time) battles with a variety of monsters. The combat mechanics adopt a traditional turn-based approach, but with a clever twist: instead of directly selecting actions, players must solve match-three puzzles to unleash a range of different actions with varying intensities. This unique gameplay mechanic is highly addicting, as with the nature of match-three puzzle gameplay style.\r\nThe core gameplay of Bright Reappear revolves around matching four icons: sword, book, potion, and gold. By strategically matching these icons in groups of three or more during battles, players trigger corresponding actions such as attacking, healing, earning gold coins, defending, or gaining additional moves. The mechanics of match-three games naturally lead to combos, and Bright Reappear is no exception. Whether intentionally planned or haphazardly made, combos unleash powerful combo attacks and impressive moves enacted by player character, resulting in flashy action-packed moments.\r\nBright Reappear introduces innovative twists to the match-three formula, offering players the freedom to move multiple pieces simultaneously,  depending if they have enough action points. These multi-piece moves, restricted to the same direction, provide a dynamic and fast-paced gameplay experience, setting it apart from traditional match-three games. Additionally, the strategic element is further enhanced by the freedom to move pieces without much repercussions aside from spreading negative effects on icons, even when no three-matches are immediately available, allow the player to the stage for bigger and more rewarding combinations. Despite an unlimited number of moves, players must carefully manage their characters' health points, as well as the spreading negative effects, while facing relentless enemy attacks, adding a layer of tactical decision-making to the gameplay.\r\nThe puzzles in Bright Reappear are not only about matching icons, but also feature various spreading negative effects that pose additional challenges. Spreading vines impede movement and require matching to eliminate, while weak stats on icons introduce negative effects that can only be resolved by careful puzzle-solving. These obstacles add some crucial depth to the turn-based combat, forcing players to think strategically and adapt their puzzle-solving approach to overcome these hurdles.\r\nIn addition to obstacles, powered-up icons bring an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay. By matching specific icons, players can activate powerful abilities in various forms, such as exploding all icons of the same type or triggering blasts with a specific square radius, vertically, horizontally, and more. These power-ups provide moments of satisfaction and allow players to unleash devastating attacks, turning the tide of battle in their favor.\r\nBright Reappear incorporates RPG mechanics, granting players the opportunity to acquire different weapons, armor, and accessories as they progress through the levels. The presence of gems adds further depth, as they can be used to enhance items and improve the hero's capabilities. Additionally, the gambling game mode offers a fun side activity, allowing players to test their luck and potentially amass additional gold coins.\r\nOne minor issue that persists from the demo to the full release is the user interface (UI), particularly the darkening of icons during moves. While the intention is to help players focus on the action above—an understandable concern, as the puzzles can be quite absorbing—it momentarily disrupts the strategic element and can lead to a sense of disorientation. The option to disable the darkening effect would have been a welcome addition, allowing players to customize their experience and maintain their strategic focus uninterrupted.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5904085) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Phantom Blade: Executioners\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nPre-register\r\nPhantom Blade: Executioners is a 2D side-scrolling martial arts hack and slash game available on PC, Android, and iOS, featuring full crossplay functionality. It is currently hosting a live open beta test from June 26 to July 10, 2023.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Four characters that players can all play, each with their own progression\r\n- Unique art style, a blend of Chinese Art and Anime.\r\n- Plethora of unlockable skills that can be mixed, matched, and synergized with each other\r\n- Clever approach to its combo chains combat system\r\n- Crossplay with PC, Android, and iOS## Cons\r\n-Minor performance problems\r\n-Floaty and unresponsive controls especially for the combat\r\n-Mixed voice acting quality\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\n## *No automated or idle mechanics\r\n## *These pros and cons are based on beta build and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product\r\nNot to be confused with the similarly titled AAA third-person hack and slash game Phantom Blade Zero, which unsurprisingly comes from the same developers, S-Game. Phantom Blade: Executioners takes a completely mobile-centric approach to the beloved Phantom Blade franchise.\r\nThe art style of the game is reminiscent of traditional Chinese drawings blended with anime-style graphics the game calls \"Kung fu punk\", resulting in a unique art style that visually stands out. Each playable character in the game is voice acted, adding depth to the story cutscenes and reflecting a change in voice-overs depending on the selected character.\r\nThe story is decent and involves love, vengeance, and centers around a corrupted power called Sha-Chi which turns everything into monsters. When it comes to the voice acting, I found it to be a mixed bag. While there is evidently extra effort put into the performances, many of them come across as cheesy, and unfortunately, the poorly written dialogues don't do much to improve the overall quality. But, that's not the main highlight of this game.\r\nMoving on to combat, Phantom Blade: Executioners offers a fast-paced  experience that requires players to utilize two-button abilities along with dodge/roll, jump, and parry/block actions. The game provides a plethora of unlockable abilities/skills that can be mixed, matched, and synergized to create amazing combos.\r\nThe developers have taken a very clever approach to combat combos, ensuring that it doesn't rely heavily on extreme memorization or finger bending combinations. Instead, players can pre-set up to two combo chains in their character's settings. By executing a preset combo chain, players only need to press the assigned ability button. However, this doesn't mean that the game doesn't require any reflexes at all. There are still plenty of opportunities for movement and agility through the dodge and parry maneuvers available. Although you can automate the combo flow once you press the button to kickstart the action, there are no fully automated or idle mechanics so the player will have to press every movement they want to make in this game.\r\nPhantom Blade: Executioners shares some similarities with souls-like games, featuring a high level of difficulty and a focus on reflexes and timed actions. Enemies will telegraph their attacks in a variety of ways, and it never felt unfair because of the visible warning indicators before their powerful attacks.\r\nHowever, I did notice that the controls in the game felt somewhat floaty and unresponsive. One reason for this is the noticeable delay due to the wind-up time required for most skills to activate. This delay can impact the responsiveness of the controls, making precise timing a bit challenging at times. I’ve also encountered minor performance issues with the game freezing or performing poorly at times.\r\nAdditionally, although the game is a side-scrolling hack and slash, players do have the ability to move \"up\" and \"down\" within the game environment. However, there isn't a proper animation for these movements, resulting in the characters appearing to skate upwards or downwards like retro titles. This aspect may feel mechanically outdated and could detract from the overall immersion and fluidity of the gameplay experience.\r\nThe game offers four unique characters: Soul, ZuoShang, Mu, and The Chord, representing the Swordsman, Heavy Swordsman, Agile Swordswoman, and Ranged Support Hero classes respectively. Players have the ability to create and play each character separately on a single account. These characters do not share resources or energy/stamina credits, except for the premium currency used in the shop. This allows players to switch between the characters and continue playing. It's important to note that when selecting a different character for the first time, the tutorials, story progression, and level advancement also start from scratch.\r\nIn addition to the main story, the game revolves around taking on missions to complete, transporting us into a 2.5D environment, a mini-open world divided into instances filled with enemies, events, side-quests, choices, and a boss fight at the end. There is also an asynchronous PvP system where you can enter a zone and you will get matched with an exact replica of another player's character which can give rewards if defeated.\r\nThe combined power of all characters contributes to the Organization level of the account, providing incremental base stat boosts known as Organization buffs for all characters. This, along with the separate energy credits, serves as an incentive for players to engage with and play each character in the game.\r\nGiven that the heroes are chosen in advance, the gacha system instead revolves around acquiring and attaching Phantoms to skills. Phantoms act as spirits or avatars that activate when the associated skill is used. Players have the flexibility to attach any Phantom to any skill, as long as they remain within the character's maximum perception limit – which increases as characters level. More powerful phantoms will cost more perceptions, so It’s not always about equipping the most powerful phantom if you want a more spread out Phantoms for all your skills.\r\nThe itemization is taken from a standard ARPG system, which will probably feel very familiar to Diablo fans. Characters can equip gear in different body slots, and players can find epic items with powerful bonuses and even set items that give huge bonuses when equipped together.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5913819) Originally posted on TapTap.",

In addition to animated emotes, the ability to freely control your hands, presumably to wave, adds an extra layer of immersion to the social interactions — taking a page out of VR games, allowing for non-verbal communication that enhances the overall experience. However, it's not quite solid yet, as there are countless animation bugs and control issues that can be a bit immersion-breaking and take away from the fun.\r\nAs you might have noticed already, ParaSpace shares similarities with platforms like VRChat, Roblox, or even sandbox games like Garry’s Mod, as it offers an avatar-based social experience and user-generated content.\r\nThe avatars and virtual worlds of ParaSpace are simply up to the imagination of the community, allowing for a truly immersive experience. I’m not quite sure how licenses are handled here, but ParaSpace has extensive customization options and encourages creating content for the platform, even characters and levels from other franchises. I could personalize my avatar to reflect my unique style, experimenting with different outfits, accessories, and appearances. The level of freedom and creativity in avatar customization is amazing, ensuring that every user can choose or even customly create a representation that feels authentic to their personalities.\r\nParaSpace also allows abled players to — from scratch — create and share their own avatars and worlds, contributing to the ever-growing library of content available to the community. This fosters a sense of collaboration, as users can integrate others' creations into their own worlds, expanding the possibilities and fostering a vibrant ecosystem of creativity.  Although, not everyone will be able to dive into this content creation element, as it currently requires experience in Graphics software, 3D modeling, and in some cases, programming.\r\nWith the ever-growing library of content, the platform promises to offer thousands or even millions of user-created worlds, ranging from breathtaking landscapes to intricate game setups. The instances are divided in two categories, worlds and rooms. Worlds are basically the levels, in which some of them have custom programming built in to support the function of their world, such as a mini-game, or an event. Rooms are basically the servers in the game, where you can choose a World to host a room in, and invite other players to join.\r\nThe ability to teleport and seamlessly join other users' rooms, as well as create temporary portals for other rooms and worlds is a nice bonus, allowing for effortless navigation and discovery. Most of the main premade game modes revolve around party rooms, chat lounges, watching movies, enjoying a great scenery, or playing games like murder mystery or party games, However the possibilities are endless.\r\nAs said earlier, ParaSpace goes beyond social interactions and exploration by offering a variety of entertaining mini-games and activities. From murder mystery puzzles to party games, these experiences provide enjoyable challenges and opportunities for friendly competition. Some mini-games have intricate mechanics, although they are entirely up to how the creator will program them. The diverse range of options ensures that there is something for everyone, catering to different tastes and preferences.\r\nIn addition to the bustling social events and thrilling mini-games, ParaSpace also provides chill and relaxation spaces. I particularly enjoyed the ability to gather virtually and watch movies or videos together, creating a cozy virtual theater experience. The serene and picturesque landscapes of various worlds can also provide a peaceful retreat, as long as you don’t have anyone joining your room and playing a loud sound to disturb you.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5914881) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Set to launch on August 10, 2023, Overwatch 2: Invasion will transport players back into the heart of the action-packed narrative of Overwatch 2, immersing them in thrilling PvE story missions against the formidable forces of Null Sector.\r\nThe update will introduce three exhilarating missions set in iconic global locations. Heroes will be pitted against the relentless onslaught of Null Sector in the sprawling streets of Rio de Janeiro, the bustling metropolis of Toronto, and the enchanting city of Gothenburg. Each mission promises huge maps, intricate objectives, and an immersive storyline that will keep players on the edge of their seats. I'm personally excited for this as the lore for Overwatch is actually interested in itself, especially if you have watched the animated shorts for Overwatch before.\r\nAside from the story missions, there's a new bonus co-op event on King's Row, as well as a new PVP core game mode called Flashpoint, in which teams will engage in frantic battles to secure control over strategic locations known as \"flashpoints,\" with the objective of capturing at least three of them. Not only that, but the update also features changes to the training and practice game modes, even going as far as offering leaderboards to those looking to master its training courses.\r\nIn conjunction with the Story Missions update, Blizzard is offering the Overwatch 2: Invasion Bundle, allowing players to dive headfirst into the gripping narrative and PvE action for $15 USD. This bundle includes access to the Story Missions during the season and permanently thereafter, along with 1,000 Overwatch Coins, a new Legendary skin for Sojourn, and permanent access to Sojourn as a playable hero upon completing Story Mission challenges. 1,000 Overwatch coins is valued at around $10 in itself, so basically you’d be getting the rest of the content for just $5.\r\nFor those seeking an even more comprehensive experience, the Overwatch 2: Ultimate Invasion Bundle is available for $40 USD. This bundle includes all the content of the Invasion Bundle, as well as additional bonuses like the Null Sector Premium Battle Pass with 20 Battle Pass skips, an extra 1,000 Overwatch Coins, and two legendary skins for Cassidy and Kiriko.\r\nOverwatch 2: Invasion is set to launch on August 10, 2023. However, not everyone is pleased with the recent announcement. Just a few weeks ago, it was revealed that the original PvE vision for Overwatch 2, which planned to include proper hero progression, talent trees, and high replayability, has been effectively canceled. Instead, Overwatch 2: Invasion will introduce a more straightforward story missions co-op mode for an additional price tag.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5914956) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "VALORANT Mobile\r\n9.1\r\nMultiplayer\r\nFast-paced\r\nPre-register\r\nValorant’s patch 7.0 has finally gone online and it introduces the highly requested Team Deathmatch mode along with a new Agent Deadlock , and three exclusive maps made specifically for the new game mode: Piazza, District, and Kasbah. In terms of aesthetics, Piazza bears a resemblance to Ascent with its European architecture, District resembles Split with its urban Japanese setting, and Kasbah shares similarities with Bind with its African location.\r\nValorant's new Team Deathmatch mode is an exciting addition that offers players a fast-paced and action-packed experience. Unlike the standard free-for-all Deathmatch where players compete to reach 40 kills or achieve the most kills within a 9-minute timeframe, Team Deathmatch divides players into two teams, each consisting of five players, competing against each other in a race to reach 100 kills or have the highest kill count within a match duration of 9 minutes and 30 seconds.\r\nThe release of the new Sentinel Agent, Deadlock, brings fresh gameplay options. Deadlock is equipped with nanowires that help secure the battlefield. The abilities of Deadlock include Sonic Sensors, which detect footsteps and sounds, concussing enemies upon detection. The Barrier Mesh ability deploys a shield that blocks movement but not bullets, allowing for strategic positioning. The Gravnet ability is a grenade that forces enemies caught in its area of effect to crouch and move slowly.\r\nDeadlock's ultimate ability, Annihilation, functions similarly to Sova's ultimate. It unleashes a beam of nanowires that captures the first enemy caught and slowly pulls them along a path, eventually causing them to die unless they are rescued by their teammates.\r\nThe mode features four stages within the match, with each stage having its own loadout and upgraded lethality. At the beginning of each stage, players have the opportunity to choose their loadout in the Spawn Room or anytime they respawn. This allows players to tailor their weapon selection according to their playstyle and preferences. It's worth noting that there is no in-game economy in Team Deathmatch, so players are not required to manage their economy or purchase weapons during the match.\r\nTo enhance the gameplay experience, Weapon Spawners are strategically placed throughout the map in fixed locations. These Spawners offer different weapons (especially shotguns and snipers which are not available in the stages) that players can acquire. It's important for teams to quickly reach and secure these weapons to gain an advantage over the opposing team. The weapons available from the Spawners may vary from match to match, and they improve as the match progresses through the stages.\r\nAdditionally, there are Recovery and Ultimate Orbs scattered around the map. When players collect a Recovery Orb, it grants a buff that gradually restores their Health and Shield over a duration of 6 seconds. These Recovery Orbs are available in specific sections of each map, and both teams will compete to claim them. Ultimate Orbs, on the other hand, contribute to charging up players' Ultimate abilities. Collecting Ultimate Orbs increases the players' Ultimate percentage, bringing them closer to activating their powerful ultimates.\r\nIn terms of gameplay mechanics, abilities in Team Deathmatch will recharge over time after being used. However, different abilities have varying recharge times, so players must strategically manage their ability usage. Upon death, players respawn in their team's Spawn Room, which provides a brief period of invulnerability for 15 seconds. After this initial protection, players will begin taking damage if they remain in the Spawn Room, encouraging them to swiftly return to the battlefield.\r\nThe match concludes when a team reaches 100 kills or has the highest kill count at the end of the 9 minutes and 30 seconds duration. If a match ends before either team reaches 100 kills, the team with the highest kill count emerges as the victor. In the event of a tied score at the end of the match, it results in a draw.\r\nThe new Team Deathmatch mode offers a dynamic and thrilling experience, catering to both casual players and competitive enthusiasts. With its fast-paced gameplay, stage-based loadouts, weapon spawners, orbs, and intense gunplay, it provides a refreshing alternative to the traditional modes in Valorant.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5921449) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Upon dropping in with a thrilling rocket riding jump sequence, players will have to scavenge for weapons, armor, and supplies. The current only map available, Galuga Islands, already provides ample space for exploration, driving, and intense encounters with other players. Currently, the game only allows you to play in squads of 4, with on option of playing in solo or duo, but that’s probably going to change as the game develops.\r\nA nod to the Contra series' roots, the game features the classic double jump summersault mechanic, allowing players to more easily reach higher elevation, compared to other battle royale games.\r\nWhile the game deviates from the fast-paced, arcade shooter style of its predecessors, the third person movement feels smooth, and the gunplay is solid, ensuring an engaging experience for battle royale enthusiasts. As far as the gameplay formula goes, it is all Contra but name only.  Despite being a test build, the game is surprisingly optimized, and the map design is visually appealing.\r\nThe game offers a wide array of weapons, ranging from fictional firearms with real-life resemblances to futuristic laser weapons which are more rare. Players can loot these weapons from the game world or find them in supply drops.  Players can also loot backpacks, armor, and helmets scattered throughout the map. However, it's worth noting that these items do not reflect in the characters' visual appearance. This design choice is primarily influenced by the game's focus on cosmetic customization, which takes precedence over altering the character's visual representation based on gameplay items.\r\nAs a live service game, Contra: Tournament incorporates familiar features such as login bonuses, weekly events, and in-game cosmetics available for purchase. However, it is important to acknowledge that the game currently implements a pay-to-win scheme. This scheme involves certain weapon cosmetics sold in the store providing performance advantages, such as improved aim speed, stability, recoil, accuracy, magazine capacity, and other aspects. It is crucial to consider how this implementation may impact the balance and fairness of gameplay.\r\nGaluga Islands, the current sole map in Contra: Tournament, impresses with its size and clean visual fidelity, no unnecessary elements are present, resulting in a good performance and clear line of sight for a competitive battleground. It also features Regular Battle Royale and Boss Challenge, although they are not really much different from each other, one just adds boss challenges on top of a Battle Royale showdown.\r\nWhile the game has decent sounds for the guns, there are occasional issues with footsteps and positional audio. As a result the sound experience is somewhat of a mixed bag for me. On numerous occasions, there are instances where I keep hearing some footsteps coming from behind me, only to realize 99% of the time it's just my own footsteps, it's just better to rely on the mini-map footstep markers to know the general enemy position.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5928079) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Recently launched worldwide, Harry Potter: Magic Awakened is a free-to-play mobile game that offers fans an immersive mobile experience in the Wizarding World like never before, featuring a captivating story and a journey filled with magic, friendship, and intrigue.\r\nHarry Potter: Magic Awakened features a brand new story that takes place shortly after the events of the original series, providing a rare but key glimpse into the aftermath of Harry Potter’s main story. As a newly accepted student, you'll unravel an intriguing narrative that builds upon the foundations laid by the Harry Potter books. The story beautifully blends familiar elements with new and engaging plotlines, ensuring that both die-hard fans and newcomers will be equally engaged.\r\nHarry Potter: Magic Awakened also allows players to relive memorable moments from the original series, even going as far as having a bonus story mode dedicated to it. These flashbacks are narrated by various characters, adding depth and nostalgia to the overall storyline that existing fans will surely appreciate. The game's impressive use of fully animated and voice-acted cutscenes enhances the immersive narrative, offering a level of storytelling rarely seen in mobile games and is much closer to PC and console games.\r\nbonus story mode dedicated to it.\r\nHarry Potter: Magic Awakened weaves a compelling narrative that — unsurprisingly — revolves around the lives of a group of young witches and wizards, including the player-created main character, highly mirroring the premise of the original series but still managing to give a fresh experience.\r\nAs opposed to its AAA counterpart Hogwarts Legacy, the story of Magic Awakened is a much more grounded one, with the character not really being a chosen one or gifted type of character and just a regular student in Hogwarts.  The stakes are not overly high, and many of the quests focus on slice-of-life stories that immerse players in the daily life of a Hogwarts student. Year 1 up to Year 2 is entirely playable, Year 3 and 4 content yet to be released.\r\nAs the player-created main character, you join a diverse group of aspiring witches and wizards, including the headstrong and entitled Cassandra, the feisty Frey twins who prefer dueling to forming friendships, the mysterious but friendly Ivy Warrington, the daring Quidditch enthusiast Robyn, the intellectually curious Kevin, the introverted potion-making expert Daniel, and the artistic and observant Lottie. Each supporting character brings their unique personality, dreams, and challenges to the table, creating a dynamic group that grows and evolves together.\r\nThe developers have struck a fine balance between a traditional mobile game and a proper narrative-driven game. While the story takes center stage, players have the option to fast forward or skip cutscenes if they prefer to focus solely on the deck-building and combat gameplay.\r\nThe world-building in Harry Potter: Magic Awakened is nothing short of magical. From the bustling streets of Diagon Alley to the hallowed halls of Hogwarts, the game faithfully recreates the iconic locations we've come to love. While the stylized graphics may not rival those of higher-budget titles, the game captures the essence and atmosphere of the Harry Potter universe, transporting players to a world filled with wonder and adventure.\r\nCheck here for the Full Review of the gameplay.\r\nCheck here for the Full Review of the gameplay.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5924851) Originally posted on TapTap.",

You take on the role of a Spirit among the 4 elements: Nature, Earth, Water and Fire, and engage in other fallen souls to reclaim their place in the world tree.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Charming art style\r\n- Intriguing game concept\r\n- Cooperative mode## Cons\r\n-Extremely slow pacing that takes away the enjoyment\r\n-Lack of communication or social features for teamwork opportunities\r\n-Luck being a significant factor in winning, alongside pure skill.\r\n-Shallow gameplay mechanics\r\n-Imbalanced character abilities and traits\r\nSpiritle features a story premise that revolves around spirits and the 4 elements: Nature, Earth, Water and Fire, and shines in its art style, featuring a charming and cartoonish paint-like aesthetic. The characters and overall visual design are appealing, however, beyond the introduction story, the lore is practically non-existent, as it is actually a competitive Match-2 game with a focus on PvP battles. The game is free to play, with only cosmetics as in-app purchases.\r\nGameplay wise, it is a match-two game where you need to unravel the tiles nature (its biome, e.g. volcano, swamplands, grasslands, etc) and match the same tiles to be able to attack. The premise of moving around the tiles and finding a matching biome is a bit weird at first, especially after the cute story intro they set up for the game, but it gets better as you play.\r\nAll the tiles are initially hidden, and players must gradually uncover them with two moves each turn. Selecting and moving to a tile reveals its nature to all players, but it becomes hidden again once their turn ends, making memorization important. There is a temporary short log to view the history of these selections, aiding players to some extent, although entries disappear as more are added.\r\nSuccessful attacks give players two more moves, which allows them to chain two attacks together as long as they can match more tiles. If the tiles run out and the matches are still ongoing, they just reset with a new and bigger layout. The match continues until there is one player or team left standing.\r\nApart from the match-two gameplay, the game also features bonus abilities for each character and an in-game shop that at the cost of a move, allows players to purchase additional abilities by collecting gold randomly scattered on the tiles. Each character has their own ability set, as well as one choice of item to equip and bring into matches. Although I did find that the characters aren’t really well balanced, and it's just a matter of racing to pick the best one once the match starts.\r\nThe 4-player match features two main game modes: classic mode which is a 1v1v1v1 matchup and a cooperative 2v2 game mode. As far as the concept goes, the rule set of the game is actually a very intriguing concept and one that has compelled me to play more. However, how it is executed in the game’s format leaves much to be desired. The most glaring issue is that the game is unbearably slow-paced, everything takes too long and is riddled with long unnecessary pauses. In addition, there is too much time given to the players to make a move, and even if they do move as soon as they can, the pauses are still extremely jarring and takes the enjoyment out of the game. Also, the 4 player match doesn’t help as well, as you’d have to wait for three other players to make a move. Only the co-op mode’s solo feature, which allows you to control two characters at once, makes this game more bearable to a small extent.\r\nFurthermore, unless this is the intentional design of the developer, there is no way to communicate or chat with other players. As a result, proper teamwork and combos are completely out of the equation, adding more guesswork to the already wildcard matches. The matches themselves aren’t really deep, and getting attack moves only boils down to who is better at prediction and memorizing the tiles to be able to match them. The board itself isn’t that big to make a meaningful difference, and matches almost always go into many resets and rounds (because all the tiles are exhausted) before someone is eliminated.\r\nThe 1v1v1v1 matchup is flawed in a way that attacking doesn't really contribute to a concrete step towards winning unless there are only two players left. Due to its free-for-all nature, everyone can attack anyone, and it purely relies on luck on who the players will gang up on. Ultimately, winning comes down to being one of the two remaining lucky players with decent HP and then now using your memory, and again a bit of luck, to defeat your opponent. As a result, 2v2 looks like a much superior game mode.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/5929299) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Just a typical soccer video game like FIFA with a touch of anime action, arcadeyness, and simplicity to it.\r\nThe core gameplay in CAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE revolves around controlling the entire team during matches. It successfully captures the essence of the series' intense soccer battles, providing an exciting experience that puts players in the shoes of the soccer players in the Anime. The arcade-style mechanics make it easy for players to jump into the action, while the simplicity allows for quick and intuitive gameplay. Executing precise passes, powerful shots, and skillful dribbles feels satisfying, giving players a sense of control over the outcome of the matches.\r\nAs far as the presentation goes, the game is amazingly action-packed, with highly detailed, over-the-top anime action for scoring goals, defending goals, and sometimes even showcasing tackles and dashes when abilities are used. The visual spectacle may become repetitive over time, but the premise of competing and the satisfaction from defeating the opposition or narrowly overcoming challenging teams is what will keep you engaged and playing.\r\nCAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE is a mobile gacha soccer team based on the manga and anime series of the same name. It is currently conducting an Android Closed Beta Testing from July 3-17 in select regions.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5958761?share_id=cd7818fc1791&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Each attack and ability is accompanied by visually stunning effects that heighten the excitement and intensity of the gameplay. The game is presented like an Action RPG with all its cool animations, without actually being one.\r\nUnlike many contemporary RPGs, King Arthur: Legends Rise breaks away from linear level-based missions and offers players the freedom to roam the levels at their own pace, although it is but an illusion of choice because there’s really not much to do aside from going to the next destination. Additionally, the proportions of the characters in relation to the environment can be a bit off, with the players appearing larger than the surroundings, reminiscent of early 2000s strategy and RPG games.The auto-walk option provides convenience for those looking to just skip the exploration aspect and jump straight to the objective.

As players progress through the game, they have the opportunity to rebuild and manage Camelot, the iconic city associated with King Arthur. Upgrading buildings, managing resources become crucial for the development of Camelot and its role in the narrative.\r\nWhile King Arthur: Legends Rise showcases incredible AAA visuals and captivating gameplay, it is worth mentioning that the performance on the Android version, during the open beta, could benefit from further improvement. I’ve also encountered lip-syncing problems with the characters in their dialogue that took me out of the immersion multiple times. Furthermore, the UI is in a bit of a rough state and is an eyesore to my taste.. However, it's important to note that this is an Open Beta Test and that the developers are actively seeking feedback and working to address these issues before the game's official launch.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5960817?share_id=f91c75478306&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It was released last 2017 to overwhelmingly positive reviews with sadly only one DLC being released a year after.\r\nIn the game, players take control of a nameless knight armed with a versatile weapon known as the nail. The combat mechanics are fluid and satisfying, allowing players to engage in intense 2D battles against a wide variety of enemies and towering bosses. Aside from jumping, slashing, and dashing, the player can also unlock and perform a variety of abilities and moves as they progress through the game.

Pale Court also introduces a fresh musical score that seamlessly integrates with Hollow Knight's original soundtrack, as well as the new artwork with direction faithful to the original game. The new enemy designs and boss sprites blend seamlessly into the existing world of Hallownest. It’s almost as if this mod is actually part of the game, you literally cannot tell from the looks alone.\r\nPale Court's difficulty level (the added boss fights) matches or even surpasses that of the base game. The modders have expertly crafted encounters that once again, push players to their limits, demanding precise timing, quick reflexes, and strategic thinking. Each boss fight presents a unique and engaging challenge, testing the player's abilities and forcing them to adapt their approach. Even in the first boss, It took me countless times before I was able to conquer it. It was never too unfair or too unreasonable, you just need to master its attacks and timing to be able to beat it. The resulting satisfaction from beating these bosses is just as satisfying as the bosses from the base game.\r\nWith Hollow Knight: Silksong, the highly anticipated sequel still on the horizon, Pale Court arrives as a timely gift for fans eagerly awaiting its release, that is if you are playing on PC. But who knows? With the help of the developers, we might be seeing an official release to consoles as well one of these days.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5957287?share_id=10836a2cdf0d&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

MLB 9 Innings Rivals features significantly improved graphics, new mechanics, and fresh ideas to enhance the addicting player collecting and fantasy baseball gameplay.\r\nGameplay wise, the actual baseball sports gameplay is very well done. While still somewhat resembling console's MLB The Show game mechanics and UI elements, The whole process is simplified and you’re not really directly controlling every single thing going on, and mostly focused on playing as a batter or a pitcher. You can approach matches in three ways: Quick Play, which simulates the whole match instantly but requires quick play tickets; Highlight play, which takes you into the game but simulates most of it, only bringing the player in control of being a batter/pitcher a handful of times; Lastly, you can completely play the entirety of the matches in Full Play, which takes a very long time to do, even if you skip most of the presentation scenes.\r\nOutside of the actual sport lies the fantasy baseball aspect of the game, which involves gacha and player collecting mechanics, as well as deck-building elements. As a live-service gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, season passes, materials to upgrade player decks, premium currency, and an energy system called \"balls\" to continue playing—nothing out of the ordinary. You can also engage in PvP mode, where you are matched with players of similar deck strength. As a free-to-play experience, I find the game highly enjoyable, especially if you have a genuine appreciation for baseball and are just looking to have some decent, high-quality baseball fun on the go.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5969489?share_id=349ce48f4e67&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Release date is still unknown, but according to the iOS app store page, the placeholder expected release date is December 2, 2023, however take this information with a grain of salt.\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat is kind of in a no man’s land when it comes to the narrative, similar to “DMC”, it is instead set in its own continuity, but treads a familiar ground for fans by being a retelling of DMC 3 plus other elements taken from all over the mainline games, even those set after DMC 3. The game features three mainline characters that were also featured in DMC 3; Dante, Vergil, and Lady, now teaming up with each other with seamless character switching and integrated combos during combat.\r\nThe visuals are nothing amazing by today's standards, but it definitely looks better than DMC 3 and lands in the same ballpark as DMC 4, which is decent for mobile game standards. The atmosphere and feel of the series is mostly retained, including the soundtrack and effects. The character models are succinctly detailed, and the environments are well-designed, successfully capturing the atmospheric essence of the series. While playing on a smaller screen, the visuals are able to maintain an enhanced level of fidelity.\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat features full voice acting for many of the pre-rendered cutscenes, with different voice actors for our iconic characters such as Dante. The performances are mostly done right, and I have no complaints whatsoever. However, many of the in-game cutscenes are silent and lack dialogue, despite the game seeming like it will include it based on how the dialogues are presented.\r\nThe core gameplay mechanics of Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat stay true to the franchise's roots, offering fast-paced, combo-driven combat. Players are treated to the familiar hack-and-slash style the series is known for, engaging in thrilling battles against hordes of demonic foes. At the same time, it adds its own twist via a popular mobile game mechanic, which is the seamless characters switching. Players are allowed to seamlessly switch between Dante, Vergil, and Lady to perform synergistic combos on top of their own movesets. Recently, a fourth playable character — Nero  has been added as an option.\r\nThe controls are responsive, enabling precise movement, powerful attacks, and stylish combos. You can dash, launch into the air, perform quick or powerful attacks, as well as one ability and ultimate ability. While the attack system is simplified for mobile — including Dante’s moveset which now incorporates both sword fighting and gunslinging into one moveset. it retains enough variety to create enjoyable and visually impressive combos, especially when the seamless character switching feature is used to combine characters.\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat has all the hallmarks of what makes DMC great, but in mobile form: The combat system, the beloved characters, and a linear story mode campaign. Infused with its gameplay is a live service element and gacha system that is incorporated into the progression system.\r\nIn order to progress through the campaign, you need to level up your overall rank, which means gathering EXPs from completing open-ended missions, which will also give materials to upgrade weapons, characters, and stats. You can also try rolling for new character cosmetics, weapon skins, and more powerful rare legendary movesets via the gacha system, either by spending money or religiously playing the game.\r\nThe inclusion of a gacha system, while a popular mechanic in mobile games, may polarize fans especially those coming from the mainline series. While it adds a layer of excitement and collectibility, the game's reliance on grinding and the need to spend real money to unlock desired items can be a turnoff for some players.\r\nIn an ironic twist of events, on the mobile platform known for its idle game mechanics, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat doesn't have an Automatic Mode that was featured in the mainline series to make it accessible for more people. It's a shame because the gacha and farming-oriented progression system would have benefitted from idle mechanics.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5966260?share_id=cbd912929c7c&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "MLB Rivals\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nMLB 9 Innings Rivals is a brand new mobile game for baseball fans, featuring console level visuals, simple gameplay, fantasy baseball management, and player collecting mechanics.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Accessible and simplified gameplay\r\n- Impressive console level graphics\r\n- Realistic player animation and movements\r\n- Playable in both portrait and landscape## Cons\r\n-landscape game mode only available for matches, not menus\r\nMLB 9 Innings Rivals is a modern follow-up to MLB 9 Innings (currently MLB 9 Innings 23), a game that was originally released way back in 2016. MLB 9 Innings Rivals features significantly improved graphics, new mechanics, and fresh ideas to enhance the addicting player collecting and fantasy baseball gameplay.\r\nAs a casual fan with limited knowledge of baseball, I approached MLB 9 Innings Rivals with a sense of curiosity, and boy, I was pleasantly surprised by how fun and easy to understand the game is. Right from the start, you immediately notice the amazing graphics this game has, especially in close-ups and replays when you try the manual play mode. Compared to console games like MLB The Show, this is as close as it gets for mobile devices. It doesn’t dive deeply into the mechanics of baseball, and just assumes the player knows a bit about it. Players completely going in without knowledge of baseball should do a little bit of research beforehand.\r\nThe highly detailed graphics perfectly capture the essence of the sport. The player models and stadiums are well-designed and made more immersive by the impressive motion-captured animations for all player movements. The animations are very realistic, dynamic, and make you feel like you're actually watching a real game.\r\nRoster and team wise, MLB 9 Innings Rivals includes all 30 Major League Baseball teams and the season schedule of 2023. This allows players to step into the shoes of any of their favorite teams and experience the thrill of a full season.\r\nGameplay wise, the actual baseball sports gameplay is very well done. While still somewhat resembling MLB The Show’s game mechanics and UI elements, The whole process is simplified and you’re not really directly controlling every single thing going on, and mostly focused on playing as a batter or a pitcher.\r\nYou can approach matches in three ways: Quick Play, which simulates the whole match instantly but requires quick play tickets; Highlight play, which takes you into the game but simulates most of it, only bringing the player in control of being a batter/pitcher a handful of times; Lastly, you can completely play the entirety of the matches in Full Play, which takes a very long time to do, even if you skip most of the presentation scenes.\r\nPlaying as a pitcher, you need to select the desired throw type depending on the player, as well as the desired area to throw it in. Playing as a batter—which is definitely the better experience for me—you just need to predict which part of the catch area it will land on and touch the screen at the right timing to successfully hit the ball. The whole process is simplified but very satisfying to perform, especially when trying to hit balls and aiming for a home run.\r\nOutside of the actual sport lies the fantasy baseball aspect of the game, which involves gacha and player collecting mechanics, as well as deck-building elements. As a live-service gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, season passes, materials to upgrade player decks, premium currency, and an energy system called \"balls\" to continue playing—nothing out of the ordinary. You can also engage in PvP mode, where you are matched with players of similar deck strength. As a free-to-play experience, I find the game highly enjoyable, especially if you have a genuine appreciation for baseball and are just looking to have some decent, high-quality baseball fun on the go.\r\nThe game offers flexibility in gameplay modes, allowing you to play in either landscape or portrait mode during matches. This accessibility option is a significant advantage for players who have a preference for a particular orientation. However, it's worth noting that the menus, particularly when managing teams and players, are limited to portrait mode, which can be inconvenient for landscape-oriented players. Having to switch back and forth between orientations during play sessions can disrupt the overall experience.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5969511?share_id=2af7c0f0f5b9&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Additionally, players must construct a deck lineup of champions to bring into battles.\r\nThe fundamental gameplay revolves around a straightforward auto chess mechanic: each round, players are granted 10 gold, and they can use this currency to purchase and deploy from a selection of three random champions or abilities. Following auto chess conventions, strategic placement of units becomes crucial, as it determines the outcome of battles. Proper resource management and clever utilization are also vital aspects of the game.\r\nDuring my first few minutes of Mojo Melee, while the game is indeed engaging enough, I've encountered a lot of technical challenges that hampered my gameplay experience. The initial loading takes too long (five minutes) so don't worry if you are experiencing that, just wait it out. Once the game loaded up however, the subsequent loadings were much faster.  Also, matchmaking for me is currently unplayable due to the lack of players, so don't expect a lot of multiplayer action for now. Thankfully, I was able to get most of my enjoyable battling AI with the practice mode.\r\nOriginally made as a browser game, Mojo Melee also plans to launch another beta test in August for iOS devices, ensuring that people have access to it regardless of whether they're using browsers or phones.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5979513?share_id=2fa0fdede910&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It plans to launch another beta test in August for iOS devices, ensuring that people have access to it regardless of whether they're using browsers or phones.\r\nThe game presents a charming and unique alien/nature-esque visual style, featuring chess figurine-looking character designs and colorful but dark tones. There is an intriguing contradiction within the graphics. While the characters themselves exude a joyful and cheerful atmosphere, the overall palette tends to lean towards darker tones.\r\nPlayers choose a leader character known as a Mojo, each possessing a unique set of skills based on the chosen Mojo. Some are focused on defensive buffs, some are healers, and some focus on inflicting damage. Additionally, players must construct a deck lineup of champions to bring into battles.\r\nThe fundamental gameplay revolves around a straightforward mechanic: each round, players are granted 10 gold, and they can use this currency to purchase and deploy from a selection of three random champions or abilities. Following auto chess conventions, strategic placement of units becomes crucial, as it determines the outcome of battles. Proper resource management and clever utilization are also vital aspects of the game.\r\nMojo Melee features two distinct modes: Duel and Brawl. In Duel mode, two Mojos engage in a series of rounds, with the first player to win three rounds emerging as the victor. On the other hand, in Brawl mode, players face off against multiple opponents in a two-stage competition. The top two players from each group advance to the semifinals, and the winners of the subsequent matches progress to the finals.\r\nDifferent units will possess distinct attack types, health levels, abilities, and AI. The combat in Mojo Melee is undeniably engaging and offers an intriguing tactical experience. The battles are highly strategic, and even when facing a 0-2 deficit, comebacks are always possible thanks to the dynamic nature of the battle rounds. Aside from units, there are two types of spells, one is a buff spell that is applied to champions, the other is a cast spell such as ‘Meteorites’ that is placed on a tile and activated upon the start of the round.\r\nCurrently, Mojo Melee offers in-game purchases that enable players to acquire Mojo, champion, or ability packs to further bolster their lineups. Additionally, players can obtain in-game currencies and resources to upgrade their champions, as well as seasonal battlepacks. It's important to note that these purchases are considered as contributions towards the ongoing development of the game. Even after progression resets, especially during the worldwide official launch, these purchases will persist.\r\nWhile the game is indeed engaging, many of the other problems I’ve encountered come from the technical side of things. Firstly, the initial loading time for the tutorial was unacceptably long, taking approximately five minutes. It felt as if the game was completely unresponsive or frozen. Once the game loaded up however, the subsequent loadings were much faster.\r\nAlso, the game also suffers from lack of players and I could not for the life of me find anyone to play against. So I settled with playing against the AI, which was a formidable opponent for beginners anyway and allowed me to learn the basics of the game. I’ve also encountered some visual bugs and generally clunkiness like units teleporting around or the absence of visual effects that made the combat somewhat unappealing sometimes. I also disliked how there is no account linking to any of the big social platforms (TapTap, Google, Facebook, etc) in place for easy registration. Everyone will have to input their username, email, and password manually.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5979514?share_id=38b82e6f0000&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Persona 5: The Phantom X\r\nAction\r\nRPG\r\nPersona 5: The Phantom X\r\nAction\r\nRPG\r\nLooks like the Persona franchise is expanding at an unprecedented rate. In addition to the recently announced Persona 5 Tactica and Persona 3 Reload (a complete remake of Persona 3), we are also being treated to an official mobile spin-off titled Persona 5: The Phantom X. Interestingly, this spin-off appears to be much more than just a spin-off, resembling a fully-fledged game in its own right.\r\nFor the uninitiated, Persona 5: The Phantom X is an RPG that combines turn-based combat, slice of life elements, and an anime-inspired art style. Serving as a mobile + PC spin-off of the popular Persona 5 game and Persona series as a whole, it brings players back to Japan and reintroduces them to the Phantom Thieves, now led by a fresh protagonist and featuring a new cast of characters. Notably, this installment is specifically designed for the mobile platform, marking a first for the series.\r\nShown above, the new trailer shown at the TapTap Game Conference 2023 showcases more of the game, including FMV anime scenes made specifically for the game, as well as the cel-shaded art style from Persona 5 and the upbeat music and jazz rock elements of the series. It also highlights the main protagonist, codenamed \"Wonder\".\r\nOf course, it wouldn’t be Persona without its trademark slice-of-life elements. Including going to school, going to the gym, roaming around the city, eating out, playing video games, and doing just about anything you would expect a high-schooler would do.\r\nAlso seen in the trailer, The turn-based combat features a traditional JRPG system that seems to have been directly borrowed from Persona 5, showcasing similar UI elements, mechanics, and an overall visual presentation.\r\nAs a Persona fan, I'm very excited about this game. However, I'm a bit reserved when it comes to the \"mobile-ization\" of the game. The inclusion of a gacha system, while a popular mechanic in mobile games, may polarize fans of the Persona series who are more accustomed to the traditional upfront payment model. However, this has the upside of making the game free-to-play, which makes the Persona franchise accessible to a lot of people, especially since it is set to launch on both mobile and PC.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5979771?share_id=9d19aed4fcda&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With a captivating combination of hero collection and a unique bidding system, this title offers an addictive and strategic experience.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique bidding mechanics\r\n- Strategic tower defense gameplay\r\n- Asynchronous tower defense PvP mechanics## Cons\r\n-In-App purchases can change the balance of PvP\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nThese pros and cons are based on the soft launch version of Defense Derby available on Android.Some aspects of the game may have been updated or changed since the time of writing.\r\nDefense Derby revolves around defending your square castle from waves of relentless monsters. Strategic placement of heroes atop the castle is crucial for survival. The game offers a diverse range of units inspired by the fantasy genre, including mages, archers, swordsmen, riflemen, and wizards. Each unit possesses unique attributes, attack ranges, and attack types, allowing players to develop diverse tactical approaches.\r\nDefense Derby boasts an eye-catching visual style that blends vibrant cartoons with anime-inspired artwork. The in-game graphics feature a whimsical and stylized 3D design, immersing players in a visually appealing world. The characters are intricately detailed and possess a charming aesthetic reminiscent of popular mobile games like Clash Royale and beloved RPG classics like World of Warcraft. The visual presentation enhances the overall experience, complementing the addictive gameplay.\r\nDefense Derby features a fun multiplayer mode, known as \"Derby.\" In this mode, four players compete individually, in their own castles, to survive waves of enemies. The last castle standing emerges as the victorious player. Aside from watching your own castle defense, you can also spectate your opponents castles and see how they fare. What sets Derby apart is the innovative bidding system. Prior to each round, players construct their deck of cards by bidding on available options. Initially, players start with two cards, and subsequent bidding rounds determine additional cards and limit opponents' choices.\r\nThe bidding process is the backbone of the PvP gameplay in Defense Derby. It introduces a strategic layer where players must balance their resources and determine the optimal bid for each card. Winning bids secure desired cards, depleting opponents' options and resources. However, overbidding can result in resource scarcity for subsequent rounds, while underbidding risks losing access to vital units. The bidding system results in a compelling blend of resource management, psychological tactics, and calculated decision-making.\r\nIn addition to bidding, defeating boss monsters rewards players with extra cards, further incentivizing strategic gameplay. Synergy between units plays a crucial role, as combining similar units and positioning them strategically can significantly impact the outcome of battles. Players also have the ability to reposition units with a cooldown, allowing them to efficiently cover all sides of the castle depending on enemy position, using minimal resources.\r\nAnother primary gameplay mode in Defense Derby is the singleplayer \"Blitz\" mode, where players must overcome progressively challenging stages using a preselected lineup of units and heroes, this functions more like a traditional tower defense game, with no bidding and PvP elements.\r\nRoster wise, Defense Derby offers a vast array of units and heroes to unlock and collect, providing players with long-term goals and a variety of choices. The gacha-like system adds excitement and anticipation to the hero acquisition process, enhancing the sense of discovery and progression, but of course comes at a downside of introducing pay to win elements. As a live service game, Defense Derby goes beyond the core gameplay, offering various activities and events such as Adventure mode and Guilds. Defense Derby also features a progression system reminiscent of battle passes, offering tiered rewards to players who engage in continuous gameplay.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5989547?share_id=5a00978d69ca&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game offers a diverse range of units inspired by the fantasy genre, including mages, archers, swordsmen, riflemen, and wizards. Each unit possesses unique attributes, attack ranges, and attack types, allowing players to develop diverse tactical approaches.\r\nDefense Derby features a fun multiplayer mode, known as \"Derby.\" In this mode, four players compete individually, in their own castles, to survive waves of enemies. The last castle standing emerges as the victorious player. Aside from watching your own castle defense, you can also spectate your opponents castles and see how they fare. What sets Derby apart is the innovative bidding system. Prior to each round, players construct their deck of cards by bidding on available options. Initially, players start with two cards, and subsequent bidding rounds determine additional cards and limit opponents' choices.\r\nThe bidding process is the backbone of the PvP gameplay in Defense Derby. It introduces a strategic layer where players must balance their resources and determine the optimal bid for each card. Winning bids secure desired cards, depleting opponents' options and resources. However, overbidding can result in resource scarcity for subsequent rounds, while underbidding risks losing access to vital units. The bidding system results in a compelling blend of resource management, psychological tactics, and calculated decision-making.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5989546) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Some aspects of the game may have been updated or changed since the time of writing.\r\nNot to be confused with Hearthstone's Tavern Brawl game mode, Tavern Brawls is an unrelated brand-new mobile game that combines elements of Hearthstone's card gameplay and Auto Chess's automated resolution of battles into one engaging mash-up. It has recently been released on a soft launch for Android and iOS.\r\nTavern Brawls' gameplay features a card battle system with tactical and resource management elements. Players choose a hero character to lead the battle, each with their own unique characteristics and modifiers. For example, one hero may have higher base health at the start, while another may possess an activated skill to buff a card of their choice per round.\r\nThe fundamental gameplay revolves around a straightforward mechanic. In each round, players are granted an increasing amount of gold, which they can use to purchase and deploy randomized cards with their own characteristics, offensive and defensive ratings. Strategic placement of units becomes crucial, following the conventions of auto chess, it determines the outcome of battles based on the highest offensive and lowest defensive ratings of the combatant’s decks. Proper gold management and clever utilization of card effect synergies are also vital aspects of the game.\r\nThe artwork and elements featured in these cards revolve around traditional fantasy tropes familiar to us all: Orcs, Humans, Elves, and Dwarves. The cards are intricately detailed, visually distinct from each other, and easy to identify. Unlike Auto Chess but similar to Hearthstone, the game features no-nonsense card battle action—conflicts are resolved directly without showy or flashy animations or prolonged presentations. It's a simple interaction of cards bumping into each other and inflicting damage.\r\nTavern Brawls offers two distinct modes: Arena and Fight mode. While I couldn't find how to activate the supposedly PvP mode Arena and play it, I was able to play the Fight mode which is – as far as I know — in singleplayer. It's somewhat surprising to see the lack of an actual PvP mode in a card game, as the game seems to be predominantly played in single-player mode at the moment.\r\nThe aforementioned card battle format is featured in Fight mode, but there is a slight asymmetry in terms of how damage is dealt to opposing heroes. As the player, your hero has certain health points that are slowly deducted every time you lose a round. If you lose all your health points, you lose the match. On the other hand, the enemy doesn't have health points to deplete. Instead, every round you win earns you a trophy, and accumulating a certain number of trophies results in a match win.\r\nThe combat is engaging, fun, and offers strategic and varied card battle action. However, one limitation of the game lies in its encouragement of same-race combos within the deck lineup, limiting the potential combinations and synergies. More diversity in deck-building options could enhance strategic depth and add further excitement to the gameplay.\r\nThe single-player aspect I've tried becomes increasingly difficult, and by the Silver rank, the difficulty spike becomes so high that it's almost impossible to gain all the trophies in a match. It requires intense grinding to progress further. Although the game features leaderboards and potentially an option to combat other players' decks in an asymmetric player mode down the line, those elements were not available during the soft launch.\r\nAs a free-to-play and live service game, Tavern Brawls also includes progression elements tied to the cards. You can upgrade their initial stats using gold and resources gathered by playing the game or by purchasing them with real money. This aspect introduces some pay-to-win elements into the game.\r\nOverall, as it is in this soft launch, the game feels very barebones right now, which isn't always a bad thing. However, objectively speaking, there isn't much to do in the game at the moment. Many aspects feels simple and lacking. The menus, upgrading mechanics, resource system, seasonal battle pass, and even the in-game store all feel underdeveloped and incomplete.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5986474?share_id=5be0b81e06ee&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game offers a degree of openness, enabling players to explore towns, interact with NPCs, engage in trading, and partake in side activities like bulletin board or dungeon crawling.\r\nKnightingale possesses the same allure as other JRPG games, boasting a beautiful soundtrack, turn-based combat, narrative-focused gameplay, Japanese voice acting, and an anime-inspired art style.\r\nThe characters can either do a normal attack move or a special attack move with the use of SP which are generated after every turn and persist on subsequent encounters. When encountering powerful monsters and bosses, more powerful abilities called Soul attacks are also possible once the party’s soul meter is charged.  Depending on the weapons or items equipped, characters can also change stances which will change their normal and special moves. As such, weapons effectively determine the character’s moveset, with up to two equipped at a time\r\nOverall, this game seems to offer an enjoyable experience with interesting strategic possibilities stemming from its weapon-ability system. Additionally, it takes advantage of the HD-2D graphics popularized by Octopath Traveler, adding a visually appealing element that gives it an edge over many contemporaries. It's still in closed beta testing for now with a focus on refining the gameplay and story, with plans to add in-app purchase along the way.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5989629?share_id=6eb59220ec53&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Knightingale\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nKnightingale is an upcoming HD-2D RPG game with an adventurous story, engaging turn-based combat, and traditional gacha mechanics.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Beautiful soundtrack\r\n- HD-2D graphics\r\n- Flexible weapon and ability mechanics\r\n- Skipping the story cutscene still gives you a text summary## Cons\r\n-Only runs in 16:9 aspect ratio; which doesn’t fit with the majority of mobile phones\r\n-Still needs a lot more polish with bugs\r\nKnightingale possesses the same allure as other JRPG games, boasting a beautiful soundtrack, turn-based combat, narrative-focused gameplay, Japanese voice acting, and an anime-inspired art style.\r\nThe story starts up a bit melodramatic and honestly nonsensical, involving three cursed pirates cursed upon stealing a treasure, but swiftly transitions to a more familiar narrative trope centered around Arthur, a young boy yearning to escape his ordinary life to become an Elven Knight. Accompanied by his friend Beth, acquired companions from the gacha system, and an Elf ally, they embark on a thrilling adventure.\r\nThe introduction sequence isn’t skippable, but after the tutorial ends, many of the cutscenes can now be skipped, and a short summary of the skipped parts will be shown, which is a welcome feature that allows players to remain updated on the narrative even if they choose to skip certain scenes.\r\nKnightingale's HD-2D visuals bear resemblance to the art style of Octopath Traveler, but with cleaner and more cartoonish character details. However, I found that the chibi renditions of the characters don't accurately represent their anime counterparts. At times, the chibi characters appear quite feminine, despite the full versions exhibiting a more masculine appearance.\r\nThe gameplay revolves around forming a party of five combatants from the available heroes, progressing through the story, and encountering formidable opponents. The game offers a degree of openness, enabling players to explore towns, interact with NPCs, engage in trading, and partake in side activities like bulletin board or dungeon crawling.\r\nWhile Knightingale developers have mentioned incorporating rogue-like elements, the only aspects that remotely resemble rogue-like gameplay are the dungeon crawling segments and the random rewards found in dungeon chests. There are no permadeath mechanics — which are the defining feature of rogue-likes — present in the game.\r\nBattles in Knightingale are turn-based and occur in instanced battles upon encounters with enemy units. Characters can execute normal attacks or special moves using SP, which regenerate after each turn and persist in subsequent encounters. When confronting powerful monsters and bosses, the party's soul meter charges, allowing for the use of potent Soul attacks.\r\nThrough the use of different weapons or items, characters can assume various stances, altering their normal and special moves. This feature effectively ties a character's moveset to their equipped weapons, with two different weapons equipped at a time.\r\nFor instance, Arthur can transition between swordfighting and dagger wielding, Beth seamlessly shifts between healing and buffing, and Harris switches between melee and ranged attacks. The diverse weapon affinities found among the gacha heroes provide interesting gameplay possibilities. Some can transition from support to archery, while some seamlessly switch from sword fighting to being a healer.\r\nThe party formation system consists of two rows: the front row and the back row, which is the same for enemy parties. Attacks and abilities target either the front row, back row, or both simultaneously. However, players cannot specify individual enemy targets, relying on the inherent front or back row preferences of moves. Combined with the stance-changing mechanic, this offers engaging gameplay depth.\r\nTo add more depth to the gameplay, Knightingale incorporates a traditional rock-paper-scissors elemental system. Each hero possesses their own elemental affinities, which can result in bonuses or penalties based on the enemy they face.\r\nThe game provides convenient features such as fast-forwarding and automated battles, which are unlocked early on. These options cater to players who prefer a more idle gameplay style. However, the developers could further double down on this accessibility feature by introducing an autopilot system “go-to objective” option during exploration phases, which currently require manual navigation.\r\nIt's worth noting that Knightingale is a free-to-play live service mobile game, subject to gacha mechanics and in-app purchases. While the closed beta test is currently underway only focusing on gameplay and story without in-app purchases, the final model of the game remains to be seen. I hope the developers strike a balance that ensures an enjoyable experience for free-to-play players.\r\nOn to the polishing side of things, the closed beta version of Knightingale reveals some barebones aspects, including UI bugs and a lack of quality-of-life features. The game only currently runs in a 16:9 screen aspect ratio that results in black bars on most mobile phones, and there are instances where the minimap fails to function properly, displaying a static image. Additionally, the positioning of the joystick slightly higher than usual leads to frustrations with movement controls. Unfortunately, there is currently no option to customize its position. However, players do have the alternative of using the touch screen control mode, allowing characters to move based on the player's touch input.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5989702?share_id=818de021d35a&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "lyndonguitar\r\nMadtale is a mobile idle RPG game that puts players in a dark fairy tale world filled with captivating stories and charming characters — heroes and villains, both familiar or not.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A captivating fairy tale storyline\r\n- Great Art Style\r\n- Wonderful voice acting and a fitting soundtrack\r\n- Battles are visually pleasing\r\n- Plethora of game modes to unlock and play## Cons\r\n-The combat is too automated, making battles feel pre-determined with almost zero player input needed\r\n-Ironically, other non-combat aspects are lacking much needed automation\r\n-Performance issues given the 2D visuals\r\nWith its unique art style, engaging narratives, and various gameplay features, Madtale aims to offer an enjoyable gaming experience for players on iOS and Android devices with its recent release last July 12.\r\nMadtale features a delightful and cute cartoonish art style that adds a whimsical charm to the game. The vibrant visuals bring the fairy tale world to life with enchanting character designs and imaginative environments that feels like it came out from a children’s illustration book. The intricate animations and vibrant visuals further enhance the overall visual appeal, however I did find some performance issues surprising given the 2D visuals, having experienced some consistent lags during character abilities.\r\nThe game also offers wonderful voiceovers for its characters, giving them distinct personalities and adding depth to their dialogues. The dialogues are fully voice acting with impressive performances, and it feels like I’m listening to a real fairy tale dialogue. The background music complements the gameplay, setting the mood and immersing players in the enchanting atmosphere.\r\nMadtale features a captivating plot. With the main protagonist being Little Red Riding Hood, players embark on a journey through a world filled with fairy tale characters like Snow White with intertwined narratives. The game draws players into the intriguing plot and entices them to uncover more about the mysteries of the fairy tale world.\r\nMadtale offers an overworld adventure mode in the story that allows players to roam around the children’s book looking world and encounter various opponents in a chapter-ized manner. The seamless transition to battles without loading screens is a nice feature, enhancing the immersion and overall flow of the gameplay.\r\nThe combat system of Madtale predominantly employs idle gameplay, requiring minimal brain power from the player. When the performance is good, the battles are visually satisfying, thanks to the powerful abilities and flashy special effects. Nevertheless, the lack of control over the characters during battles is a significant drawback, and the heavy focus on idle gameplay becomes its own detriment.\r\nBattles in Madtale unfold completely in auto mode, leaving players with minimal agency without any option to take control at any point in the combat. The game heavily relies on team power and the “camp” system to resolve battles, diminishing the strategic depth and making battles feel predetermined.\r\nDespite being a bit contradictory, this aspect might disappoint players seeking a more engaging idle combat experience. This is further exacerbated by the fact that in some of the additional game modes and within the main story itself, you still need to manually control the character in order to progress through the chapters and levels. In short, the combat becomes too automated, while other aspects are lacking much needed automation.\r\nHowever, the inclusion of upgradable heroes called Partners that are mostly acquired via a gacha system, with unique skills and equippable weapons adds some level of strategy and encourages players to strategize and utilize these powerful skills effectively. Battles can also be sped up and skipped, but faster speed settings are rather part of the progression instead of a full-on feature, which can be unlocked as you progress through the story.\r\nMadtale incorporates the aforementioned camp system that employs a familiar rock-paper-scissors counter dynamic. Just like in other games with similar “elemental” mechanics, certain camps will have advantages over others, creating a mechanic where players must also consider their camp choices when building their teams and engaging in battles, aside from pure power rating.\r\nAdditionally, the game provides various additional features to engage players. Building up guilds to defeat bosses adds a cooperative element to the gameplay, allowing players to collaborate with others and unlock additional rewards. The Memorial Palace offers plot stories to unlock, adding depth and context to the game's lore. The Arena provides an opportunity for 1v1 combat against real players, giving players some competitive action.\r\nMadtale also introduces roguelike adventures such as the Giant’s Garden, Polluted Prison and Underground Ruins, where players can explore randomized floors, defeat bosses, choose random modifiers, and earn rewards. The element of randomness adds excitement and unpredictability to the gameplay, keeping players on their toes and giving them endless replayable content aside from the main story. Overall, the game offers a range of live service features beyond the main storyline and Idle gameplay, such as gacha collecting, login bonuses, events, and in-app purchases.\r\nBeing a gacha game, Madtale also feels like a low-key waifu collector that features a diverse range of female fairy tale characters, including both familiar and fresh faces. While there is indeed a waifu-ish approach in this game, it's important to note that not every character in the game is female.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/5992003?share_id=039529614ab5&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players start by selecting a character from a flavorful roster, each with their own unique personality, attack types, and upgradable stats that are upgradable as you progress throughout the game and collect more materials. The attack types are closely tied to the character and their weapon. Additionally, players have the option to bring in up to four supporting characters, essentially forming their weapon pool.\r\nAs players progress through the game, they face waves of enemies and challenging boss battles. Defeating enemies fills an experience bar, and when filled enables players to select upgrades from a random selection of three rewards. These upgrades can range from new weapons or modifiers to increased attack speed or damage, empowering players and allowing them to become even more formidable in that specific run.\r\nThe levels vary in size and present additional obstacles and hazards as extra challenges, dying enemies may explode, the map can block or damage you in ways that will possibly make it frustrating, it gets increasingly hard on the way to the boss, and the game overall definitely feels more challenging than Vampire Survivors or Brotato. From time to time, you are given chances to heal and recuperate. You can also leave your game and continue it for later, which is a nice quality of life feature even if it has roguelike elements\r\nAs a rogue-like game, not everything is reset when you fail a run. There are persistent progress to be made, as especially character systems where you can upgrade characters into different tiers, and the card systems where different kinds of “customer” cards are unlockable, which will give permanent bonuses right from the start of runs that would otherwise be obtainable only as in-run temporary upgrades.\r\nLimbo Disco is planned to be a free-to-play game, as such, it also has many of the usual F2P elements rolled into this game, like an energy system to keep playing, optional ads to continue playing or get additional resource boosts, and gacha mechanics to unlock new characters or perhaps upgrade them to a higher tier. It also has familiar features like login bonuses, tasks and challenges.\r\nWhile these F2P elements exist, in my experience with the beta, Limbo Disco can be entirely playable without spending money. The game offers a fair balance between free and premium content, and players who embrace the added grind and challenge of the F2P model will find an arguably more rewarding experience. The game's value lies in its gameplay depth and progression systems, ensuring that players can enjoy the game even without making in-app purchases.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6008736?share_id=945dd9e952ec&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Developed initially for the Nintendo Switch and PC platforms, it has now made its way to Android and iOS devices just this July, and I was able to play the free demo of this game for Android.\r\nLost in Play features hand-drawn, cartoonish visuals that are visually pleasing and perfectly complement the game's playful atmosphere. While inspired by classic cartoons, the graphics are somewhat modernized and polished, creating a vibrant and colorful world. The characters' stylish design, vivid dreamscapes, and imaginative creatures all contribute to the game's whimsical universe. The art style is pleasing to the eyes, and would definitely be a draw for kids but not necessarily for them only, you could tell that the developers put a lot of effort in it as an artwork.\r\nThe accompanying soundtrack is equally enchanting, with music that seamlessly blends fantasy and mystery. While there is no dialogue, the characters communicate through gibberish sounds, reminiscent of The Sims, which adds a touch of whimsy to their interactions and adds an extra playful nature as opposed to if it were a completely silent game, or a fully voiced one. Despite the lack of dialogue, the characters' gibberish sounds effectively convey their thoughts and feelings, fostering a sense of connection between players and the adorable protagonists.\r\nLost in Play combines adventure and puzzle-solving elements to create an engaging gameplay experience. Players assume the roles of Toto and Gal, guiding them through various dreamscapes and challenging puzzles. The puzzles range from classic point-and-click environmental puzzles to interactive \"in-your-screen\" puzzles.\r\nThe puzzle design is thoughtful and well-balanced, offering a variety of challenges that cater to different types of thinking. Whether it's figuring out the right sequence of actions to progress or solving mechanical puzzles within the game world, players will find themselves engrossed in the gameplay. The puzzles are designed to be accessible to players of all ages, striking a balance between being challenging yet solvable. Sometimes you are tasked to solve a variety of puzzles, like beating someone in a checkers match, or perhaps solving the gears of an alarm clock to make it work.\r\nMy favorite aspect of Lost in Play is the hint system. At any point in the game, players can access hints represented by simple illustrations or drawings. These hints provide a nudge in the right direction without giving away the entire solution. It's a helpful feature that ensures players, both children and adults alike, can progress even if they find themselves stuck.\r\nLost in Play's story revolves around the sibling duo of Toto and Gal. The game starts with the player controlling Gal, who must find creative ways to capture her brother's attention and spark his imagination. Once Toto's interest is piqued, the whimsical adventure takes flight. While the story may not be elaborate or even sensical, it serves as a backdrop for the playful exploration and puzzle-solving that awaits.\r\nWith its beautiful cartoon art, captivating puzzles, and delightful narrative, Lost in Play offers a feel-good experience suitable for players of all ages. Its captivating visuals, enchanting soundtrack, and well-crafted puzzles make for an immersive and enjoyable experience, if the full game is anything like the Demo experience, and this game is surely worth a buy! Ofcourse, you can try the demo for free first.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6008543?share_id=a6e4bfd3098c&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game stands out from other battle royale titles with its emphasis on fast-paced martial arts based combat and parkour mechanics. It is available for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, with an official mobile version coming soon as well.",

    "body": "lyndonguitar\r\nGet\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fast-paced and skill-based combat\r\n- Fluid and intuitive parkour and traversal mechanics\r\n- A fresh take and a stand out experience from other battle royale games\r\n- Unique setting and AAA level of visuals## Cons\r\n-Performance issues\r\n-Requests you to disable some PC protection feature in order to play, beware\r\nThe game's vibrant and detailed environment draws inspiration from ancient Chinese landscapes, filled with lush forests, majestic mountains, and oriental looking structures. Overall, the visual presentation of NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a proper modern AAA-level of experience, although I did experience some constant stuttering or perceived lack of smoothness in the gameplay. While the game offers fast-paced and intense combat, the constant stutters and jittery in the performance, at least in the PC version, could be improved further.\r\nYou can climb towers, structures, cliffs, rocks, and even utilize grappling hooks to move around swiftly. The parkour mechanics feel like an evolved and unhinged version of those seen in games like the classic Tenchu or the more modern Sekiro. The movement system feels intuitive and responsive, giving players a heightened sense of freedom and agency in their actions.\r\nAlong with its melee-oriented action, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT incorporates traditional battle royale mechanics, such as the usual randomized circular safe zones to go into, looting items and weapons, as well as a huge map for up to 60 players to wander around. Additionally, it includes familiar quality-of-life features such as a revive system, which gives fallen players another chance instead of just sitting around only able to watch their teammates compete. Being able to revive fallen teammates adds a layer of teamwork and coordination, enhancing the overall multiplayer experience.\r\nThe game provides Trio and Duo modes right from the start, allowing you to team up with friends or play with a partner. Solo mode becomes available as you progress through the levels, although it would have been nicer if all modes are available from start.\r\nWhether you prefer close-quarters combat with swords or long-range engagements with firearms, there is a weapon that suits your style. The fluid animations add a level of satisfaction to the combat, making each strike and attack feel impactful and visually appealing. In addition to the typical loot of weapons and healing items, players have the opportunity to find and loot upgrades called souljades. These souljades function as modifiers that can enhance your character's abilities and provide upgraded acts or skill mannerisms.\r\nAs a pick-up and play game, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT features a fast-paced and intense gameplay experience, with matches typically lasting around 15 to 20 minutes. The game's map design is sprawling and intricate, providing ample opportunities for exploration and tactical maneuvering. From dense forests to ancient temples, each location feels meticulously crafted, offering a mix of verticality and open spaces that encourage dynamic gameplay. The map's size strikes a good balance, ensuring that encounters with other players are frequent but not overwhelming. Additionally, the introduction of AI-controlled creatures in the maps and in one the game modes adds an extra layer of challenge and PvE aspect to the matches.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6012973?share_id=710001d67361&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game's atmosphere is amazing, immersing you in a war-torn world where danger lurks around every corner.\r\nThe core gameplay mechanics of Arena Breakout revolves around dropping into Dark Zones, where they will need to loot for weapons, valuable items to sell, and survive enough to be able to extract and keep the loot, as failing to extract and dying will result in the loss of gear and loot.\r\nYou can extract at any point in the game, and you aren’t required to kill all adversaries in the area to continue, making the scavenging for valuable loot amidst the chaos of the battlefield both thrilling and rewarding. The risk versus reward dynamic keeps players on their toes, as they must carefully weigh the potential gains against the dangers of engaging adversaries. The satisfaction of surviving to acquire and keep rare and powerful items serves as a core gameplay loop of the game.\r\nMechanics wise, Arena Breakout incorporates various hardcore mechanics from Escape From Tarkov, a PC game known for its realistic and intense gameplay. The slow and methodical animations contribute to a more realistic and deliberate feel to the gameplay. The persistent magazine cycling reloading system is another mechanic that adds realism and tactical decision-making. Being mindful of the remaining ammunition in a magazine and the need to manage reloads can significantly impact gameplay. This mechanic encourages players to plan their actions and consider the right moments to reload, as well as the potential consequences of running out of ammunition in critical situations.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6013625?share_id=e89ce6986f13&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Roto Force\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nRoto Force is a retro-inspired twin-stick shooter that turns the genre on its own with its unique take. Instead of moving around the levels freely, you move around the inverted planet-esque environment. You move around the level like a hamster on a wheel and try to avoid enemies that usually spawn at the center. Despite it being retro in its aesthetics and soundtrack, the gameplay couldn't be more modern with its fluid touch-based controls and movement mechanics.\r\nAs a new intern at Roto Force, you’ll go on missions through the game’s variety of worlds and environments, battling different kinds of enemies and bosses. The pixel art style captures the essence of retro games, and the monotonous and somewhat limited color palette adds a touch of genuine retro authenticity to the experience. Accompanying the visuals is an energetic and catchy soundtrack that perfectly complements the fast-paced gameplay.\r\nRoto Force's gameplay mechanics set it apart from other twin-stick shooters. As mentioned before, instead of freely moving around levels, you move around an inverted planet-like environment, reminiscent of a hamster on a wheel, and you must constantly maneuver to avoid enemies spawning at the center. It's a refreshing twist that keeps the action literally centered on the screen.\r\nAside from moving left and right around the level, the character can also aim and dash around the circle by swiping up with the left stick. It may be a little confusing and difficult to do at first, but it becomes second nature pretty quickly. In line with the dash mechanic, bubbles will occasionally appear to protect enemies, as well as health and weapon pickups that need to be dashed into to become accessible.\r\nAdditionally, the character can aim with the right stick and shoot projectiles at enemies, with the manner of attack determined by the weapon type. In the demo I've played, there are only two kinds of weapons: regular rapid fire and homing rockets, both of which are equally effective. Overall, the controls in Roto Force are straightforward and easy to grasp. However, the gameplay itself offers a unique experience that I haven't encountered in any other game before.\r\nAfter progressing through the levels and encountering a variety of enemy types including mini-bosses, the end of each chapter lies a boss fight. These boss fights are fairly challenging but nothing seems unfair. They all have certain movesets and animations that, once figured out, will prove to be easy. It may initially seem like just another rogue-like game, but it's not. Dying in Roto Force is not unforgiving; instead, it reloads you back at convenient checkpoints, providing players with the opportunity to easily retry boss fights and levels, without starting from scratch. It's not a very complex game in terms of mechanics and progressing, but it's mindless fun nonetheless.\r\nDuring my experience with the early access demo, I had the opportunity to play the first level, defeat its boss, and try out two different weapons.. In the full version, which has now been released this July 18, players can look forward to accessing a total of 9 unique weapons, 30 challenging mini-bosses, and 10 epic bosses. They have also included generous accessibility options to cater to a wide range of players. These options include the ability to slow down the game speed, increase damage output, and even grant infinite health.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6017207?share_id=a740b681337c&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Betrayed by her former team, Red sets out on a relentless journey for revenge.\r\nAs players control Red and ISAAC, they navigate through a variety of challenging levels that combine strategic decision-making with turn-based puzzle-like combat sequences, providing a unique blend of gameplay mechanics.\r\nThe visuals in Red Ronin boast a captivating retro-inspired aesthetic that blends samurai and cyberpunk elements very well. The game's art direction pays homage to classic pixel art styles, evoke a sense of nostalgia while capturing the essence of a dystopian cyberpunk setting. Accompanying the captivating visuals is a lo-fi 16-bit music soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's retro-cyberpunk atmosphere.\r\nThe gameplay revolves around Red, a Samurai so fast that she cannot stop her own movements—only walls and furniture can. Initially, the movement mechanics felt weird, allowing the player to only make dash movements in one direction, one turn at a time. The dash is unstoppable until Red encounters walls or obstacles, resembling how tiles are moved in the game 2048. Players dash until Red bumps into something, then in the next turn, dash again in another direction. There are no limits to the dash; it's possible to cross an entire room in one turn, as long as there are no obstacles in the way.\r\nThe controls are somewhat lazily done for the Android version. The developers just slapped a virtual gamepad overlay on the screen and called it a day. However, it surprisingly works for the most part, and is non issue for how the game works.\r\nDespite the initial weirdness of the movement mechanics, all of it makes sense pretty much immediately. The coolness factor sets in once you start to meet enemies and begin to slash them one by one like a badass lightning fast Samurai. Unfortunately, Red’s speed is to her own detriment, as mistimed movements or poor positioning leave her vulnerable to enemy attacks. A single hit means failure, so players must time their actions carefully and strategize to avoid stopping one tile away from an enemy and being struck.\r\nTo aid in avoiding damage, Red possesses two replenishable abilities. One ability freezes enemies, temporarily immobilizing them for one turn, providing a momentary reprieve to escape a deadly position. The other ability allows Red to change set a change in direction mid-dash, enabling her to navigate tricky situations. These abilities are limited and can only be replenished by collecting ability pickups scattered throughout the levels, further enhancing the puzzle-like design of the game.\r\nThis unique gameplay concept delivers a challenging experience that can best be described as a literal puzzle game disguised as a cyberpunk turn-based hack and slash, seamlessly integrating the puzzle elements into the combat mechanics. After each chapter, the player is scored based on his/her time, killstreaks, and deaths.\r\nWhile there is a narrative surrounding Red's revenge story, it is not expected to delve deeply into complexity. It serves primarily as a backdrop for Red's relentless pursuit of enemies and progression through levels. I have only played the demo, which included the first level, but the experience has been positive thus far except for some minor visual and animation bugs. For the full version of the game, it is set to include 5 hours of content for the entire story campaign.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6018031?share_id=317d55c6708a&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dumb Ways to Climb\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nDumb Ways to Climb, developed by PlaySide Studios Ltd, attempts to combine the charm of the Dumb Ways to Die franchise with the viral gameplay of the popular vertical platformer PC game Only Up!.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Nice graphics\r\n- Nerve-racking platforming experience## Cons\r\n-Clunky and unresponsive control scheme\r\n-Primitive touch controls\r\n-No menu, no settings, no options\r\n-Levels that felt uninspired\r\n-Feels like an asset flip, if it isn’t actually one\r\n-Awful performance\r\nDumb Ways to Climb is a platforming game where the only goal is to go upwards. As a bean-like character ripped straight from the cartoon series Dumb Ways to Die, you must climb up a random mishmash contraption of worldly objects, with the sole objective being to reach higher heights, similar to the recent popular game Only Up!. It’s quite obvious that the gameplay concept has been shamelessly borrowed from the aforementioned game, only this time, Dumb Ways to Climb was made specifically for Android and iOS platform.\r\nDumb Ways to Climb features no main menus, no settings, and just straight up starts the platforming run right upon launch. One might consider this a no-nonsense approach, but that didn’t feel right because this game is actually full of nonsense, for better or for worse.\r\nThe graphics in Dumb Ways to Climb are actually quite impressive for a mobile game, and could potentially rival the original PC game Only Up! in terms of visual fidelity. However, similar to Only Up!, most of the content in this game feels like asset flips. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that the game being an asset flip doesn't really matter if the gameplay is good.\r\nHowever, while Only Up! still has some semblance of playability, Dumb Ways to Climb is much more buggy and the control scheme is clunky and unresponsive, making the game considerably harder and more frustrating to play. The touch control implementation felt primitive to use and exacerbated the problem. the performance just outright sucks, there isn’t even a graphics options settings so you can tweak the performance.\r\nAs a platformer, I cannot deny that Dumb Ways to Climb does provide a nerve-racking experience. The slow ascent through the nonsensical contraptions can be exhilarating, as a single misstep can send you tumbling back to the bottom, requiring a restart. The levels overall, while in the same ballpark as Only Up! with terms of being an insane random collection of objects and structures, felt significantly more uninspired and lack creativity. It felt like this game was hastily created to capitalize on the viral popularity of Only Up!.\r\nInterestingly, Dumb Ways to Climb was developed by PlaySide Studios Ltd, the same developers who created the official Dumb Ways to Die mobile games and hold the rights to the franchise. Despite being the owners of the intellectual property and actually coming out with some pretty cool mobile games previously, this particular game may not live up to the quality and creativity expected from the series.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6018267?share_id=dc3869f6f178&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Viewfinder\r\nViewfinder is a puzzle game where players reshape reality by placing works of art in the world. Uncover mysteries, solve engaging puzzles, and explore captivating environments in this innovative and imaginative journey of discovery.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Innovative mind bending puzzle mechanics\r\n- The puzzles are consistently engaging and satisfying to solve\r\n- Visually pleasing art style\r\n- Subtle and player-driven narrative## Cons\r\n-Limited complexity in its puzzle mechanics\r\n-Lack of story depth despite the interesting premise\r\nViewfinder is a first-person adventure game that offers players an extraordinary experience of mind bending perceptions and reshaping the fabric of reality. The game introduces players to a world where photography becomes their key to manipulating the environment, solving puzzles, and finding answers to solving an impossible question.\r\nViewfinder's narrative takes a subtle and player-driven approach. The game's plot unfolds through environmental storytelling and uncovering the mysteries left behind; Stumbling upon audio recordings of the past, discovering abandoned houses, and investigating ancient technology. It definitely feels like I was playing Portal back again, with the similar approaches in storytelling and puzzle gameplay.\r\nThe actual plot revolves around the player and their companion over voice-comms, investigating an ancient technology that makes the premise of reality shaping possible, and embarking on a quest to find answers to this mystery. It's hard to describe even initials of plot in detail without spoiling it, so I'll just leave it at that. Storytelling-wise, the story is kind of open-ended and up to the player to discover and deduce. It works decently as background flavor to the puzzle-solving gameplay, but I did not feel that it is a necessary nor a must-experience story to be had. You can just skip straight right to the puzzles and still enjoy this game.\r\nThe art style adds a unique charm and distinctiveness to Viewfinder, creating an stylized 3D enchanting world that resembles a clay-like aesthetic, while also sometimes going into different art styles depending on the photo or sketch used to change the environment. For example, photocopies of photographs will result in a black and white or grayscale environment.\r\nArtistic drawings, children’s sketches, or pixelated images will come to life exactly as they are. The varying art style changes are cool, but they never really get around to utilizing it and the game just sticks to the main art style for the entirety of the experience, which is a huge waste of opportunity.\r\nViewfinder's gameplay revolves around the use of photographs and related tools that empowers players to reshape the environment by bringing photographs, sketches, paintings, and other visuals into life. The core mechanic is easy to grasp, making it accessible to players of all skill levels. Players can move around and interact with the environment in a traditional FPS manner. Players can pick up objects, interact with puzzle elements, and utilize different tools.\r\nObservation is a key aspect of the gameplay, you must analyze your environment carefully, the photography related tools available at your disposal, and the actual photographs available in the world to utilize. Once a deduction is made, you must place that photograph into the world and watch it come to life and delete everything behind. How it's placed in the world is all according to your perspective during its placement.\r\nYou can rotate these photographs too, so it’s entirely possible to place photos in any orientation. Perhaps a photograph of the side of a building can be used as a ramp, or perhaps a photograph of a bridge can be used as an actual bridge itself.\r\nThe ability to manipulate reality by placing pictures in the world is genuinely innovative, although it does feel familiar due to the pioneering mechanics of the game Superliminal. In addition to altering the world by literally placing photographs, the player character can also rewind time, making it easy to redo a mistake, retrieve a lost item, or perhaps overcome being stuck. And believe me, these situations will happen; important world objects can disappear when you accidentally place a photograph in front of them, leaving you no choice but to rewind to progress.\r\nPlayers are encouraged to explore every nook and cranny to uncover secrets, solve puzzles, and piece together the underlying narrative. The freedom to experiment with the tools and freely rewind adds depth to the gameplay, allowing for multiple solutions to puzzles and encouraging creativity. Throughout the whole experience, the puzzles are consistently engaging and are all satisfying to solve. Speaking of tools, sometimes you are given a camera to actually take a scene and replace it in another location later, sometimes there is a photocopier so you can duplicate photographs, other times there are fixed cameras placed in the environment waiting to be utilized.\r\nWhile the main puzzles are enjoyable and well-designed, they may lack complexity for experienced puzzle-solving games and the solutions are almost always intuitively obvious to the player. The inclusion of optional puzzles and challenges throughout the chapters caters to players seeking more intricate gameplay, but even with the optional challenges, I found the game to be short and only offers around five hours of content. While the game's length is reasonable, the replayability may be limited, especially for those who will immensely enjoy the unique puzzle mechanics of the game, and will be definitely looking for more.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6032178?share_id=3ff7cafa7378&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The event is set to take players on an unforgettable journey filled with new game modes, exclusive skins, and epic battles until August, for all four games across various platforms including iOS and Android, at least for its mobile game offerings like League of Legends: Wild Rift.\r\nLeague of Legends: Wild Rift will receive six alluring Soul Fighter skins that allow players to embody the essence of these legendary champions in a way never seen before; Nilah, two versions of Draven, Yasuo, Irelia, Xin Zhao.\r\nThere is a \"Soul Fighter Bounty\" special promotion that offers players a chance to obtain the Special Edition skin of Draven. Players will need to purchase boxes, each priced at 400 Wild Cores. These boxes offer an opportunity to receive various rewards, including the rare and exclusive Soul Fighter Draven (Special Edition) skin for a 0.50% chance, as well as differing rates of vouchers that can also be used to purchase other skins, emotes, and other in-game cosmetics.\r\nThe event also brings an exclusive in-client narrative experience to Wild Rift.

The Tag Duel mode is available exclusively during the \"Soul Fighter\" event, commencing on July 21st and concluding on August 7th.\r\nPrior to the duel, Summoners will carefully select three champions from their vast roster which will share a single health bar for the fight. During the battle, players can then seamlessly switch between their three chosen champions. However, this strategic maneuver will consume super meter charges, adding an element of resource management.\r\nAll cooldowns are refunded during character switches, encouraging swapping and synergistic combos between champions. For the itemization, champions will automatically purchase items and level up throughout the match, streamlining the gameplay experience and keeping the focus on the intense combat.\r\nIn Teamfight Tactics on the other hand, the event brings a new game mode called Soul Brawl, along with a narrative experience and an Event Pass. Players can also enjoy the addition of Chibi Gwen and Chibi Soul Fighter Gwen as new tacticians. Meanwhile, Legends of Runeterra features a new event pass along with emotes, cosmetics, and cardbacks during the Soul Fighter event.\r\nGetting the most content out of all, League of Legends brings thrilling new game modes called 2v2v2v2 Arena and the fighting mini-game Tournament of Souls. In Arena, four teams of two players each engage in rotating combat rounds. After each round, teams power up with unique Augments until only one team remains victorious. The battles take place in four different battlefields, each varying in size, terrain density, and theme. The event also introduces a formidable new champion named Naafiri, the Hound of a Hundred Bite, plus new Soul Fighter themed skins, some of them with Prestige versions.\r\nAcross all the four games, the Soul Fighter cross game summer event is a limited-time event only, from July 20 to August 28.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6037529?share_id=326a882cf706&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Tower of God: NEW WORLD\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nTower of God: New World is an upcoming mobile idle RPG game, based on the original Webtoon Tower of God created by S.I.U. This mobile game retells the story of Twenty Fifth Bam's quest to find his friend Rachel within the mysterious Tower, while inserting the player’s journey into the fold. As players traverse the Tower, they encounter newfound allies who aid them in their journey.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful story retelling while also telling a new story\r\n- Best-in-class mobile game visuals\r\n- Three voice-over options, with the original Anime Japanese actors returning\r\n- Refreshing gameplay mechanics## Cons\r\n-Departure from the original manhwa art style\r\nPlayable in vertical mode, Tower of God: New World features stunning and clean cel-shaded anime-esque graphics that are on-par or even better with some of the best looking mobile titles out there like Genshin Impact. The characters and backgrounds are beautifully designed, even the abilities of characters are accompanied by unique animated cutscenes, which adds extra to the presentation, at least in the first few bits before the novelty wears off and you turn off the cutscene option.\r\nSound wise, fans will be delighted to hear that the original Japanese voice actors for the anime are returning in this game In addition, Tower of God: New World includes the option to switch between Japanese, English, and Korean voice-overs, accommodating players with different language preferences, which is pretty uncommon in mobile games.\r\nSome fans of the original Webtoon might not appreciate the anime-zation of the game and departure from the original manhwa art style, some characters are redesigned or made to look more anime-like. Nevertheless, the visual quality of the game overall is impressive and does justice to the source material.\r\nIn Tower of God: New World, players assume the role of a new character inserted into the narrative, following Bam's footsteps and experiencing the adventure firsthand. The game introduces a new player-named character, along with his navigator and tutorial guide Rin, bridging the gameplay mechanics with the overarching storyline. Through Rin's guidance, players become an integral part of the Tower's world, forging their path, and interacting with iconic characters.\r\nThe plot is divided into two parts: the current plot, which revolves around the player-created character's journey through the Tower, and the story mode, which allows the character to access and relive the memories of Bam. This means that players not only embark on their unique adventure but also have the opportunity to relive and retell the events of the original Webtoon in a summarized but informative manner.\r\nThe gameplay involves team building, choosing the right party members, and utilizing materials to level up character slots, and weapons to progress through the Tower and Story. The game also features a gacha system where players can summon characters from the Tower of God universe, including iconic characters from the original Webtoon.\r\nAs an idle game, Tower of God: New World doesn't require players to actively engage in combat, except for optionally choosing when to utilize ultimate skills. The primary focus lies in team building and selecting the appropriate team members depending on the enemy.\r\nThe characters are classified into different roles and elements, akin to a rock-paper-scissors type of interaction. Leveraging elemental strengths can be advantageous, dealing double damage to opponents, while weaker elements result in halved damage.\r\nA notable feature is the Shinsu Link mechanic with the character slots, replacing traditional character leveling. Players level up Shinsu Links tied to the formation and deployment of their party members. This refreshing system provides the freedom to freely team build without concerns about investing too much in individual character levels and without much penalty for swapping characters with newly acquired ones. Overall the gameplay feels smooth and polished, and I have encountered no bugs or even performance issues with the game. The combat is satisfying to watch, and the quality of life brought forth by the Shinsu Link mechanic reduces a lot of potential grind.\r\nThe game offers numerous ways to develop and customize characters. Alongside the usual itemization system for different character types, there's the Limit Break feature that enhances a character's skills. To do this, players need to obtain duplicates of specific characters to obtain the necessary materials. Furthermore, the Proficiency and Rapport systems boost a character's stats, providing even more depth to character progression.\r\nTower of God: New World impresses with its diverse array of game modes, offering something for everyone. The Story Mode successfully retells the Tower of God narrative, engaging players with its intriguing plotline. The Adventure Mode stands out as players climb floor after floor, defeating enemies to ascend higher in the Tower. The Expedition section encompasses various modes like Trail Area, Arena, Conquest Mode, and Battle Facility. All in all keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.\r\nLike many mobile games, Tower of God: New World incorporates a gacha system where players can summon characters from the Tower of God universe. The option to hand-pick five characters from the SSR pool with a rate up is a significant bonus, which makes it easier to target and acquire these coveted characters. Additionally, the SSR pity system, triggered after 100 pulls, allows players to select and obtain an SSR character from the banner. After 200 pulls, players receive an SSR+ bonus, granting them a chance to change the summoned character if it's not their desired choice.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6040728?share_id=0dd7029fc689&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

As a survivor in the far future, you must venture outside the Vault to embark on a quest to find the Core of Creation—the crucial element that holds the key to saving the world.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Gunplay is satisfying, with emphasis on accuracy and precision over guns blazing\r\n- JRPG style overworld map exploration, role-playing, and decision making\r\n- Talent respecs are totally free and can be done anytime\r\n- Crossplay and cross-progression between Mobile and PC## Cons\r\n-The story premise is interesting but feels underutilized\r\n-Lack of attention to the movement system and controls\r\n-Mobile version performance optimization needs work\r\n## 📝Notable points: These pros and cons are based on early (2023) build and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product when it finally releases.\r\nTo clear up some common misconceptions and confusions, This is the Mobile and PC MMORPG developed by Legendary Star Studio and Netease, which is different from the similarly titled Ashfall, a Web3/NFT game currently in development by Liithos Game Studio.\r\nIn Ashfall, players can choose their created character's archetype, essentially their class, from options like the Gunslinger - having increased agility, weapon speed, and accuracy; Safeguard - reduces damage taken and increases Armor; Scavenger - Increases Backpack slots and loot quality. And many others such as Mercenary, Blue Collar, Hunter, Wanderer, Bodyguard, Infiltrator, Arms Dealer, Renowned Hero, and a kind of a comic relief class named Average Joe.\r\nPlayers can also select up to two traits with varying bonuses, tailored to their playstyle and chosen archetype. The game allows players to change both the archetype and traits later on by interacting with characters, providing flexibility and avoiding being locked into initial choices.\r\nThe game begins with a glimpse of the apocalypse — the war against the robots — reminiscent of the Terminator movie, with a short tutorial teaching the basics of the third-person shooter gameplay. The story quickly shifts to the post-apocalyptic future, where humanity survives in Vaults, and players assume the role of a young survivor stepping outside for the first time. The game wastes no time in sending you out into the world, with minimal story elements taking place. The world outside is filled with enemies, from human bandits called \"Trespassers\" to mutated insect-like monsters, as well as boss-type enemies with a weakness system mechanic to help players defeat them. Overall, the story premise is interesting but feels underutilized, however it is important to note that this is only a very early build of the game.\r\nThe whole premise draws inspiration from the Fallout game series with Vaults and even numbered labels on gears, but the post-apocalyptic aesthetic leans more towards the bleak and dark reddish tones of the Metro series.\r\nGraphically, Ashfall is decent on PC, boasting above-average quality textures, models, and lighting by 2023 standards. The mobile version impresses even more despite its limited processing capability, maintaining similar fidelity to the PC version but lagging behind in performance by struggling to even achieve 60fps at low settings on my Snapdragon 888 device. Players can also customize their visual experience by choosing from various color profiles or filters to adjust the visual style to their preferences.\r\nThe core gameplay of Ashfall centers around third-person shooter mechanics combined with RPG progression, wasteland exploration, and decision-making. The movement mechanics are simplistic, adapting a cover-based shooter approach with the ability to vault around. However, some control quirks make movements feel clunky, and certain actions like vaulting over cover, crouching, or jumping are not possible. Also, the PC control scheme feels a bit weird because both the cover and vault button are bound to the same buttons, but it makes sense from a mobile standpoint. It’s a bit clunky from an animation perspective, and it's clear the movement is one of the aspects that hasn’t been given priority attention by the developers.\r\nBetween missions and shooter segments, players explore the wasteland using a point-and-click JRPG-esque overworld map system. Here, the player can encounter many different types of events on the way to their objectives. Bandit bases, random encounters, towns, and points of interest to investigate. It gives the game a little bit of role playing while exploring the world.\r\nDespite lackluster initial impressions of the gunplay during the robot war tutorial segment, the actual gunplay is satisfying. The guns feel powerful and enjoyable to control, enhanced further by powerful sounds. The shooting mechanics resemble the recent Resident Evil remakes, rewarding careful aiming and patience over going in guns blazing and spraying and praying. The guns are also crazy accurate in this game and don't seem to have any range accuracy or damage penalties. Reloading, on the other hand, feels longer than I am used to, and it kills the pacing of the shootouts more than it adds difficulty --- if that was the intention of the developers.\r\nAs players progress, they can level up and unlock talents that provide additional bonuses. Talents range from increased headshot damage to passive effects like bonus EXP from chest openings. Equipment and gear itemization with rarities are also present, along with some surface level crafting elements such as gathering resources and picking up plants to gain materials for use in crafting. Visiting towns also allows players to trade and sell their loot for “Gear” which is used as the main currency in the game’s world.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6058672) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "EA Sports FC 24\r\n8.7\r\nSports\r\nPvP\r\nEA Sports FC Mobile has entered beta right now in limited regions, just over a month before its official release. I was fortunate enough to try out two of its main game modes as well as explore a bit the game’s mechanics, such as acquiring new players, customization of your club, and soccer team.\r\nVisually, EA Sports FC Mobile impressed me with its improved graphics and smooth animations. Player models are detailed, animations are almost lifelike, and the stadiums are immersive. The only thing that didn't impress me is the 2D-looking crowd detail, which is actually fine but is sometimes unflatteringly shown by occasional bad camera work during action replays.\r\nWhile not as detailed as the console versions, especially with the upcoming next-gen EA Sports FC 24, EA Sports FC Mobile still manages to impress with its visuals. In terms of options, there is an extensive graphics customization setting that ranges from Power Saver to Ultra graphics, as well as up to 60 fps option for capable devices.\r\nWhen players begin, they will start with a basic team composed of low-rated players. The game also provides a basic tutorial to familiarize new players with the touch controls and basic gameplay mechanics.\r\nFor a mobile soccer game, the touch-based controls are intuitive, enabling players to perform passes, tackles, shots, and skill moves with relative ease. The game offers multiple control options, allowing players to choose between virtual buttons or gesture-based controls, ensuring that everyone can find a suitable playing style. The matches are fast-paced and action-packed, making it ideal for quick gaming sessions on the go, although it's worth nothing that the game strictly requires an internet connection to be able play.\r\nThe two core game modes are VS Attack and Head to Head, which will be very familiar for fans of the previous FIFA Mobile games, as it's basically the same gameplay format entering this new franchise name change. VS attack is a real time indirect battle between your team and the opponents, as both teams rush to score more goals against the defending opposing team controlled by AI. The fast-paced nature of these matches adds an adrenaline rush, and the short duration of each half makes it perfect for quick gaming sessions on the go.\r\nIn contrast, Head to Head is a direct battle between your team and opponents, with both teams competing directly and playing both defense and offense against one another in real time. These modes are playable in either unranked or ranked mode, which are both available in the beta already.\r\nThe core aspect of EA Sports FC Mobile's progression revolves around building a Soccer Team. Players collect player cards through packs, events, and the in-game market. As they acquire more player cards, they can improve their starting lineup and overall team rating.\r\nAs a free-to-play game, EA Sports FC Mobile does incorporate in-app purchases, allowing players to acquire virtual currency or packs for faster progression and acquiring top-rated players. While the store and many of the monetization features such as season passes are currently locked for the beta version, past experiences with the FIFA mobile series have been relatively generous with its free rewards. Still, some players may feel tempted to spend real money to improve their teams. Additionally, quests, leagues, events and campaigns provide varied challenges, rewarding players with unique items and players for their accomplishments (all of which are currently locked or are available in limited form only)\r\nIf you’re wondering why FIFA Mobile is being rebranded to a new franchise called EA Sports FC, It’s because EA Sports and FIFA revealed last year that their long-standing licensing agreement would come to an end on December 31, 2022. Still, this new iteration will retain its extensive collection of football licenses and adopt the same gameplay format, as even more evident with its mobile version, which for all intents and purposes, looks very much similar to last years’ FIFA Mobile but with graphical improvements, reskinned UI, and new name.\r\nFor existing players of FIFA Mobile, the transition to the EA Sports FC version will be seamless. The game will be available as an update on the App Store or Play Store, allowing players to continue their football journey without losing their progress as such as account names and various unlocks and purchases.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6101771?share_id=85b92c5e610f&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

In this game, players take on the role of Xia, an adopted child of the master Wei Yu, who embarks on a quest for revenge after their close friend is betrayed. As the story progresses, Xia uncovers secrets about the past and a powerful force that threatens to destroy everything they hold dear. For those confused, this is different from the upcoming Assassin’s Creed codename Red, which is set in another oriental region, Japan.\r\nCodename Jade is rumored to be released next year, but for now, it is currently conducting a closed beta test for 5,000 lucky players that were selected during a registration phase last July. The closed beta test will last August 3 to 11. Currently, there is no way to access the beta without getting whitelisted, so even  sideloading the APK would not work.\r\nI wasn’t able to get access to the game, fortunately, closed beta test players have begun posting their footage online, and with permission from one of them; youtuber shooothim1991 has granted me permission to share one of his gameplay footage. Special thanks to him!\r\nyoutuber shooothim1991\r\nThe first part showcased the game’s combat, which is highly reminiscent of the last three mainline games in the series. This definitely looks like a cut-and-dry continuation from the same cloth, albeit toned down to fit mobile devices and implemented with touch controls instead. There is no firm information on whether the game will support physical controllers like the Razer Kishi or Xbox wireless controller, but support is highly likely.\r\nThe footage opens into us taking control of master Wei Yu, battling a Roman General which is suspiciously a reused asset from AC: Odyssey, nevertheless the combat system featuring the main character using a Spear still looked quite impressive and right at home as a mobile game.\r\nIt then cuts to Wei Yu talking to a familiar character for Assassin’s Creed fans: Kassandra, who is revealed to be the one we have conducted a deal with. Soon enough, it now takes us to a character creator setting that allows us to select the gender and customize the main character’s looks, including the eyes, nose, mouth, etc., which is a first for the series.\r\nNow, it would not be an Assassin’s Creed game without its iconic stealth and assassination gameplay, and the footage also showcases part of it. The gameplay format is basically the same here, consisting of hiding around rooftops and bushes, and performing takedowns on unsuspecting guards, as well as the iconic exploration and parkour segments. It looks like nothing is toned down here gameplay-wise, and we are essentially getting a full-blown Assassin’s Creed experience for the first time on mobile.\r\nFor those wondering about the price, the good news is that Assassin's Creed Codename Jade is set to be a free-to-play game, adopting the model popular in mobile games. However, there is a bit of worry for me here as free-to-play usually comes synonymous nowadays with gacha gaming and grindy progression. I hope the developers will find the right balance between free-to-play and premium players, resulting in an enjoyable experience for both\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6110637?share_id=f470992170aa&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The vast world, intricate systems, and captivating storytelling that come with the experience of D&D are promised, resonating with long-time fans and newcomers alike.\r\n## Pros\r\n- newcomer friendly, anyone can jump in w/out playing previous games or any D&D experience\r\n- captures the feel of Dungeons & Dragons\r\n- plethora of origins, race, class customization\r\n- story is open-ended and has branching storylines and consequences\r\n- combat is highly tactical\r\n- polished looking graphics\r\n- amazing soundtrack\r\n- smooth experience overall\r\n- well-built and separate UI for both keyboard mouse and controller\r\n- coop multiplayer option with split-screen## Cons\r\n- mechanics can be overwhelming for newcomers\r\nDungeons & Dragons is a seminal tabletop role-playing game that has captured the imaginations of countless players for over four decades. Its influence on video games has been significant and generation defining, but it has experienced highs and lows throughout its history in the digital realm.\r\nThe 1990s saw a golden era for D&D-based video games. Titles like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment not only brought the rich lore and intricate gameplay of D&D to the digital world but also introduced a new generation to the captivating fantasy universe. As gaming technology advanced however, the industry witnessed a shift towards visually stunning and action-packed games. The popularity of D&D-based video games began to wane in the late 2000s as players gravitated towards more graphically intense and fast-paced titles like Diablo, Skyrim, and The Witcher; Although, the influences of D&D can still be felt in basically any RPG video game since.\r\nNow, three years later after Early Access, Baldur’s Gate 3 is officially out on PC, with its release on Playstation scheduled for next month and on Xbox next year. With its official launch, it treats players to an awe-inspiring adventure with a staggering amount of content, freedom, and immersion.\r\nThe world of Baldur's Gate 3 is a grand marvel, meticulously crafted with intricate detail and artistic brilliance, which of course is set in the Forgotten Realms. The art style beautifully blends the familiar D&D aesthetics with a touch of realism and is represented by AAA-level graphics, creating a captivating and enchanting experience for players. The soundtrack is nothing short of amazing as well, featuring a beautiful and memorable high fantasy orchestra that strikes players in the right moments, resulting in a masterpiece of an overall experience in the art department.\r\nThe narrative of Baldur's Gate 3 is a gripping tale of eldritch horrors and dangerous quests, woven with deep lore and emotional depth. The game's grand opening sets the stage for an epic adventure. The plot unfolds organically, guided by players' choices, which often lead to profound consequences. Baldur's Gate 3 features a cast of fully voiced characters, each with a unique personality, background, and motivations, immersing players in a world teeming with life and personality.\r\nNewcomers to the series can jump into Baldur's Gate 3 without any prior knowledge of the previous games and still enjoy the experience.\r\nThe game provides enough context and information to understand the setting, characters, and events within the game world. While it shares the same universe and is set in the iconic Forgotten Realms, the storyline and events in Baldur's Gate 3 are independent and do not directly continue the narrative from the previous games.\r\nThe core cast of characters are all available to be selected as a main character, but players can also opt to create their own custom one with its own defined race, class, sub-class, and traits. The core characters that were not selected will become NPCs and companions in the game’s story, with their own stories unfolding along with the player, as well as the chance to die, depending on the choices of the player. The story is open-ended, not as open-ended as a true D&D game, but nonetheless a pretty authentic crafted experience for players that the developers are boasting to have over 17,000 possible endings and 174 hours of cutscenes.\r\nThe companions in the game are particularly well-developed, eliciting genuine connections with the players. Each companion brings a distinct flavor to the party, sparking lively interactions and creating memorable moments throughout the journey, as well as having their own plot and questlines. The exceptional voice acting breathes life into these characters, enhancing the emotional impact of their stories. Not to mention, the whole campaign is narrated as well by an exceptional voice actor that does the role justice.\r\nBaldur's Gate 3's gameplay is a masterful blend of classic RPG mechanics and innovative design. The game faithfully follows the D&D 5th Edition rules, featuring a plethora of numbers and systems that enrich the experience. Character creation is extensive, offering numerous options for races, classes, backgrounds, and customization, enabling players to shape their avatars to match their playstyle and vision. The D&D 5th Edition ruleset governs the character statistics, skills, spellcasting, and combat mechanics, which will feel right at home to players familiar with the tabletop game.\r\nThe turn-based combat system is strategic and tactical, encouraging players to think critically and plan their moves wisely. Environmental interactions, elemental spells, dice rolls, and dynamic physics add depth to battles, allowing players to use their creativity to overcome challenges. While the game slowly introduces the player in its mechanics, the can be a bit too much for newcomers, as there is too much going on with the mechanics; there’s so many spells and skills to choose from and use. There’s so much going on with the different conditions, reactions, and modifiers involved in both the combat and skill-checked dialogue encounters.\r\nBaldur's Gate 3 boasts an astonishing amount of quests and side content, and players will never be short of engaging activities. Quests are designed to flow organically into one another and feature multiple solutions and branching paths, encouraging players to experiment and approach challenges in creative ways. Characters can die or not die, friends can become foe or neutral, and rewards will vary from one decision to another.\r\nDialogues are an integral part of the game, and players can engage in conversations with NPCs using branching dialogue options. Role-playing is encouraged, allowing players to shape their character's personality and moral alignment, as well as utilize their skills and traits to influence the outcome of dice rolls. Saving is allowed at almost any point in the game, enabling players to test this system to its limits. However, I wouldn’t recommend this so-called \"save scumming\" and suggest embracing the consequences of your choices instead.\r\nThroughout the game, players could collect loot from defeated enemies and discover valuable items in the world, and trade it with vendors around the world. Crafting and alchemy is a feature, allowing players to create new items and equipment from collected resources. Each character will have their own equipment that players can customize to their benefit and enhance their capabilities.\r\nThe open-world design also rewards exploration, as hidden treasures, secret areas, and memorable encounters await those who dare to venture off the beaten path. As far as the environment goes, players could use their characters' skills and spells to manipulate the environment, find hidden passages, or create tactical advantages in combat. Characters can also use minor but useful commands such as jump, shove, dip, and telekinesis; to navigate and utilize the environment.\r\nBaldur's Gate 3 also supports both keyboard/mouse and controller inputs, each with significantly different UI elements depending on the input method used. The keyboard/mouse setup relies on the traditional point-and-click approach, presenting players with an overwhelming selection of choices and information in the skill bar. On the other hand, the controller scheme focuses on radial menus and organic player control using the left stick.\r\nBoth input methods are equally viable, but I felt that the controller support is better suited for newcomers to the genre, as it doesn't overwhelm players with a plethora of visual elements right from the beginning. However, once you become familiar with the complexities and intricacies of the game, you'll find the keyboard/mouse layout much more superior and faster to use, albeit at the expense of comfort.\r\nBaldur's Gate 3’s multiplayer component is primarily designed as a cooperative experience, allowing players to team up with friends for an unforgettable co-op adventure. Players can invite friends to their session and have them control any of their companions. For those groups of players looking to take co-op to another level by regularly playing and finishing the campaign together, they can also start a campaign and each of them create their own custom character. However, the progression is still tied to the game’s host player. Gameplay wise, characters are not obligated to stay near each other or take the same actions, allowing for individual exploration. In dialogue interactions, if one character initiates a conversation, others can suggest choices, with the host ultimately deciding.\r\nPerformance wise, it ran satisfactory relative to my hardware. (i7-8700k, 32GB, RTX 3080) Never really experiencing slowdowns or stutters during my playthrough. It is also Verified for the Steam Deck, and in my testing reaches an FPS range of 30fps at its lowest, while reaching as far as 60fps. It really is a well-rounded polished experience overall. My only gripe is the abhorrent out-of-place game launcher to start the game, which can fortunately be turned off in Steam’s game launch options.\r\nWhile some players might find the complexities of the game overwhelming, those who embrace them are rewarded with a rich and unforgettable adventure through the Forgotten Realms. The impressive translation of D&D mechanics, exceptional character development, immersive world design, and remarkable quest variety make Baldur's Gate 3 a must-buy for any player who loves RPG games. Even those who normally wouldn’t like turn-based RPG games, I’d still recommend it to them. Dungeons & Dragons in video games has come full circle, from its humble beginnings in text-based RPGs to its resurgence with Baldur's Gate 3.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6109877?share_id=2362efd59f3f&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Now, three years later, Baldur’s Gate 3 is officially out on PC.\r\nThe game allows players to create their protagonist from a selection of different races, classes, and backgrounds. Players can choose from various races such as humans, elves, dwarves, and tieflings, among others, and different classes like fighter, wizard, cleric, rogue, and ranger. Character choices influences abilities, skills, and unique dialogue options throughout the game.\r\nAside from a custom character, the initial core cast of characters are also all available to be selected as a main character.

The developers, Larian Studios, were praised for their commitment to staying true to the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset and the authentic role-playing experience they delivered. Personally, I enjoyed the depth of character creation, the interactive storytelling with varying outcomes, skill-checked dialogues, and the deep strategic turn-based combat.\r\n[Original link](https://m.taptap.io/post/6109838?share_id=261f666a0c5a&utm_medium=share&utm_source=discord) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Overwatch Mobile\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nGet\r\nOverwatch 2: Invasion introduces a series of story missions that expand upon the narrative universe of Overwatch 2. These missions focus on the invasion of Null Sector, a rogue Omnic group, and the heroes' efforts to combat this threat and restore order. The missions are designed to immerse players in dynamic PvE scenarios that delve deeper into the game's lore and offer engaging cooperative gameplay experiences.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A refreshing coop PvE gameplay\r\n- New PvP gamemode “Flashpoint”\r\n- Compelling cinematic narrative\r\n- Well-crafted intense cutscenes## Cons\r\n-Short runtime (1-2 hrs)\r\n-Huge departure from the original free-to-play PvE campaign\r\nIn Overwatch 2: Invasion, the spotlight shines on the much-discussed story missions and the controversy surrounding the change in the game’s direction. Invasion offers a departure from the usual PvP (Player vs. Player) dynamics, these PvE (Player vs. Environment) missions immerse players in intense, city-spanning battles against the rogue Omnic group, Null Sector. From the chilling Toronto subway mission to the urban chaos of Rio de Janeiro and Gothenburg, each scenario is meticulously designed, providing a cinematic coop PvE experience.\r\nThe $15 bundle includes access to the Story Missions during the season and permanently thereafter, along with 1,000 Overwatch Coins, a new Legendary skin for Sojourn, and permanent access to Sojourn as a playable hero upon completing Story Mission challenges. For those seeking an even more comprehensive experience, the Overwatch 2: Ultimate Invasion Bundle is available for $40. This bundle includes all the content of the Invasion Bundle, as well as additional bonuses like the Null Sector Premium Battle Pass with 20 Battle Pass skips, an extra 1,000 Overwatch Coins, and two legendary skins for Cassidy and Kiriko.\r\nTo go along with the release of the DLC is the game’s official release on Steam — a first for Blizzard games, following a surprise announcement last month. With the declining player engagement in Overwatch 2 and the impending Microsoft acquisition, it seems that Blizzard is looking to diversify its distribution channels and reach a wider audience.\r\nOverwatch 2: Invasion crafts a compelling narrative that sees Null Sector launching a global assault, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The story missions bring this crisis to life, exposing players to impactful moments and emotional storytelling. The DLC features three missions across three cities, and the missions take around ten to twenty minutes each, depending on which of the four difficulty settings you select.\r\nBlizzard's commitment to storytelling, art style, and sound design remains evident. Environments brim with charm, vividly capturing the stylized chaos and beauty of each locale. The voice acting and music elevate the emotional resonance of the narrative. When you’re not in-game playing, the cutscenes  are amazing and reminded me of the classic Overwatch animated shorts that we used to get back in the heydays of the original Overwatch.\r\nAside from the PvE story missions, we also get the Flashpoint PvP mode that introduces a refreshing take on competitive gameplay. The tactical skirmishes for control points engage players' strategic thinking, propelling the franchise into exciting new territory. Hero Mastery training and the revamped Practice Range cater to those dedicated to honing their skills. However, while these new elements shine, the decision to shift away from the initial PvE vision and introduce individual DLC packs raises eyebrows.\r\nDespite all of this content, controversy looms over Overwatch 2: Invasion due to shifts in design choices and monetization strategies. The departure from the initial free-to-play PvE vision, including the planned campaign mode, followed by the subsequent transition to a paid, scaled-down PvE content with its Story Missions, has raised concerns about the franchise's direction and the delicate balance between creative integrity and financial gain. This isn’t the content that was originally promised.\r\nWith all its merits, a question emerges: is this experience worth the $15 price tag of the Overwatch 2: Invasion bundle? The action-packed cooperative story, narrative depth, and gripping emotional engagement can't be overlooked, but the financial value remains a subject of contention. One could argue the 1000 Overwatch coins it brings is alone worth the price of admission. However, factoring in the departure from the initial free-to-play PvE vision and the shift towards individual paid DLC packs, are controversial elements that have left a sour taste in the mouths of many fans.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6127368) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical\r\nGraphics & Music\r\nStray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical fuses urban fantasy, Greek mythology, and musical elements into a captivating experience that resonates with both the heart and the senses.\r\n## Pros\r\n- captivating hand-drawn cartoon art style\r\n- impressive voice acting, both for the dialogue and songs\r\n- engaging narrative that explores themes of life, loss, and the unknown\r\n- branching paths and choices that matter\r\n- the interactive gameplay is blended with musical aspect very well\r\n## Cons\r\n- slow pacing\r\n- sound mixing is questionable\r\n- save file and performance issues\r\nIn Stray Gods, players embark on a journey as Grace, an aspiring musician who unexpectedly inherits the powers of the Last Muse, due to an unexpected circumstance. Set in an urban fantasy world where myths and monsters intertwine with normal, modern life, Grace becomes entangled in a murder mystery that demands her musical prowess – enhanced by the powers of the Gods. The player's choices shape Grace's path as she navigates the intricacies of Greek deities, uncovers dark secrets, and harmonizes her way to justice.\r\nStray Gods embraces a captivating hand-drawn art style that resembles animated cartoons, effectively immersing players in its fantastical world that oddly reminds me of the game Hades in both the art direction and the greek-inspired characters. While not extensively animated and more like a slideshow of storyboard elements, the visuals offer scene-setting backdrops, subtle storytelling through animated moments, and an alluring comic-book aesthetic that enhances the overall experience. The art direction evokes a balance between the mythical and the contemporary, beautifully complementing the game's urban fantasy theme. However, at times, I find myself wishing that the character mouths were a bit more animated and lively, especially that the core elements of this game are in the dialogue and the songs.\r\nStray Gods challenges the conventional definition of gameplay, the pacing might be a bit slower than I had preferred, but nevertheless it offers an interactive narrative experience that explores themes of life, loss, and the unknown, and is entirely driven by player choices — similar to games like The Wolf Among Us or As Dusk Falls. These choices are seamlessly blended with and are infused by the musical aspect, allowing players to shape the story through their decisions and even influence song lyrics and melodies. This unique approach transforms the game into an musical adventure, where players guide Grace's path through the power of music. While it may not align with traditional RPG games and look more like an interactive movie, the game's engaging narrative and innovative interactions create a wholly distinct gameplay experience.\r\nStray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical provides players with three distinct options to shape their own path through both the music and the story: Charming, Kickass, and Clever. The personality you select will determine a unique path with its own set of choices within the game.\r\nEven if you decide to opt for a different personality in subsequent playthroughs, the choices associated with the unselected personalities remain visible, albeit greyed out. This feature can encourage players to embark on multiple playthroughs to see the outcomes of these greyed out choices, enhancing replay value a little bit.\r\nThere are also moments of investigation, but instead of the usual point-and-click adventure gameplay where players need to click on certain points of interest on the environment to investigate them, the process here is much more simplified and just presents the players with all the possible options from the get go.\r\nBehind Stray Gods' interactivity lies exceptional character development and impressive voice acting, both for the dialogue and the actual songs. The diverse cast of characters is expertly brought to life by a star-studded ensemble of voice actors, including Laura Bailey, Troy Baker, and Ashley Johnson — the biggest names in the video game voice acting industry. These talents infuse emotion, depth, and authenticity into each character, captivating players with their performances. My only gripe is the actual sound mixing, in which the actual dialogues aren’t properly balanced with each other, some dialogues will suddenly jump up or down in volume, and some songs will sound raw and dialogue-like instead of the usual studio produced sounding output.\r\nThe incorporation of music as a central gameplay element sets Stray Gods apart from its contemporaries. The interactive and time-limited song choices, where players shape the direction of the music, provide an engaging layer to the narrative. This innovation transforms the game into a harmonious experience, making each playthrough distinct and personalized. While the music might not be groundbreaking, its role in storytelling and player agency deserves recognition.\r\nStray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical is an unorthodox gem that marries urban fantasy, Greek mythology, and musical storytelling into a harmonious journey that will take players around more or less six hours to complete. While it challenges traditional gaming norms, its innovative narrative and artistic execution offer a fresh perspective on interactive experiences. An exceptional addition to the interactive storytelling genre, resonating with those who appreciate both musicality and immersive narratives.\r\nIn terms of technical performance, despite the game's light 2D graphics and relatively simple gameplay, I actually experienced some slowdowns, particularly during scene outcome transitions after the players have chosen a decision. Speaking of transitions, skipping lines doesn't work really well either and skips more than a few lines each instead of just one at a time to speed up the dialogue, there's no viewable conversation history to help as well.\r\nThere are also reports from other players about crashes and loss of saved file progress. I've personally experienced the latter issue as well. So, for those who are considering jumping in early, be cautious for now until the patches expected to hopefully address these concerns are out.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6136708) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It was globally released for iOS, Android, and PC last August 1. Developed by Netmarble, the same studio behind the renowned RPG game Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross, even though they both Grand Cross in their names, the games are not connected storywise\r\n## Pros\r\n- Interesting story and unique meta-commentary of the self-aware main character\r\n- Refreshing blend of anime and city-building\r\n- Detailed presentation\r\n- Simple and easy to understand gameplay and mechanics\r\n- Supports multi-languages## Cons\r\n- There might be too much dialogue, cutscenes, and tutorial\r\n- Requires a lot of real-world waiting\r\n- Heavy pay to win mechanics\r\nSet in the fantastical world of Skyna, Grand Cross: Age of Titans centers around the characters Mio and Eugene. Mio is an idol on the cusp of her debut, and Eugene is a video game genius who realizes the game's virtual nature immediately after being summoned. The duo is unexpectedly sent to Skyna, a kingdom under threat from invading forces of Chaos. With Princess Destina by their side, Mio and Eugene become unlikely saviors, leading various types of troops in their quest to retake territories lost to the forces of Chaos.\r\nThe game boasts an anime art style that is pleasing to the eyes and vibrantly designed. The anime artstyle contributes to a captivating atmosphere that draws players into the game's interesting narrative.  The story is quite engaging, the presentation features well thought out still-panel cutscenes and dialogues.\r\nNotably, these dialogues are fully voiced in three languages: English, Japanese, and Korean. However, the cutscenes and dialogues might be too much for people who just want to play the game, and the main character is even self-aware of this element. Fortunately they are mostly skippable, with even a slight summary of what is to be skipped.\r\nGrand Cross: Age of Titans introduces an intriguing twist to the Isekai formula by blending it with city-building MMORTS gameplay. The game starts off feeling like a RPG gacha game, with all the isekai, anime, and waifu elements you’d normally see in a RPG game, but in actuality it is a city-builder strategy game extremely similar to Rise of Kingdoms, with the option to venture out in the MMORTS-esque overworld map, explore, mine resources, attack monsters, and team-up or clash against other cities.\r\nThe main hero is self-aware that he is in a video game, and explains the mechanics himself to the player, this contrasts with the supporting character who, in turn, remains clueless about the in-game world and mirrors the player’s cluelessness, creating a refreshing departure from the conventional approach and providing some unique meta-commentary aspects. The tutorial takes a lot of time explaining all the mechanics, it can take around 30 minutes for the basic explanation, and more hours to explain the deeper mechanics, especially when the wait for upgrade becomes longer.\r\nThe city-building aspect of Grand Cross: Age of Titans is the main component of the gameplay. Buildings must be constructed and upgraded, and the waiting is in real-time. This waiting period which will take from mere seconds during early game to even hours and days in late game, can be expedited using boosts, particularly through in-app purchases. Structures will feature branching prerequisites with one another, ultimately leading to the Main Castle level which serves as the central component of the city-building mechanics.\r\nThe potential impact of wait times on players who choose different paths—free-to-play versus boosting through in-game mechanisms—is worth considering, although in my experience in the early parts of the game, players are given plenty of boosts to jumpstart and skip many waiting times of upgrades, the issue arises when the game is played competitively, as to which the glaring issues about the pay to win aspect will be evident against players who opted to spend lots of money.\r\nIn addition to the single player story chapters, territory expansion, and open-world exploration, Grand Cross: Age of Titans also offers multiplayer modes. Modes such as Castle War, Server vs. Server War, and Territory Expansion allows guild-esque alliances and intense, large-scale battles across the open-world map.\r\nTitans, massive battle units resembling mechas, introduces a strategic dynamic that can turn the tide of battles. These Titans possess the ability to navigate any terrain and unleash devastating damage, making them pivotal assets in conflicts.\r\nThe streamlined mechanics and simplified resource management contribute to accessibility without sacrificing strategic depth. Players manage three resources — of which you are given an abundant amount in the early game and via tasks like missions — plus a single premium currency, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the economy. The transition between battles, world exploration, and city building is seamless and enriches the overall experience, even offering players the ability to turn down the visuals for the overworld, if things get too crowded and resource intensive.\r\nHowever, the game is still in dire need of more quality of life features. For example, every single building upgrade or troop recruit that you do aren’t automatically completed, you still need to click to confirm for each and every one of them, making the process a bit tedious when you’re trying to do multiple tasks consecutively and simultaneously.\r\nAnd of course, there is an inclusion of gacha mechanics, in the form of acquiring hero characters capable of leading armies. Heroes can undergo upgrades by enhancing their level, star level, talents, and skills. Levels serve as the foundational statistic for upgrades. Moreover, the star level can be upgraded as the hero's level reaches a specific threshold. With this rating increase, heroes unlock new skills and gain the ability to select additional talents from the talent tree. The armies these heroes can lead encompass an array of troop types, encompassing infantry, archers, cavalry, and siege weapons, and can be recruited through various buildings in the players’ city.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6135382) Originally posted on TapTap.",

However, this newfound prosperity faces a dire threat from an enigmatic alien civilization with the power to mimic human attributes and abilities. Dubbed the \"Protectors\" initiative, players are tasked with countering this formidable foe to safeguard humanity's future. — Typical hero shooter premise, however the story isn't the focal point, even the characters lack full voiceovers, especially in the roughly 15 minute tutorial where everything must be read by the player.\r\nVisually, the game adopts a stylized cartoon 3D art style that contributes to its approachable and accessible nature. The graphics are clean, vibrant, and the overall art direction feels cohesive, keeping the interface slick and easy to navigate. Although there aren't overly complex visual elements, the game's aesthetic serves its purpose well, creating an immersive environment for fast-paced shooting battles, similar to games like Overwatch, or Valorant.\r\nThe gameplay itself maintains a simplicity that aligns with the bite-sized nature of the matches. There is an auto-aim that adds a level of accessibility, particularly reminiscent of console shooters like Halo, which helps players focus on the action without being bogged down by intricate aiming. Matches are designed to be quick, lasting between one to two minutes, making it ideal for both quick on-the-go sessions and low-stress competitive gaming.\r\nWhile the absence of certain traditional mechanics like jumping, crouching, and taking cover feels barebones and limits the depth for players seeking a more intricate approach, it nonetheless harmonizes well with the game's fast-paced nature. Each character is equipped with a single unique skill, which enhances the game's bite-sized orientation. However, for those accustomed to games with deep mechanics and high skill ceiling, this is a bit lacking.\r\nProgression in Protectors: Shooter Legends introduces a stamina / energy system that limits continuous play, although it replenishes over time. The game also employs familiar elements like loot boxes, cosmetics, battle passes, and premium characters with their own distinct skills and weapon types, giving the option to spend real money to further unlock and customize their characters.\r\nThe game's controls offer three different schemes to accommodate different play styles: auto-fire, auto-fire with manual shooting, and purely manual shooting. An accessibility option that allows players to choose a control scheme that suits their comfort level. However, I find the non-customizable fixed button placements very limiting, and doesn’t really offer much accessibility especially for players who have gotten used to their own personal configurations in other mobile shooter games.\r\nThe ability to choose a preferred game mode will unlock as players progress through the game. However, it's important to note that the advertised PvP gameplay is primarily asynchronous, as players are only pitted against AI bots rather than live opponents. The only PvP aspect is the League leaderboards.\r\nIn terms of performance, the game allows up to 90 fps, which is a neat feature for those who come equipped with screens above 60hz. However, it's worth mentioning that the game suffers from random lagging issues even with my Snapdragon 888 device, which can be a bit frustrating and disrupt the overall experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6143548) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game thrusts players into a dystopian future where advanced technology and chaos converge.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Intense Combat\r\n- Extremely responsive controls and movement system\r\n- Amazing art direction and overall visuals\r\n- A world that feels nostalgic, modern, and futuristic all at the same time\r\n- Huge arsenal of weapons and upgrades\r\n- Rewards exploration and is filled with secrets## Cons\r\n- Confusing level design\r\n- Generic, forgettable story\r\nIn a world where mainstream first-person shooters are now focused on hyper-realism, aim down sight mechanics, and the battle royale format, a distinct shift is taking place. Slowly emerging in a small corner of the industry is a haven for those who grew up in the 90s playing FPS games – what we now commonly refer to as \"boomer shooter\" games.\r\nFollowing the footsteps of and spearheaded by the last AAA boomer shooter standing, Doom: Eternal, plus indie games like the similarly titled Ultrakill, and Metal: Hellsinger, Turbo Overkill emerges as another entry that pays homage to classic titles while carving its own distinct identity. Developed by Apogee, this cyberpunk-fueled FPS catapults players into a world where augmentation and mayhem intertwine.\r\nDespite the retro looking graphics, Turbo Overkill still amazed me with its art direction and overall visuals. The 90s PC gaming aesthetics, complete with pixelated textures and low-poly models, evoke a nostalgic sensation while integrating seamlessly with modern graphical marvels like modern lighting, effects, and physics. The result is a world that feels nostalgic, modern, and futuristic all at the same time. The neon-soaked streets of Paradise, with towering megacorporation buildings, deliver an authentic cyberpunk atmosphere that captures the essence of the genre.\r\nWhile not in the realm of winning awards in terms of storytelling, Turbo Overkill weaves a narrative that feels right at home within the boomer shooter genre. As Johnny Turbo, players embark on a mission to save Paradise from the grip of the rogue AI SYN. The story delves into themes of greed and power, adding depth to the neon-lit dystopia.\r\nAt its heart, Turbo Overkill delivers a gameplay experience that's as exhilarating as it is intense. The movement system, featuring sliding, dashing, and wall-running, adds a dynamic verticality that complements the fast-paced combat. The controls are extremely responsive, moving the character is such a blast, and It felt like I was in complete control 100% of the time.\r\nThe arsenal of weapons, each with its own unique fire modes and modifiable upgrades, caters to a variety of playstyles and all have their own degrees of awesomeness.  Boss fights are dynamic and engaging, with evolving phases and well-integrated enemy waves that offer moments of respite amidst the chaos.\r\nHowever, the true highlight is Johnny Turbo's signature chainsaw leg—a visceral slide-based melee weapon that's not only a lethal tool of destruction but a crucial source of healing and armor generation, depending on which augment you’ll slap in your character.  Other augments are also available in game that gives the players enhances the player's overall move set and mobility.\r\nThe combat system is done so well that I couldn’t care less about the story and other mechanics anymore. It's a high-stakes dance of precision, evasion, and controlled chaos. The relentless pace ensures players are always on their toes, whether players are mowing down enemies with his leg mounted chainsaw or entering slo-mo with Turbo Time, every tool at Johnny's disposal contributes to an adrenaline-fueled experience that keeps players engaged from start to finish.\r\nAside from its crucial role in combat, the game rewards mastery of movement and strategy even further via platforming elements and secret areas. The wide, multi-level structures of the environments offer abundant opportunities to utilize Johnny's mobility options and reveal hidden treasures. The benefits of thorough exploration extend beyond just achievements, extending to gameplay modifiers and secret levels that contribute to replay value and depth within the experience. However, it's not without its downsides; occasionally, the level design becomes outright confusing, leaving players like myself lost for a good minute or two, or perhaps even longer. This flaw occasionally affects the game's otherwise fast-paced nature.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6144701) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Turbo Overkill is a high-octane first-person shooter that blends the intense bullet-hell and high speed action of retro titles like Doom and Quake with a cyberpunk aesthetic. The game thrusts players into a dystopian future where advanced technology and chaos converge.\r\nThe game's strengths are evident, with its intense combat system that demands precision and strategy. The controls are incredibly responsive, enabling players to master movement and maneuverability and feel 100% in control at all times. The art direction and visuals are impression, as the pixelated textures and low-poly models blend seamlessly with contemporary lighting and effects, resulting in a world that feels nostalgic, modern, and futuristic all at the same time.\r\nThe narrative, while not groundbreaking, aligns well with the boomer shooter genre as players step into the role of Johnny Turbo to save Paradise from the grip of the rogue AI SYN. I can see why it's currently taking the gaming community by storm, more specifically with its Steam’s overwhelmingly positive ratings.  This game is indeed something special, paying homage to classic titles while carving its own distinct identity.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6144649) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "In a surprising departure from the series' established norm of being known for its renowned fighting games, BlazBlue Entropy Effect boldly ventures into uncharted territory with its unique take on the roguelite genre, albeit a bit strangely done.\r\nAt the core of BlazBlue Entropy Effect lies an addictive gameplay loop that seamlessly intertwines side-scrolling action with the exploratory nature of Metroidvania games. The game features four meticulously designed level types—Night City, Ruins, Research Base, and Sakura City—each presenting distinct challenges, bosses, and enemy types to conquer.\r\nThe character roster, featuring seven BlazBlue characters: Ragna, Hibiki, Mai, Hakumen, Noel, Kokonoe, and Λ-No.11, with one more slated as coming soon. Each of the characters have their own movesets and weapons that range from swords, spears, to even guns. And I found all of the movesets awesome and fun to use. The combat mechanics, although not flawlessly fluid, deliver impactful blows that empower players to engage effectively. This impact, coupled with a carefully maintained balance between challenging boss encounters and regular enemy confrontations, ensures that players remain invested and motivated to hone their skills.\r\nThe progression is a typical roguelite setup of random upgrades and choices every area clear, and is sprinkled with novel mechanics to spice up the roguelite experience. The story is a bit nonsensical, and doesn't really mesh the Blazblue and roguelite premise very well. However, you can just easily ignore it in exchange for the exceptional combat gameplay.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6149501) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Burst Space\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nBurst Space is a retro-style Roguelite top down shooter that puts players into a pixelated sci-fi universe inhabited by a cast of endearing warrior waifu girls known as Einherjar, the game promises an engaging blend of accessible gameplay and strategic depth with its roguelite gameplay and progression system.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Experimentation and Customization\r\n- Engaging progression\r\n- Unique boss encounters\r\n- Waifu Einherjar characters\r\n## Cons\r\n- Poor translation\r\n- Server connection problems\r\n- Performance issues\r\n- Always online feature\r\nReleased on Android, currently only for the Philippines region, Burst Space introduces players to intense bullet-hell like battles, abilities experimentation, and the opportunity to collect and customize their waifu Einherjar warriors. The visual allure of Burst Space lies in its nostalgic and simple pixel art style, a fusion of retro charm and contemporary design. Resulting in a visually adequate and enjoyable experience that appeals to both pixel art enthusiasts and those new to the style.\r\nThe overarching objective is to rescue the Einherjar from each planet and harness their power to conquer bosses, unlock equipment, and further enhance the characters' skills and abilities. Burst Space also features free-to-play elements like battle passes, events, and premium Einherjar, offering players the option to personalize and extend their gameplay experience using the power of real money.\r\nBurst Space's gameplay mechanics are balanced to provide accessibility without sacrificing strategic depth. The automatic aiming system simplifies combat by allowing players to focus on tactics rather than precise aiming — although there is still an option to toggle manual aiming for those who dare.\r\nBy holding down the fire button, the character automatically targets enemies, making battles smooth and engaging. This design choice ensures that even players unfamiliar with the roguelite genre can jump in and enjoy the action. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean Burst Space isn't a complex game. Players will still need to dodge, use skill abilities, and summon Einherjar companions to conquer the battlefield.\r\nAdditionally, the roguelite aspect brings a randomized element to the gameplay through bonus modifiers. These modifiers offer unique effects under specific conditions, encouraging players to adapt their tactics based on the modifiers encountered. This balance between accessibility and depth makes Burst Space an inviting experience for both newcomers and experienced players.\r\nAt its core, Burst Space thrives on experimentation and customization. While not as intricate as some of its roguelite counterparts, the game encourages players to explore various skills, abilities, and upgrades to optimize their approach.  Burst Space embraces player creativity by offering a multitude of choices, especially in longer levels where there are more choices, ensuring that the gameplay experience remains engaging and dynamic. The depth of gameplay isn't solely confined to individual runs though, as the character's true power level lies in the progression system outside of battles.\r\nLevel Progression in Burst Space is centered around the player's quest to rescue Einherjar across twelve planets. Each planet presents its own unique aesthetic and challenges, culminating in a challenging boss encounter. As players advance through the levels, they acquire equipment, weapons, and accessories, adding more Einherjar to the available roster. Skill customization and weapon mastery upgrades contribute to character growth, allowing for personalized play styles and strategies. Burst Space's progression system strikes a balance between depth and accessibility, providing a rewarding sense of advancement and mastery.\r\nHowever, Burst Space is not without its drawbacks. The game is poorly translated to English, potentially detracting from the game's overall charm. Additionally, persistent server connection problems and stutters can disrupt even the simplest tasks as basic as upgrading something, or even just navigating the menu, impeding the flow of the game potentially causing frustration among players — considering the game is always online and not playable offline. In addition, even with the game's retro graphics, it still suffers from occasional performance issues even with a Snapdragon 888 device.\r\nAs with its free-to-play elements like battle passes, events, quests, and premium Einherjar, Burst Space offers players the opportunity to enhance and personalize their gaming experience. There is also an option to use ads to force additional rolls, for example in reroll the selection of ability bonuses during runs. While these elements can extend the longevity of the game, it's important to note that they come with the option to spend real money. This approach to monetization might not resonate with all players, potentially affecting their overall enjoyment of the game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6148803) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Hammerwatch II\r\nHammerwatch II is a retro-style action RPG developed by Crackshell. Serving as a direct sequel to the original Hammerwatch, the game offers a rich and nostalgic experience that delves into the heart of pixelated dungeon exploration and intense combat encounters.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Nostalgic pixel art\r\n- Engaging hack and slash combat\r\n- Huge dungeons and maps to get lost in\r\n- Overwhelming amount of quests## Cons\r\n- No split-screen/shared screen, unlike the first game\r\n- Co-op progression / savefile is tied to the host only, making co-op play inconvenient\r\n- Technical issues such as broken controller support and intermittent stutters\r\nReleased as a follow-up to the successful roguelite Heroes of Hammerwatch, this title returns to the franchise's hack and slash roots and directly follows the story and gameplay of the first Hammerwatch game. Players are transported to a fantastical realm where they must aid King Roland's resistance efforts while navigating a world teeming with danger, quests, and opportunities for character growth.\r\nThe pixel art aesthetic that defines Hammerwatch II serves as an inviting path into a retro crafted world. This pixel-perfect design encapsulates both the nostalgia of classic gaming and infused with modern gameplay mechanics such as skill upgrades, leveling systems, and item and equipment looting. From lush forests to foreboding dungeons, each location is expansive with huge maps to explore and secret locations to uncover.\r\nHammerwatch II features a simplistic classic Zelda-like combat system, where players must master a diverse cast of character classes including the Wizard, Paladin, Rogue, Warlock, and Ranger. The array of available classes offers varying approaches to combat, catering to different playstyles and preferences. Instead of being point and click like Diablo, the character is directly controlled using the WASD and aiming is done via mouse.\r\nFor its controller scheme, it functions similarly to a twin stick shooter, especially when using ranged classes. Characters in total have one movement ability, one basic attack, one defensive and offensive skill to use, forming the basic core of the combat.\r\nHammerwatch II features intense battles as players navigate hordes of enemies, unleash devastating spells, and strategically time attacks to emerge victorious. The mastery progression system for upgrading the skills of the heroes and attribute system further deepens the experience, enabling players to refine their characters' abilities and tailor their skills to suit their unique strategies.\r\nThe game features a very expansive world with intricate dungeons. From the initial settlement, players embark on an overwhelming amount of quests that take them deeper into the realm, ultimately leading to getting lost in colossal dungeons brimming with secrets and challenges, sometimes for lack of direction. Navigating the game's world and dungeons isn't as flawless performance wise, as I’ve experienced random stutters in the gameplay experience can momentarily disrupt immersion, and I hope this could get patched up soon.\r\nThe controller support requires joystick control of a cursor to navigate menus at times, and I’ve experienced it becoming completely unresponsive intermittently. This has forced me to resort to using a mouse and keyboard for the time being, which, in all honesty, works exceptionally well and is likely the superior way to play the game.\r\nJust like the first game, Hammerwatch II is proud of being designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing players to band together and basically double or quadruple the fun. However, UNLIKE the first game, Hammerwatch II does not feature shared/split-screen, which is an unfortunate design decision that is further exacerbated by the next issue, which is how save files work in co-op sessions.\r\nSave data is tied to the host player's computer rather than the individual participant's, which makes playing the game cooperative with random people a hassle. Even with friends, the data is tied to the host, so players will not be able to continue their progression without the host player. This save file style is commonly used for split-screen/shared screen games such as It Takes Two and Overcooked, so it is definitely a strange decision that was overall met with negative responses from other early players.\r\nHammerwatch II stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of pixel art aesthetics and classic dungeon-crawling gameplay. While the game excels in delivering captivating retro visuals, engaging hack and slash combat, and an easy to understand progression system rooted in character mastery, it's crucial to address the quirks that occasionally disrupt the experience such as broken controller support and save file concerns.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6150690) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Released on Steam in Early Access, this game invites players into a world where the beloved BlazBlue characters meet the dynamic mechanics of a Roguelite adventure.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Gorgeous 2D visuals and lighting system\r\n- Addictive roguelite gameplay loop\r\n- Seven distinct character with their own movesets, skills, and playstyles\r\n- Unique roguelite mechanics## Cons\r\n- Story is nonsensical\r\n## 📝Notable points: These pros and cons are based on Early Access build and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product\r\nIn a surprising departure from the series' established norm of being known for its renowned fighting games, BlazBlue Entropy Effect boldly ventures into uncharted territory with its unique take on the roguelite genre, albeit a bit strangely done (more on that later).\r\nBlazBlue Entropy Effect treats players with a visual splendor that marries the franchise's signature anime-inspired aesthetics with a distinctive and gorgeous paint-like art style. Drawing players into its intricately designed world, the game showcases meticulous attention to detail that translates into vibrant colors, striking character designs, and immersive environments, all complemented by impressive lighting that shines beautifully even on the characters sprites themselves. The animations are equally fluid and smooth, contributing to an overall gameplay and combat system that is seamless and dynamic.\r\nAt the core of BlazBlue Entropy Effect lies an addictive gameplay loop that seamlessly intertwines side-scrolling action with the exploratory nature of Metroidvania games. The game features four meticulously designed level types—Night City, Ruins, Research Base, and Sakura City—each presenting distinct challenges, bosses, and enemy types to conquer.\r\nWhile BlazBlue Entropy Effect may not achieve the pinnacle of combat fluidity found in titles like Hades, Hollow Knight, or Dead Cells, it still is smooth and compensates with its own distinct sense of empowerment and engagement. The character roster features seven BlazBlue characters: Ragna, Hibiki, Mai, Hakumen, Noel, Kokonoe, and Λ-No.11, with one more slated as coming soon.\r\nEach of the characters have their own movesets and weapons that range from swords, spears, to even guns. And I found all of the movesets awesome and fun to use. The combat mechanics, although not flawlessly fluid, deliver impactful blows that empower players to engage effectively. This impact, coupled with a carefully maintained balance between challenging boss encounters and regular enemy confrontations, ensures that players remain invested and motivated to hone their skills.\r\nEach run begins with the player selecting a character from the unlocked roster. Subsequently, the game randomly assigns a level type to kick off the gameplay. Upon clearing each area in a level, the player is transported to a Virtual Reality room where a set of random options is presented. These options span from resting to remove entropy-induced debuffs, visiting the store for upgrades, taking a chance on a random bonus, to just simply continuing the run.\r\nPeriodically, players are also confronted with a randomized selection of bonuses, ranging from skill modifiers to increased damage output. Upon dying and failing, the concluded run along with the character is saved as an \"Evotype.\" which is a cool feature that I’ve never seen before in roguelites. This saved Evotype can be utilized to augment future runs, or even as a participant in Challenge runs.\r\nAs with being a roguelite, there are also persistent upgrades that players can purchase that are unlocked for all characters; such as increased Health points, an additional healing potion, an extra starting currency, or just plain increased damage output. There is also the procedurally generated Space Omega level that constantly refreshes and a Mind Challenge mode that pits you against a powerful boss for a chance to unlock new characters.\r\nThe procedurally generated levels ensures that no two runs are alike, encouraging players to adapt and strategize on the fly. The thrill of refining combat techniques, unlocking upgrades, and uncovering the hidden layers of the confusing narrative form a gratifying sense of progression that serves as a driving force throughout the adventure.\r\nSmooth gameplay aside, the story comes across as somewhat nonsensical and pretentious due to its mysterious VR simulation premise and your main character being a robot. The inclusion of BlazBlue characters feels somewhat out of place and doesn't seem to harmonize with the actual BlazBlue franchise. It feels like the game was originally developed as another game entirely, and then suddenly the makers decided to include Blazblue characters out of nowhere even if it didn't make sense. The game is available in three languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, but voice acting is only locked to Chinese.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6149526) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "War Thunder Mobile\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nGraphics & MusicGameplay\r\nWar Thunder Mobile, an extension of the popular War Thunder franchise, brings the adrenaline-pumping world of vehicular combat to the palm of your hands. Developed by Gaijin, this mobile adaptation offers a condensed yet authentic War Thunder experience, focusing on ground and naval warfare while introducing streamlined mechanics tailored for mobile gameplay.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Smooth Gameplay Performance\r\n- AAA Graphics\r\n- Intuitive Touch Controls\r\n- Streamlined Progression System\r\n- Familiar maps, but modified for faster-paced battles with increased spawn points and closer starting positions.## Cons\r\n- No dedicated aircraft warfare mode\r\n- Intrusive self-promoting ads for premium content\r\nWar Thunder Mobile easily stands out for its amazing console-like graphics. The game successfully maintains the signature War Thunder aesthetic, delivering remarkable graphics that hold up even on the limited hardware of mobile devices. The attention to detail in both tank and ship models, as well as the environments, is very impressive.\r\nThe art direction aligns seamlessly with the mobile platform's constraints. The user interface strikes a balance between functionality and aesthetics, providing essential information without overwhelming the player. The maps, while scaled down to suit the mobile playstyle, retain the essence of larger-scale battles found in the main game. This approach keeps battles engaging and fast-paced, fostering intense close-quarters combat and calculated strategic maneuvers.\r\nWar Thunder Mobile introduces novel gameplay mechanics to cater to the mobile gaming landscape. The controls are intentionally simplified yet intuitive, ensuring that players can dive into battle without the need for an extensive learning curve. Control schemes vary between the tanks and ships modes: tanks require constant touch and hold input for control, effectively translating the experience of maneuvering these massive war machines to touchscreens, while ships offer more of a command control system. Ships only require setting the target's forward or backward speed, with steering being the primary manipulation required.\r\nThe aiming mechanics in War Thunder Mobile offer a level of precision that players of the franchise will find familiar. With both drop and aim indicators, hitting your target requires strategy and skill. The game allows for adjustable zoom levels, ranging from no zoom to maximum. When at maximum zoom, the camera zooms in to match the size of the enemy unit, irrespective of distance, there is also a bit of auto-aiming / tracking involved so the camera follows the unit you are currently aiming at.\r\nDeath cams and enemy hit cams also exist, which provides a useful insight into what happened and what parts of the unit were hit, it even comes with cool animations.\r\nWhile War Thunder Mobile only has ground (Tank) and naval (Ship) warfare for now, it still has aircraft integration. While the game doesn't offer dedicated aircraft warfare, players can summon them for temporary support and even take control, introducing a strategic element to battles.\r\nThe aircraft controls are already implemented effectively, and it wouldn't be surprising if the developers eventually decide to expand and include them as a third option in the future.\r\nThe progression system in War Thunder Mobile deviates from its main counterpart, introducing a unique way of unlocking vehicles and upgrading them. This system, based on \"Platoons,\" rewards players for their gameplay efforts by unlocking new groups of vehicles across the board and enhancing existing ones.\r\nThe traditional research tree, individual vehicle or nation grinding, part system, from the main game is gone, and instead replaced by a linear unlock system, as well as an attribute system that all contributes to a much more streamlined experience.\r\nThe maps in War Thunder Mobile are very slightly modified versions of the classic maps from the main game. With three spawn points instead of the usual two and spawns positioned closer to the middle, battles tend to be more action-packed and more bite-sized, fitting for a mobile-centric on-the-go experience, with the battles usually lasting around five to ten minutes each. Bots are pretty much common in the early matches, but slowly gets filled with real people as you play more.\r\nIn terms of free-to-play monetization, War Thunder Mobile features a familiar strategy: the game is brim filled with self advertisements promoting premium content. These ads can serve as a gateway for players to explore and potentially invest in premium tanks and ships, enhancing their in-game experience. While this strategy may divide opinions among players, it's important to note that such practices are a standard part of free-to-play mobile games.\r\nIn my Snapdragon 888 device, the performance is actually satisfactory. I was able to achieve a locked 60fps on medium settings, with the option to increase the limit to 120fps. However, my phone wasn't able to maintain a locked 120fps performance. The overall performance feels polished and smooth, with no crashes or stutters.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6153153) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "War Thunder Mobile brings the high-octane world of vehicular combat to the palm of your hand with smooth gameplay and impressive AAA graphics. Ground and naval warfare take center stage, without any dedicated aircraft warfare modes.\r\nThe aiming mechanics mirror the main game, complete with drop and aim indicators, while adjustable zoom and tracking features enhance precision. Driving mechanics feel intuitive with the translated touch controls, with improved driver behavior and visual arrows around the tank aiding navigation. Observation tools like death cams and enemy hit cams enhance post-battle analysis.\r\nThe progression system has been streamlined—instead of grinding individual vehicles, you unlock lineups of four, leveling them up to unlock more vehicles and ammunition types. This shared lineup approach simplifies the grind and allows players to progress across nations and multiple vehicles simultaneously. The maps also mirror the main game but are slightly modified to cater mobile gaming's bite-sized nature, offering faster-paced battles with increased spawn points and closer starting positions.\r\nSo far, War Thunder Mobile definitely delivers an authentic War Thunder experience to mobile devices. Rather than simply porting the game 1:1, it intelligently adapts it for an enjoyable and streamlined mobile gaming experience. Currently, the primary game modes only feature ground and naval warfare, but I hope aircraft will be added in the future, and soon.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6153082) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Black Clover MTest US\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nBlack Clover M is a brand new gacha RPG mobile title developed by VIC Games Studio that has recently soft launched in Canada, with progression to carry over into the global launch that will follow.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful high-quality adaptation\r\n- Stunning cel-shaded anime visuals\r\n- Voice actors from the anime are returning\r\n- Auto-play features## Cons\r\n- Game requires access to contacts, photos, videos, and storage\r\n- Overwhelming amount of currencies and monetization techniques\r\nDrawing inspiration from the beloved anime and manga series, Black Clover M presents players with a high-quality adaptation that seamlessly integrates iconic scenes into the gameplay. The exceptional quality of animation brings the Manga and Anime into life, creating a visually striking experience. With cel-shaded graphics characteristic of anime adaptations, the game does justice to the visual aesthetics of the anime.\r\nThis turn-based RPG takes you on an exciting journey through a world steeped in magic… or anti-magic, all while featuring stunning scenes from the anime. The inclusion of esteemed voice actors like Gakuto Kajiwara, Nobunaga Shimazaki, Kana Yuuki, Junichi Suwabe, Daisuke Ono, and others adds an extra layer of authenticity, especially for Anime fans.\r\nAt its core, Black Clover M offers a traditional anime-based gacha RPG game. As you advance through the game, you'll have the opportunity to acquire potent gacha characters, enhance their abilities, and engage in an array of activities including single player story missions, repeatable farming missions, and asynchronous arena PvP battles.\r\nThe narrative leading up to the scenes remains faithfully recreated from the anime, albeit in a more condensed form. It seamlessly integrates battle sequences with the game's turn-based combat mechanics. Additionally, the game introduces certain creative liberties to allow for non-canon flexible character selection.\r\nThe game features an overworld exploration segment in which a chibi version of Asta can traverse the game world. This is intermixed with a third-person exploration mode when visiting significant locations like villages and castles, although with only a fixed camera angle and not much to do except go to the next objective.\r\nThe transition to turn-based combat follows a familiar format, with units taking turns to activate skills, factoring in cooldowns and SP points, and running a rock-paper-scissors weakness system under the hood. Synergistic attacks among teammates can be strategically employed based on the party composition.\r\nThe animated skills mirror the over-the-top and flashy style of the anime, though players are granted the option to limit or even disable these animations if needed. The combat and exploration aspects can both be carried out automatically.  It’s not a 100% idle game, but there are options for auto-combat and fast-forwarding during combat sequences. Similarly, for exploration, players have the convenience of clicking on the quest UI to enable the character to automatically navigate to the designated objective.,\r\nThe game's design subtly encourages engagement with its gacha and shop features, a common element in mobile titles. While this monetization approach might be considered typical for the genre, it's essential to recognize its influence on gameplay progression. Black Clover M is brimming with content, encompassing a variety of content types each associated with its own currency which can be a bit overwhelming.\r\nWhile this diversity may add depth, it also encourages spending real money. Additionally, the game's content might feel slightly inflated due to the inclusion of extra battles and even duplicate or unnecessary mechanics — like having multiple daily login bonuses — offering quantity without necessarily delivering substantial depth.\r\nThe free-to-play aspect is very much viable, at least during the initial hours of gameplay that I have experienced, although an energy system does introduce limitations. The game does slowly ease players into the limitation by providing bonus energies for new players, ensuring that early gameplay remains relatively unaffected. Notably, the game incorporates cosmetics, allowing players to personalize their experience and characters. Moreover, the game appears to offer a relatively forgiving approach to gacha mechanics, because I’ve already gotten some SSR in my first few hours of play.\r\nFrom a performance perspective, Black Clover M seems to run decently on devices like my Snapdragon 888 phone, even boasting an extensive graphics options menu that enables players to tailor the experience to their hardware capabilities.\r\nHowever, a very alarming concern with Black Clover M is the requirement for players to grant access to their contacts, photos and videos, as well as storage. Such access seems unnecessary for this game anyway and could potentially lead to data misuse or breaches.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6155373) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Developed by Weather Factory – the creators of another similar game in Cultist Simulator, Book of Hours captivates with its rich atmosphere and esoteric themes. Released on PC, it beckons players to explore the realms of the occult, inviting them to step into the shoes of an amnesiac librarian rebuilding a destroyed ancient library.\r\nThe core gameplay revolves around a card-based mechanic, where each card represents an action, item, or concept within the game's universe, and you must combine them with others to result in an outcome.  Most of the gameplay is centered around that concept, and even actions as mundane as speaking to a character about a topic, paying characters currency, or receiving rewards are all done via these card crafting system.\r\nEarly in the game, the protagonist — devoid of any memories — stumbles upon a village and eventually unlocks access to the central stage of the game: The Hush House. This dilapidated grand library must be painstakingly rebuilt, one room at a time, with the help of the villagers living nearby. Of course, this endeavor comes at a cost, requiring you to earn various currencies and favors to afford the repair and restoration of the library. The game, along with its actions and crafting, plays out in a real-time pausable manner, complete with a day/night cycle that refreshes the character’s energy, memories, and rerolls new sets of potential visitors and characters to interact with.\r\nSomewhat of a miracle, but somehow, many of the books inside the library have survived, albeit in dire need of management. Book of Hours embraces its central premise with fervor, allowing players to acquire and investigate occult books, catalog them, gain knowledge, and meet other visitors and scholars along the way.\r\nAs evident in the first few minutes of the game, Book of Hours is not for the majority of people out there. If you loved Cultist Simulator, you're probably going to like this game. However, for newcomers venturing in blindly, there's a good chance that this game might not resonate with you. If you're open-minded toward experimental and unconventional gameplay mechanics, value substance over style, and don't mind a relatively passive gameplay experience, then this game is probably right up your alley to try.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6174079) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players will assume control of Fortuna 200 years into her exile, what will happen is up to the players, reconnect with fellow Witches, forge new relationships, and utilize the Tarot cards you've customized to unveil their pasts and futures.\r\nHonestly, I thought the game was boring initially. First of all, there is no voice acting, which I value a lot when a game is narratively driven, there is lots of dialogue to read against a static pixel art background with nothing else for the players to do. However, the plot got more intriguing as I powered through the first few parts of the game, and then I was introduced to the actually cool Tarot Deck customization where the deck of cards I will use to read other characters is personally customized by the players. From the backgrounds to the characters to the symbols, up to the actual artwork you will see. The last part (artwork) is just for aesthetics purposes, but the rest have implications for the story, and the choices that you will make, that will matter.\r\nSo far, The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood presents a decent narrative experience. The gameplay, while taking a backseat to the story, remains engaging and manages to hold its own with its unique Tarot Deck personalization. The game's strengths predominantly lie in its storytelling prowess, weaving an intriguing and thought-provoking plot that captures players' attention, although I find that it's not suited for everyone, because of deeply mature and gender sensitive overtones.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6171758) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Wayfinder\r\n7.0\r\nAction\r\nWayfinder, an Online Action Role Playing Game, takes players on an adventure through a world filled with stylized characters, third person combat, and procedurally generated dungeons. While it draws parallels to games like Dauntless, Fortnite, and Darksiders, it is also promising to also bring its own unique elements to the table. The game features an intriguing blend of MMO lite and RPG elements, promising a mix of action-packed combat and immersive storytelling.\r\nWayfinder was recently released in a paid early access form last August 18, with a full free-to-play release planned to follow in six months. However, it appears that the game was launched with a multitude of server problems, and I myself included, have been encountering issues trying to access the game.\r\nThe Steam store page is now flooded with negative reviews addressing this very problem in the past three days, with no solution in sight. Many players are reporting that they've even exhausted their two-hour refund limit for the game just for the queues alone, and thus are now unable to refund the newly released game.\r\nThe Steam store page is now flooded with negative reviews addressing this very problem in the past three days,\r\nFortunately, some people have indeed gotten access in the game, especially those who have painstakingly waited an entire day or two for the queues, so we now have a closer look at the actual gameplay from various people. Youtuber SausBeans was kind enough to allow us to share his in-game footage, while we wait for server issues to subside for a proper review of this Early Access release. Thanks to SausBeans!\r\nLooks like the gameplay of Wayfinder revolves around an MMO lite experience, offering player interaction within a shared world while not fully immersing players in a traditional full blown open-world MMO environment. At its core, players engage in a series of missions called Expeditions, pursuing character and weapon level-ups. The central goal involves searching for specific loot to craft items and enhance their character(Wayfinder)’s power, creating a gameplay cycle of progression.\r\nSausBeans\r\nto allow us to share his in-game footage\r\nCharacter progression in Wayfinder hinges on several key systems. Primarily, progression involves leveling up both the Wayfinder and individual weapons. These two aspects are distinct and must be leveled up separately. The maximum level for both the Wayfinder and weapons is level 30. Progressing in one does not carry over to the other, necessitating individual attention to each character aspect.\r\nPresentation wise, it looks like a straight rip-off of Fortnite visuals, even the placement and visual design of hotkey abilities on the lower left side closely mirrors Fortnite..The damage indicators and font choices are oddly reminiscent and seem to resemble a standard Unreal Engine font that has been used in numerous games. The movements also feel like a typical Unreal Engine 4 shooter like Fortnite, but with abilities. The animations kind of look funky though, especially when using multiple moves and abilities one after the other.\r\nSo far this game has great potential, mechanically, its foundations appear solid, and the core gameplay loop is engaging. The combination of MMO lite features and instanced expeditions sets it apart from the standard MMORPG format, in which many players are growing tired of. However, Wayfinder is off to an extremely bad start, leaving a considerable number of players disappointed and alienated. The controversial paid early access phase ($20 for the base game, with a potential price of up to a staggering $149.99 for the Founders pack) raised eyebrows, and the situation was exacerbated by a host of server issues upon release. Can it recover from these setbacks? Only time will tell as we approach the months leading up to its full free-to-play release.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6171952) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This intricate game offers a multi-faceted experience that combines investigation, crafting, and introspection to create a truly unique adventure.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Atmospheric minimalistic artstyle\r\n- Addictive gameplay once you’ve understood the mechanics\r\n- Unique experience probably unlike anything you’ve experienced before## Cons\r\n-No tutorial\r\n-Very steep and confusing learning curve\r\n-Requires a lot of reading\r\nAt first glance, Book of Hours appears as a difficult concept to understand, and it is absolutely true, much like the arcane secrets it promises to unveil. Developed by Weather Factory – the creators of another similar game in Cultist Simulator, Book of Hours captivates with its rich atmosphere and esoteric themes. Released on PC, it beckons players to explore the realms of the occult, inviting them to step into the shoes of an amnesiac librarian rebuilding a destroyed ancient library.\r\nThe artstyle might appear deceptively simple — even looking like a Flash game from the early 2000s, yet it's this simplicity that adds to its mystique. The game adopts a minimalist approach with a rich, dark color palette that sets the tone for the eerie and secretive world it encapsulates. Its visuals are reminiscent of vintage hand-drawn illustrations found in ancient grimoires, while also mixing it with a stylized cartoon-esque formula. The soundtrack is relaxing and fitting for the game’s combat-free direction. In the game’s UI you are even given controls to pause, skip to the next track, and go back to the previous track of the current soundtrack that is playing.\r\nBook of Hours has a very unique and unconventional approach to its gameplay mechanics. The game begins around two primary actions: Considering and Talking, both of which play a pivotal role in crafting cards and progressing the narrative. The core gameplay revolves around a card-based mechanic, where each card represents an action, item, or concept within the game's universe, and you must combine them with others to result in an outcome.\r\nThere is no voice acting or narration, and everything must be read by the player. The game is heavy on the reading aspect, especially with all the cards and concepts having their own descriptions that are actually important for the gameplay and not just for extra flavor.\r\nMost of the gameplay is centered around that concept, and even actions as mundane as speaking to a character about a topic, paying characters currency, or receiving rewards are all done via these card crafting system. Each of the cards has their own sets of “principles” as the game calls it, that must align with the object or character you are trying to interact with. These principles are actually plentiful and are hard to keep track of, which may result in back-and-forth-ing in the early parts, comparing different cards to determine their compatibility with one another.\r\nEarly in the game, the protagonist — devoid of any memories — stumbles upon a village and eventually unlocks access to the central stage of the game: The Hush House. This dilapidated grand library must be painstakingly rebuilt, one room at a time, with the help of the villagers living nearby.\r\nOf course, this endeavor comes at a cost, requiring you to earn various currencies and favors to afford the repair and restoration of the library. The game, along with its actions and crafting, plays out in a real-time pausable manner, complete with a day/night cycle that refreshes the character’s energy, memories, and rerolls new sets of potential visitors and characters to interact with as days pass.\r\nSomewhat of a miracle, but somehow, many of the books inside the library have survived, albeit in dire need of management. Book of Hours embraces its central premise with fervor, allowing players to acquire and investigate occult books, catalog them, gain knowledge, and meet other visitors and scholars along the way. This mechanic serves as a gateway to an intricately woven narrative that rewards careful attention and exploration. As the layers of mystery are peeled back, players find themselves immersed in a world that teems with enigmatic stories, arcane rituals, and a sense of wonder akin to flipping through the pages of a forbidden tome.\r\nThe game's mechanics are as multifaceted as the lore it unravels. Crafting inks, memories, and other esoteric tools isn't just a mechanic—it's an integral part of the experience, underscoring the meticulous nature of arcane practices. The study of nine Wisdoms and the conquest of the nine Elements of the Soul not only offer a fascinating challenge but also contribute to the personal growth and transformation of the player's character and the unveiling of the character’s past and origins, based on the player's choice.\r\nWeather Factory's penchant for obscurity and self-discovery is evident in Book of Hours. The game doesn't hold your hand, but rather encourages you to piece together the narrative through experimentation and exploration. This approach adds depth and engagement, making each discovery feel like a personal triumph. However, it's worth noting that the learning curve may be too steep for newcomers, making the experience extremely niche and not for everyone; some quality of life improvements in the UI, and a proper comprehensive beginners tutorial would enhance the experience for all players.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6174112) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood\r\nThe Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is a captivating story-driven game that presents players with an immersive narrative experience that revolves around Fortuna, a fortune-teller Witch banished to exile on an asteroid. Developed by the creators of The Red Strings Club and feeling like a spiritual successor, The game's premise is rooted in crafting a personalized Tarot deck, reclaiming freedom, and influencing the destiny of the cosmic Witch society.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Intriguing Narrative that carries the whole game\r\n- Personalize your own Tarot Deck of cards, including the artwork\r\n- Well written story and characters\r\n- Choices do matter## Cons\r\n-Zero voice acting, players must read everything in this narrative driven game\r\n-Slow pacing, especially the first few minutes\r\n-For mature audiences only\r\nThe Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood allows players to assume the role of Fortuna, a Witch exiled for a thousand years who forms a forbidden pact with a godlike otherworldly creature to regain her freedom. Players will assume control of Fortuna 200 years into her exile, what will happen is up to the players, reconnect with fellow Witches, forge new relationships, and utilize the Tarot cards you've customized to unveil their pasts and futures. The narrative spans generations, inviting players to contemplate the intricate themes of identity, community, and individual responsibility within the beautifully handcrafted world, providing a thought-provoking depth that resonates with players.\r\nThe game features a retro art style and visual presentation common in indie games. The pixel art creates a mesmerizing and distinct atmosphere that I would like to compare to the recent game that I’ve played, Coffee Talk. The lack of voice acting is compensated by the soundtrack that spans over three hours, offering a range of melodies that complement the game's themes and emotions. The absence of voice acting in favor of silent interactions contributes to the slice of life ambiance, adding a unique touch to the storytelling. This approach aligns with the retro low-fi visual vibe, merging seamlessly with the narrative and gameplay.\r\nThe plot is rightfully intriguing; even without voice acting, it compelled me to play. However, it can get a bit boring honestly, especially in the first few minutes --- with lots of dialogue to read against a static pixel art background with nothing else for the players to do. ---- this is before everything related to Tarot Deck customization and deck building clicks in, which made the game actually compelling to play.\r\nWhile gameplay takes a backseat to the narrative, it isn't entirely overlooked. The customization and crafting system of the Tarot deck provides an engaging mechanic that goes beyond aesthetics. You can tailor your deck by selecting from a variety of backgrounds, characters, and symbols, each with its own meaning when fused together. Furthermore, you have the opportunity to design the artwork of each card individually, gradually building your deck over time. The currency to craft these cards takes the form of the elemental energies; Air, Water, Earth, and Fire, which are then replenished by performing readings with characters, enabling you to craft additional cards for your deck.\r\nAlthough the card artwork editor doesn't drastically alter the gameplay, it injects a flavor of personality into the experience, which is actually quite cool and serves as the one of main draws, as this personal customization provides a sense of personal investment and a core personality to the gameplay.\r\nAdditionally, the choices you make genuinely matter, shaping the course of the story and the fate of the Witch society. This balance between narrative-driven and gameplay-driven elements creates an experience that caters to players seeking both engagement and emotional resonance.\r\nThe Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood's plot shines with its well-written narrative and multi-dimensional characters. Despite the fantastical elements like witches and godly beings, the characters are portrayed in a relatable and authentic manner, each harboring their own distinct relationships and complexities. In total, it can take players up to ten hours to finish one playthrough.\r\nEach Witch, old or new, carries their own baggage and relationships, contributing to the complex web of interests that surround the coven and beyond. This depth transforms the characters — well, most of them — from mere game elements into individuals you care about, driving your desire to influence their destinies. Despite having a good story, it's not for everyone, it catered for more mature audiences especially for sexual and gender sensitive overtones, but if you’re fine with those, then by all means.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6171759) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This is due to the fact that it serves as its spiritual successor, if the ‘Shadow’ in the title and same developers are not yet a dead giveaway.\r\nThe main gameplay revolves around utilizing the special abilities of each character to navigate through complex levels filled with enemies and obstacles. It plays out in a point-and-click manner with an isometric camera to see all the action. Characters can perform various actions such as sneaking, running, climbing walls, and interacting with the environment or enemy units.

The voice acting and writing is decent. What's even more impressive is the seamless and fluid gameplay paired with enjoyable game mechanics. The game takes the Commandos/Shadow Tactics formula and elevates it to modern perfection. The clunkiness and quirkiness often associated with classic point-and-click stealth games have been effectively eliminated.\r\nAnd it supports dual control schemes! Both mouse/keyboard and gamepads are completely viable. While the keyboard/mouse controls maintain the point-and-click feel, the gamepad support provides a different experience by offering direct control over characters using the left analog sticks. This approach is reminiscent of traditional action stealth games, albeit with an overhead camera perspective. The two control schemes offer distinct gameplay experiences, making them feel like different games on a control scheme level. However, both approaches are equally viable and intuitive.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6177327) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This is due to the fact that it serves as its spiritual successor, if the ‘Shadow’ in the title and same developers are not yet a dead giveaway.\r\nShadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew features an art style characterized by stylized 3D graphics that evoke the feeling of Pirates of the Caribbean that just got even more Disney-fied in captivating 3D animation. The characters, ships, and environments are rendered with a colorful palette that immerses players in the fantastical world of pirates and curses.\r\nAt its core, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is a stealth strategy game that draws inspiration from the aforementioned classic titles like the Commandos series and the newer Shadow Tactics. The gameplay revolves around Afia and her cursed crew aboard a Ghost Ship, each possessing unique supernatural abilities. Players must navigate treacherous scenarios, overcoming the challenges presented by the Inquisition and the Curse of Lost Souls.\r\nThe main gameplay revolves around utilizing the special abilities of each character to navigate through complex levels filled with enemies and obstacles. It plays out in a point-and-click manner with an isometric camera to see all the action. Characters can perform various actions such as sneaking, running, climbing walls, and interacting with the environment or enemy units. The coordination required to execute strategies involving all these characters is both challenging and rewarding.\r\nThere are gameplay mechanics and challenges that will demand precise timing and execution with your crewmates, such as enemy pairs that must be killed simultaneously, or powerful units that will take two of your units to take down. Thankfully, we do have the paused “Shadow Mode'' which allows us to queue one command per crew mate, and time their execution the way we see fit, usually simultaneously. I would have loved a queuing system that allows for more than one command, but I understand that this may have complicated things.\r\nPlayers start with Aifa, and then proceed to unlock more crew members as the game progresses. The game features intriguing powers for each pirate — some can possess enemy units, some can snipe people from afar, and some can climb in vines, or perhaps swim. Characters which can be unlocked in any order and are applicable to every mission, providing an open-ended element. Batches of missions can also be done in any order as the players see fit.\r\nThe progression is well-paced, with each mission and character unlock introducing new challenges and mechanics that keep the gameplay fresh. The game's difficulty increases gradually, pushing players to refine their strategies and adapt to more complex scenarios.. Moreover, the game provides well-crafted tooltips and a comprehensive tutorial for each character, aiding players of all skill levels in quickly getting up to speed.\r\nAlong with the ‘Shadow Mode’, the ghost ship’s powers introduce an innovative (or familiar?) time-manipulation mechanic. Players can quicksave and quickload \"memories\" seamlessly, a feature that's integrated into the lore of the game. This mechanic empowers players to adapt their tactics on the fly, promoting ‘save-scumming’ experimentation and creative problem-solving. It's a gameplay element that sets Shadow Gambit apart from traditional stealth strategy games where saving is frowned upon, and offers an unprecedented level of freedom.\r\nShadow Gambit caters to players' preferences by offering dual control schemes. Mouse and keyboard controls emulate the point-and-click style of classic stealth games, while gamepad support allows for direct control of characters. Both control schemes are viable and offer distinct gameplay experiences, enhancing accessibility for a wider audience, although you might want to pick only a single scheme for your playthrough or rerun the tutorials twice, as the controls vary between each other drastically and feel like different games entirely.\r\nWhat’s also cool is the extra flavor this game has, even after the mission ends, players are treated to performance scores, and there is even a quick overhead time lapse view, tracking all your activities during the mission like an auto-recording history ledger. However, one minor gripe lies in the inability to skip almost all dialogues on a per-line basis, which can occasionally disrupt the pacing, either go through them at a normal pace or skip them completely.\r\nWhile Shadow Gambit generally maintains smooth performance when it matters, I’ve experienced severe FPS drops when zooming out to view expansive maps. The game is definitely CPU limited, and my i7-8700k is already showing signs of aging with this title. This hiccup in performance doesn't overshadow the overall positive experience but does warrant attention for potential improvements.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6177343) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Kill The Crows\r\nThe untamed landscapes, the rugged characters, and the thrill of a quickdraw duel – it's a recipe for unforgettable experiences. Kill the Crows, a fast-paced arena roguelike shooter, tries to encapsulate this feeling in a top-down roguelite format.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Simple, easy to pick up controls and mechanics\r\n- Intense one-shot, one-kill combat\r\n- Progression that is done via milestones and not resources and currencies\r\n- Immersive gunslinging experience## Cons\r\n-Not much gameplay depth and variety to counter the repetitive nature of roguelite games\r\n-Only one arena/level to play in\r\nKill the Crows thrusts players into a world fraught with danger and overwhelming vengeance. The story follows a gunslinger consumed by the fire of retribution, wandering through the ruins of a forsaken wild west town and attacked by an onslaught of enemies, both regular goons and those with supernatural abilities.\r\nThis arena roguelite shooter draws inspiration from its wild west roots while embracing modern mechanics. The arena gameplay setup itself feels like a nod to popular games like Vampire Survivors and Brotato, yet it takes a different approach, forgoing auto-casted skills and abilities for a more traditional top-down shooter combat.\r\nVisually, Kill the Crows boasts an artistic direction featuring retro low-fi graphics that reminded me immediately of the classic title Another World. This aesthetic choice surprisingly captures the essence of the wild west era, transporting players to a time when the world was painted in a palette of rugged authenticity.\r\nStarting the game, Kill the Crows wastes no time in plunging players into the heart of the action. As a gunslinger, players are tasked with surviving the onslaught of enemies. There’s really not much complexity here other than moving around, shooting, and surviving. That’s not to say the game isn’t challenging; in fact, it's actually ridiculously difficult. You can one-shot basically all enemies, but all it takes to kill you is also one shot—just one unnoticed bullet, and you're down.\r\nThe controls are deceptively simple: aiming with the mouse, movement with WASD, and dodging with space. Yet, within this simplicity lies a challenge that requires both finesse and strategy. To introduce more complexity and challenge, reloading is manually done, which adds a bit of frantic immersion to the gunslinging action, which reminded me of another gunslinging action with the Time Crisis arcade games series.\r\nAs a Roguelite, it comes with persistent progression in the form of achievements and milestones that unlock new weapons, perks, and special abilities — No pesky resources and skill points to collect.\r\nThe special abilities are highly reminiscent of Red Dead Redemption’s Dead Eye targeting, where time slows down, giving players the ability to aim at multiple targets and dispatch them quickly in succession. This special ability replenishes during combat upon achieving more kills.\r\nThere is only one continuous backdrop level, and dying resets all level progress back to zero. This includes rebattling all the bosses from the beginning and taking just as long to get back to where you died. While the unlockables can provide some assistance, ultimate survival relies heavily on player skill and mastery. Unfortunately, there isn't much gameplay depth to counteract the inherent repetitiveness of roguelite games. Therefore, if you find yourself stuck on a boss fight or level multiple times without meaningful persistent progress, the game can start to feel VERY repetitive.\r\nDespite its retro graphics, Kill the Crows excels at immersing players in its world and is brimming with flavor. The blood splatter from shot enemies, the thunderous gunshot sounds that accentuate the power of a well-aimed shot, and the rising dust with every interaction with the environment – these elements converge to create a sensory experience that's rich and dynamic.\r\nNo disrespect to Red Dead Redemption 2’s ultra immersive and borderline-simulation qualities, but this game really did a better job of making me feel like an unstoppable deadeye Cowboy, which speaks volumes for its quality. Not only did I feel like a badass cowboy, but at times, I even felt like Cleric John Preston from Equilibrium, utilizing Gun Kata with the speed at which I was aiming left and right, dispatching enemies in quick succession.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6182572) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It is a follow-up to the similarly titled relaxing game Cats & Soup, made by the same developers Hidea.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Whimsical, charming visuals and soundtrack\r\n- Merge game mechanics, with a cooking twist\r\n- Challenging puzzles\r\n- Filled with attention to detail, mini-games, and activities\r\n- Very considerate in monetization aspects (optional ads only)## Cons\r\n- Cooking serves merely as a facade, it's really a merge puzzle game through and through\r\nCats & Soup: Magic Recipe welcomes players to a charming beachside kingdom that oozes with wholesome vibes. The visuals are charming, characterized by a hand-painted art style that invokes the warmth and charm of a beloved children's storybook. The soundtrack complements the visuals with its relaxing and soothing melodies.The game's world is filled with vibrant environments and characters, all brought to life through really well made animations and stylized art design.\r\nCats & Soup: Magic Recipe combines the addictive nature of merge mechanics with the joy of cooking. Players assume the role of a magical cat, tasked with preparing a variety of delectable dishes by merging different ingredients. It features a variety of dishes to cook; from soup, juices, rice meals, to even potions.\r\nThe game features an adorable cast of magical cats, each with their own unique personalities and skills related to cooking. Players are tasked with gathering ingredients from different sources within the kingdom, such as the Vegetable Garden, Greenhouse, Herbal Shop, Granary, Fishing Spot, and more.\r\nThese ingredients are gathered using magical energy, which functions as a finite resource similar to a stamina or energy system that can limit progression when exhausted; however ,in my experience, they are plentiful and I have only ran out of them once.\r\nThe merging mechanics involve combining identical ingredients to create higher-tiered ingredients, which are then used to craft the different dishes available in the game. The merging process is reminiscent of a 'match-two' concept seen in games like 2048, which retains that highly addictive aspect. Despite not making any logical sense, where combining two potatoes results in one garlic, and two carrots into one parnish, the system really works well and is very addicting.\r\nAs players progress through the game, they unlock new recipes, dish types, and ingredients, providing a sense of continual discovery and progression, where players strategically merge ingredients to create more complex and flavorful dishes. The game introduces an element of strategy and puzzle-solving as players need to carefully plan their merging sequences to optimize their progress. At some point, though, the novelty of cooking wears off, and you begin to view the game primarily as a puzzle experience – collecting and matching items en masse to achieve the goal – rather than as a genuine culinary video game.\r\nThe blocks available to place ingredients have limited space, and some ingredients only come up every so often that you’d probably gather a lot of undesirables while targeting specific dishes to cook. Fortunately, any excess ingredients not in use can be discarded to make room for new ones as needed. In fact, there's no real concept of failing in this game; it maintains a continuous progression of unlocking new recipes and dish types. Even if you run out of energy to summon new ingredients, you can just wait it out, watch some ads, or use any of the currencies to buy new energy.\r\nI could not find any in-game purchases yet, but the foundations for premium currencies and cosmetics are already evident. Currently, any form of monetization in this game only comes from ads.  As the game is still in a soft launch state, progression can be reset anytime. It's important to note that certain aspects of the gameplay and monetization may continue to evolve based on player feedback and development updates.\r\nIn addition to the merging gameplay, Cats & Soup: Magic Recipe offers various mini-games that add variety and engagement to the experience. Players can enjoy activities such as catching fish, popping bubbles while on a bicycle, and dressing up their magical cats with unlocked cosmetics. These mini-games provide a refreshing break from the core cooking mechanics and contribute to the game's replayability.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6184988) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Instead, it is a traditional auto-chess gacha game tailored for mobile platforms. Nonetheless, its visual appeal remains as stunning as depicted in the promotional images and trailers.\r\nThe gameplay of SOULS instead revolves around assembling a team of five heroes, placing them strategically on a hexagonal grid map against opposing forces, and relying on their hero power to emerge victorious, with the battles automatically played out. While the game doesn't delve deeply into its backstory beyond its apocalyptic premise, it wastes no time thrusting players into action minutes after launching.\r\nAs players progress through the chapters level by level, they unlock rewards and gain access to a diverse array of characters and loot. The developers are boasting to have introduced over 60 heroes, each with distinct abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. These heroes can be enhanced using resources obtained from gameplay, and equipment can also be acquired and subsequently upgraded.\r\nI found the progression to be genuinely engaging, and notably generous for the most part. I was getting all kinds of currencies just by playing normally. There are plenty of live service bonuses implemented: daily, weekly logins, challenges and milestone rewards around every move you make. It’s basically flooding players with currency that it didn’t bother my F2P experience at all. The only resource I occasionally found myself lacking was the one required to advance a character and unlock the next tier of leveling. Nevertheless, it was merely a matter of time until I acquired those resources as well.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6186579) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "BRIXITY - Sandbox&Multiplayer\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nBRIXITY is an innovative sandbox city-building game that invites players to embark on a creative journey of restoration and construction. Set in a world that suffered a collapse five centuries ago, players are tasked with rebuilding Earth using the remarkable BRIX technology.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Wholesome gameplay for all ages\r\n- Charming and cute visuals\r\n- Freedom to build custom buildings and structures and share it with the community\r\n- Explore both your own city and those by others in third person## Cons\r\n- Paywalls limit players’ creativity and choices\r\n- time consuming, progression and currency requires real-time waiting\r\nThe central gameplay is about constructing structures and building entire cities in top-down view with the help of the amazing technology called BRIX, and then exploring the world and visiting other players in a third-person view. BRIX (as in “bricks”, essentially the building blocks that players can use to create buildings) allows players to create spectacular builds as they wish.\r\nBRIXITY’s artstyle is delightfully charming with a fusion of vibrant colors and whimsical blocky Minecraft-ish design, reminiscent of a children's cartoon or story book brought to video game form. The game world is adorned with lovable details that breathe life into the adorable cities.\r\nThe city-building system draws inspiration from the conventional mobile city-builder framework, reminiscent of titles like Clash of Clans or Rise of Kingdoms, albeit without any combat or fantasy elements and with its own unique and charming twist. Players have the freedom to place structures, buildings, and build their city using coins, and slowly reclaim more plots of land as they progress.\r\nAt the heart of this progression lies the Earth Restoration Center, which serves as the “Town Hall” of the city, completion of the required missions will allow you to upgrade the center to the next level, thus unlocking additional structures and ways to earn currencies. In some of the tasks, such as upgrading the Center or reclaiming plots of land, players will have to wait in real time for these to be completed.\r\nPlayers are encouraged to create their own custom buildings, houses, statues, and a myriad of other elements through the intuitive builder menu. By placing individual blocks, they can bring their unique designs to life, bound by only their creativity. However, for those who lean towards a more city-building-oriented gameplay style, they can continue just using pre-made blueprints.\r\nThese players can effortlessly choose from a selection of pre-designed blueprints, even utilizing the game's semi auto-piloted assistance to construct these structures via the builder menu. These pre-existing blueprints can be from the game itself or from creations contributed by other players. Additionally, players can collect special BRIX, which players can place in their cities.\r\nThe humans are now called Pipos for some reason, and gradually make their way into your city, arriving one by one.. Pipos in turn can be placed in buildings to improve their stats, such as in generating coins every hour. Beyond their functional contribution, they also inject a sense of character and charm into the city's visual aesthetics, as they can be placed in various locations to elevate its overall appearance.\r\nBRIX, the building blocks that form the foundation of the game's creative possibilities, are acquired through a loot box system. Conversely, the introduction of Pipos to your city occurs through a gacha roll system, which adds an element of excitement and anticipation to their arrival. However, it's worth acknowledging that the inclusion of gacha systems, loot boxes, and premium currency can potentially impact players' artistic freedom and innovative capabilities by imposing certain limitations, such as putting cosmetics or upgrades into premium territory. It’s not pay to win per se, but pay to create cooler designs.\r\nAlthough the combination of city-building elements, Minecraft like block buildings, and the use of gacha rolls for characters are indeed unconventional. The whole mechanic is very well thought off and seamlessly flows with one another.\r\nWhat I also love about this game is its wholesomeness, there is no combat, no violence, and no revealing waifu elements, resulting in an experience that is universally welcoming to all age groups, particularly children.\r\nThe social aspect of the game is where players can customize their Pipos, share blueprints with others, invite others to visit their cities, or personally visit other players’ cities in third person. They can even participate in a mini-quest of hunting for collectibles. Players can also rate other cities to get more rewards. This adds a layer of interaction and personalization to the experience. It encourages players to showcase their creativity and share their achievements with others.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6191888) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Bibots\r\nBibots is a roguelite dungeon crawler shooter where players take on the role of a warrior that can pilot mech armors called Bibots. As Tayar, you are the only one left standing (literally) and the only savior of his world.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Pleasing HD visuals\r\n- Intense bullet-hell action\r\n- Variety of weapons and upgrades to experiment with\r\n- Procedurally generated levels and easy traversal mechanics## Cons\r\n- The touch controls are floaty and clunky\r\n- The titular Bibots are underutilized as a gameplay concept\r\n- Persistent progression is a bit grindy, even for a roguelite\r\nBibots features a unique HD-2D art style that primarily incorporates intricately drawn cartoon visuals, creating a surreal and gentle atmosphere. The style predominantly employs dark color palettes with subtle neon lighting undertones. The visual effects are pleasing to the eye, and even amidst the chaotic bullet hell screen clutter, the action remains visually coherent, with projectiles remaining easily discernible.\r\nThe game is currently available for a discounted pre-order of $3.99 USD (from $5.99 USD) on the AppStore and open for pre-registration on the PlayStore, the game is also available for PC on Epic and Steam since last year. The mobile release date is set for August 29, 2023.\r\nThe gameplay mechanics in Bibots follow a classic twin-stick shooter formula: character movement is controlled using the left stick, while aiming and shooting are executed with the right stick. A well-timed dodge mechanic proves crucial for evading enemy projectiles, and the inclusion of obtainable secondary attacks, like grenades or flying discs, adds tactical depth. The main event, however, is the titular Bibot-summoning special ability. This powerful ally can be deployed defensively or offensively, during intense encounters against a diverse array of enemy types and formidable bosses.\r\nWhile Bibots pays homage to the twin-stick shooter genre, it does introduce a unique challenge: the controls, more specifically the implementation of touch controls. Movement feels floaty, and aiming demands manual precision via the right stick, which makes it a bit more difficult than its usual mobile contemporaries who have auto attack or auto target mechanics. Overall, the controls feel very clunky and frustrating that it introduces an added challenge, and further impedes actual enjoyment of the would-be fun game mechanics. I never really felt in total control while playing.\r\nThe game mechanics on the other hand are actually decent for a rogue-lite: Bibots employs a rogue-lite approach that encourages experimentation and replay value. As players journey through the game's levels, they're presented with a series of three random choices for temporary upgrades in each run. These choices encompass stat boosts and new modifiers, such as health augmentation or chance-to-freeze effects. The progression extends to loot acquisition, with chests and merchants strategically scattered across the map. Weapon diversity  and modifiers are all fun to try and use, as each weapon flaunts distinct attributes, from projectile behaviors to splash damage effects.\r\nLevel design mirrors the unpredictability of rogue-lites, featuring procedurally generated dungeons and multiple pathways. A commendable feature is a non-linear layout that avoids monotony. Conveniently, the player can teleport to previously cleared rooms, streamlining map traversal and erasing unnecessary backtracking.\r\nPersistent progression comes in the form of leveling different types of Bibots, each boasting its unique strengths and play styles. As well as unlocking new passives called “Compos’ups” for purchase. These modifications range from imbuing projectiles with poison to straightforward damage amplifications.\r\nFair or unfair, the game certainly presents a formidable challenge, I already died many times even on the first level and before encountering the first boss. Restarting isn’t a problem as there is fun to be had in trying out different weapons and upgrade combinations.\r\nHowever, I feel that the titular Bibots are too underutilized: when activated via the ultimate ability which takes quite some time to fill up, it is only summoned for a few seconds and it’s gone in almost an instant. Leveling them up also takes quite a while and even if you unlock new Compos’ups, you’d still have to farm the currency to unlock these and use them.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6195071) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines can now enjoy these brand new servers.\r\nAs you lead your own catgirl squad in Cat Fantasy, you'll alternate between the management of cat-cafe life and mysterious investigations involving monsters called anomalies, deranged felines, and evil rabbit dolls—all while uncovering the truth behind the existence of an alarming number of diseases plaguing the city.\r\nPlayers dive into a world filled with waifu catgirl characters, collecting and summoning them for exciting turn-based combat and compelling gacha action.  At its core, Cat Fantasy employs a turn-based combat system reminiscent of the mechanics found in games like 7 Deadly Sins. Players engage in battles by utilizing a deck of cards representing various attacks and abilities. The unique mechanic here is the ability to merge adjacent cards to form more potent attacks, adding a strategic layer to the combat.\r\nBeyond the main story, which spans an impressive number of chapters and missions, there’s also a plethora of side game modes. These include a Cafe management segment where you're tasked with overseeing menu offerings, staff assignments, catering deliveries, and the progressive enhancement of the Cafe’s level. Additionally, there are other combat-oriented game modes catered for the purpose of farming specific materials to level up characters and gathering ingredients for crafting potential menu items in the Cafe.\r\nCurrently, the game is a bit generous across the board. There is an stamina/energy system designed to limit play, but I was overflowing with it for the first few hours that I played. I also received a lot of gold for general use, and currency for numerous gacha rolls in which I received one SSR characters early on, and multiple SR characters. While the closed beta test currently underway has gacha and premium currency implemented, the final model of the game remains to be seen. I hope the developers strike a balance that ensures an enjoyable experience for free-to-play players too.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6194209) Originally posted on TapTap.",

More specifically, Cat Fantasy has extended its reach by launching a dedicated server for Southeast Asian players. This means that gamers in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines can now enjoy these brand new servers. This change was rolled out last October 27.\r\nAfter the update, players have received 50 Pathos Crystals and 500 Phantom Coins. Moreover, the ranking rewards from Phantom Training have been adjusted, providing even more incentives for in-game achievements. The game also started a public test realm (PTR) last October 25.\r\nCat Fantasy is a turn-based gacha RPG that immerses players in a world of catgirls known as Felines. Stepping into the shoes of a newly instated human inspector at StormEye, you are an investigation officer who is also assigned to manage a cafe named Cat of Baker Street. If this game feels familiar, it's worth noting that a version of it is also known as Cat Planet in the China region.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Appealing art style and waifu cat girls\r\n- Variety of Game modes, including a Cafe management element\r\n- A refreshing merging-based combat system\r\n- Auto-play and speed-up combat\r\n- Generous progression rates## Cons\r\n- Lengthy cutscenes, cannot skip individual lines of dialogue\r\n- Confusing card design for merge gameplay\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\nThese pros and cons are based on Closed Beta Test done by August 2023 and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product\r\nAs you lead your own catgirl squad, you'll alternate between the management of cat-cafe life and mysterious investigations involving monsters called anomalies, deranged felines, and evil rabbit dolls—all while uncovering the truth behind the existence of an alarming number of diseases plaguing the city.\r\nIt features cel-shaded graphics and an anime-inspired art style along with a similarly themed soundtrack. The graphics are highly detailed, the animations are fluid, and the catgirl character designs are obviously waifu, but it’s nothing we’ve not seen before.\r\nThe game begins with your character having a dream where in it he’s already a seasoned inspector, about an impending apocalypse with only 40 minutes remaining before it occurs. However, following a series of unfortunate events within the dream, the character awakens in the present day, on their first day as an inspector. This day is set approximately 136 days before the events of the dream.\r\nAt its core, Cat Fantasy employs a turn-based combat system reminiscent of the mechanics found in games like 7 Deadly Sins. Players engage in battles by utilizing a deck of cards representing various attacks and abilities. The unique mechanic here is the ability to merge adjacent cards to form more potent attacks, adding a strategic layer to the combat. This merging mechanic requires players to consider their moves carefully. For those seeking convenience, the game offers an auto-play option, allowing for streamlined combat encounters. Additionally, a speed-up feature of 2x, with 3x accessible through a premium option, caters to players who prefer faster-paced gameplay.\r\nThe game's narrative is a prominent aspect, but it might be a double-edged sword for some players. Cat Fantasy boasts an extensive array of cutscenes, both in traditional format and visual novel style. While these cutscenes contribute to the depth of the story, they are very long and drawn out. Without voice acting and some of the dialogue being unskippable on a per line basis, it got a little boring that it compelled me to skip some dialogue scenes completely.\r\nFortunately, players can read a summarized version of the cutscenes instead, which is a neat feature that’s getting popular nowadays, albeit it still needs work as some of the sentences are occasionally cut short. There is no voice acting at the moment in the cutscene dialogues, but in gameplay there are voice lines from the characters.\r\nCombat in Cat Fantasy is visually engaging and appealing, with beautiful skill animations — especially the special ones — adding flair to each attack. However, some players might find certain cards challenging to distinguish from one another due to their very similar designs, which unnecessarily complicates the merging aspect of the gameplay.\r\nBeyond the main story, which spans an impressive number of chapters and missions, there’s also a plethora of side game modes. These include a Cafe management segment where you're tasked with overseeing menu offerings, staff assignments, catering deliveries, and the progressive enhancement of the Cafe’s level. Additionally, there are other combat-oriented game modes catered for the purpose of farming specific materials to level up characters and gathering ingredients for crafting potential menu items in the Cafe.\r\nCurrently, the game is a bit generous across the board.

The game's visuals is a faithful reflection of the anime's aesthetics, bringing characters and environments to video game form.\r\nGameplay within DanMachi BATTLE CHRONICLE revolves around real-time combat, where players engage in dynamic battles against an array of adversaries. The game adopts a popular character-switching system, enabling players to seamlessly alternate between up to three adventurers during battles. Each adventurer possesses distinct skills, strengths, and weaknesses, encouraging strategic team compositions.\r\nRegarding the characters, the game features two sets of character types: Adventurers and an Assist character class. Adventurers are the main combatants of your party, and you can select up to three to seamlessly switch during battles. Each Adventurer has their own set of skills and abilities, as well as strengths and weaknesses against different types of enemies.\r\nIn terms of the actual combat, it feels a bit clunky and stiff. The controls were quite unresponsive, particularly when executing abilities and switching characters. Additionally, the absence of a natural target lock or aim assist feature was a very jarring experience. All aiming had to be done manually using the left stick or by standing still.\r\nFor newcomers, the game does a decent job of retelling the story, although having some prior knowledge of the anime/manga is still recommended. Gameplay-wise, the tutorial makes the game beginner friendly. The game provides helpful tips and guides, ranging from genuinely informative loading screens to comprehensive training missions that unlock as players progress through the first few hours. As for the gacha rolls, the first one offers free infinite reroll tries, which is perfect for those targeting specific characters and who would normally reset the entire progression manually again and again to get what they want.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6197487) Originally posted on TapTap.",

In this game, players immerse themselves in the fantasy world of Orario, where mythological gods, mighty adventurers, and powerful monsters coexist. The game draws heavily from the anime's universe, featuring characters and elements from the series.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful to the story and characters\r\n- Really informative tutorials and training missions\r\n- Infinite reroll for the first gacha pull## Cons\r\n- Stiff and unresponsive controls\r\n- No target lock or aim assist while moving\r\n- Imbalanced skills and abilities\r\n- Not much content outside the main story, some are even tagged as “Coming Soon”\r\n- Stingy gacha rates and monetization methods\r\nThe game's central narrative follows the journey of Bell Cranel over the course of the Anime, an ambitious young adventurer who strives to prove his capabilities and become stronger. As players progress through the game, they follow Bell's evolution from an inexperienced novice to a formidable warrior, and the waifu girls he meets along the way.\r\nGameplay in DanMachi BATTLE CHRONICLE is characterized by its Action RPG combat, reminiscent of traditional mobile ARPGs like in Genshin Impact, albeit not in open world and instead features instanced levels and dungeons to clear with the real-time combat. The game adopts a popular character-switching system, enabling players to seamlessly alternate between up to three adventurers during battles. Each adventurer possesses distinct skills, strengths, and weaknesses, encouraging strategic team compositions.\r\nThe presentation is superb, the graphics adopt a cel-shaded design, common in many anime video game adaptations, and filled with over-the-top anime action. However, the controls tell another story. They feel a bit stiff; there isn’t a target lock for enemies, so you’d have to manually position yourself toward enemies to land hits. Standing still partially solves this problem and results in an assisted aim, but I would have liked a forced target lock feature even while moving, just like in a normal game.\r\nMany attack commands aren’t very responsive; I often found myself locked into animations and attacks, especially when using abilities and character switches, experiencing what feels like a noticeable input delay. There’s a dodge move to evade enemies, but the cooldown takes forever for it to be reliable. The attacks from mobs and bosses are timed frequently, making it almost impossible to avoid them consistently without playing ultra defensively.\r\nRegarding the characters, the game features two sets of character types: Adventurers and an Assist character class. Adventurers are the main combatants of your party, and you can select up to three to seamlessly switch during battles. Each Adventurer has their own set of skills and abilities, as well as strengths and weaknesses against different types of enemies.\r\nAssist characters are paired with Adventurers and effectively function in a support capacity, influencing the adventurer’s HP, recovery, stats, or damage. The downside of this dual character type system is this effectively doubles the need for proper gacha pulls. Additionally, you need to bring Battle Items like potions and equip Scene Cards to enhance the adventurer’s stats or grant new skills for battle. Players can upgrade their Adventurer, Assist, Battle items, and Scene cards using materials gathered from playing the game, as well as by initiating a limit break to upgrade their maximum levels further .\r\nFor newcomers, the game does a decent job of retelling the story, although having some prior knowledge of the anime/manga is still recommended. Gameplay-wise, the tutorial makes the game beginner friendly. The game provides helpful tips and guides, ranging from genuinely informative loading screens to comprehensive training missions that unlock as players progress through the first few hours. As for the gacha rolls, the first one offers free infinite reroll tries, which is perfect for those targeting specific characters and who would normally reset the entire progression manually again and again to get what they want.\r\nHowever, don’t expect generous gacha rates moving forward. I was able to roll some pretty decent characters (UR, SSR, etc) due to beginner bonuses, but beyond that, there aren't many free-to-play opportunities for acquiring pulls.\r\nOutside the main story — which follows the anime's storyline from the beginning — there isn't much content available. One-third of the game modes menu is locked and tagged as “Coming Soon”. The Familia mode is quite basic, essentially representing the guild component of the game, albeit a clever translation of the Familia concept into game form.\r\nFor PvP, the Arena game mode is essentially a PvE mode, where players race to kill monsters and try to gather more magic stones than others before the timer ends, which only ends in a chaotic cluster hell and laggy gameplay due to all eight players simultaneously unleashing epic skills in such small space.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6197508) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Wayfinder\r\nWayfinder was recently released in paid early access form last August 18, debuting amidst a host of server problems that garnered an initial overwhelmingly negative reaction. More recently, servers have been patched up and the queues have gone from literal hours to just a minute or less. More than a week after its release, I was finally able to personally experience the game and see firsthand what all the fuss is about.\r\nDescribed as a fantasy MMORPG-lite, Wayfinder promises a unique blend of exploration, combat, and character progression. As an MMO-lite, it offers player interaction within a shared world while not fully immersing players in a traditional full blown open-world MMO environment. At its core, players engage in a series of missions called Expeditions, pursuing character and weapon level-ups. The central goal involves searching for specific loot to craft items and enhance their character(called Wayfinder)’s power, creating a gameplay cycle of progression.\r\nThe story follows your character as a central hero who sacrificed himself/herself to buy time for others to defeat the enemy and push back the Gloom. A year later, you were brought back from apparent death and chosen by the people to become a Wayfinder, someone who can traverse the Lost Zones to help them study, control, and harness the Gloom.\r\nThe art style of Wayfinder strikes a balance between realism and a stylized, cartoony approach reminiscent of games like Fortnite or World of Warcraft. This fusion results in vibrantly colored characters, creatures, and landscapes that are all visually appealing and evoke a sense of wonder. The slightly stylized characters stand out with their unique designs, making them easily recognizable and memorable.\r\nDrawing inspiration from modern action RPGs, the combat feels like a casual version of Dark Souls put into a Fortnite/WoW graphics filter, incorporating elements of hack and slash third person action with dodging and activated abilities. I thought the combat and animations were funky at first judging from the first gameplay footage that I’ve watched, but it's actually kind of fluid and designed well when I finally played it, even in using Keyboard and Mouse. Controller support is also present, as the game is also available on Console.\r\nAs of now, the game boasts six playable characters, the initial trio of characters comprises: Niss: A Rogue who specializes in melee DPS and boasts fast mobility. Often likened to an \"Engineer\" class, Silo adds a medium level of complexity to the game with her versatile skillset of crowd control abilites and gadgets. Wingrave, a Paladin character can either take on a tanking role or provide support to the team.\r\nThe remaining three characters, Senja, Kyros, and Venomess, are locked initially but can be unlocked through in-game progression or by purchasing them using the currency Runesilvers. Characters in Wayfinder belong to different archetypes, such as Warmaster, Arcanist, and Survivalist, offering players a variety of gameplay styles to choose from.\r\nThe aforementioned Expeditions system plays a central role in the gameplay experience, offering a dynamic way to progress through the game world and acquire valuable resources. With up to three players per run, Expeditions — also known as Lost Zones — are essentially procedurally instanced dungeons that are vital for both advancing the storyline and leveling up your character. These unique and diverse zones are an integral part of the core gameplay loop, providing opportunities for exploration, combat, and loot acquisition.\r\nOne of the core elements of progression in Wayfinder is the leveling of both your Wayfinder characters and their equipped weapons. As you level up, your characters' power rating increases, affecting their overall performance in combat and other in-game activities. By investing Affinity Points, players can enhance specific attributes on their equipped items. The Affinity system consists of three types: Instinct, Discipline, and Focus. Upgrading affinities can lead to significant increases in power for specific stats, allowing players to tailor their characters to their preferred playstyle.\r\nEchoes are items that drop from enemies and provide valuable stats, bonuses, or passives. They can be slotted into your characters, weapons, and accessories, allowing for deep customization and optimization of your character's abilities and attributes. By fusing multiple echoes, players can upgrade their favorite echoes to synergies and to further increase their power.\r\nNow as interesting as the game is, Wayfinder made its entry into the gaming scene through a controversial paid early access phase (not to mention the initial massive server problems). This came with a range of pricing options, including a base package and higher-tier \"Founders Packs\" that offered various bonuses and perks. While these packs provide players with additional content and in-game rewards, they also raised concerns within the community due to their high price points and offering at such an early access stage. The ability to purchase characters and weapons directly also makes the game a bit P2W in this manner, although there are in-app items purchases that are just cosmetics.\r\nIt’s a bit disappointing that they require a $20 minimum just to participate in the Early Access, for a game that is planned to be released completely as a free to play game in six months time. This is a totally unorthodox approach to introduce your game, instead of the usually free Open Beta Tests that lasts for months, eventually leading to a free to play release. As an early access game, I've encountered a host of issues that are normal for this stage of development. Performance can be a bit stuttery at times, especially when traversing to new segments. Loading times are also longer than I'd prefer. However besides these, the game in general feels very polished and appears to be well into its development cycle. There is voice acting for some of the important story dialogues, and the game already comes with tutorials that are actually informative and plentiful.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6212997) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Rainbow Six Mobile\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nFrom the highly popular Rainbow Six franchise, Rainbow Six Mobile is a free-to-play competitive, multiplayer first-person shooter experience tailor made for mobile phones, which has now been soft launched in a limited capacity.  It is now available in Canada for both iOS and Android, while the Soft Launch for other countries will go live starting with Mexico on September 4, with more coming next month.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Intense team-based PvP gameplay\r\n- Tactical depth with variety of operators to choose from\r\n- Destructible Environments\r\n- Straightforward operation progression system\r\n- Responsive and customizable controls\r\n## Cons\r\n- Stability and network issues\r\nRainbow Six Mobile features the same PvP FPS experience that started with Rainbow Six Siege back in 2015, which has continuously been updated throughout the years with new content, operators, and changes.\r\nWhile many gameplay elements, mechanics, and maps look the same, Rainbow Six Mobile is not simply a 1:1 port of Rainbow Six Siege with touch controls, but rather a proper adaptation of the formula to the mobile platform. It features a more vibrant and clean looking graphics — for the dual purpose of toning down the graphics for phones, while at the same time making them more appealing to the mobile gaming market. The graphics are still impressive nonetheless, featuring console-like visuals with smooth performance to go along with it. With my Snapdragon 888 device reaching up to 60fps ranges.However, the network performance and general stability is another story. Constant disconnections, rubber banding, and crashing are things I have already experienced even during my first few hours of play.\r\nMechanically, Rainbow Six Mobile is a unique FPS game with distinct features that differentiate it from the oversaturated battle royale market that we currently have. It is a team-based PvP shooter, with a focus on player abilities, verticality, and destructible environments.\r\nThe game is simply intense, it is very competitive, the shooting feels like Call of Duty, but the feeling that the enemy could come from anywhere, anytime with its destructible environments and dynamic objectives is unparalleled. The hero shooter game mechanics with the different operators and abilities are also similar to Valorant/MOBA games because you have different classes and roles that compliment/counter each other\r\nThere are two game modes in the soft launch, which focuses the game on two key components: Team Deathmatch, which is a straightforward frags game mode, and the Random game mode, which is an objective based match which revolves around Attacking and Defending key areas of the map. They game currently features four maps so far that will be familiar to R6S fans: Bank, Border, Clubhouse and Oregon.\r\nIt’s not that noticeable due to the competency of bots, but there are plenty of bots in my early matches, however this will change as the game releases in more regions and picks up more players.\r\nThe two sides are pretty different from each other in how it plays, leading to a dynamic and engaging experience all match long. As the attacker, players must find the randomly spawning objective first by using drones, before actual deployment, then proceed to systematically enter and breach the location in whatever approach they want. As the defender, players must first set up defense, barricade entry points, hunt for drones, before the enemies can deploy.\r\nThe destructible environments are the heart of Rainbow Six Mobile's gameplay, Walls, floors, and ceilings can be destroyed, allowing players to create new paths, sightlines, and unexpected strategies. Each round is a dynamic puzzle, where both attackers and defenders must adapt to changing circumstances, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.\r\nRainbow Six Mobile boasts a diverse roster of operators, each with their own special abilities and gadgets. From hard breachers and gadget counters to intel gatherers and team support, the operators offer a wealth of tactical options. These operators are all unlockable via in-game grinding, so far the process is decently implemented, with a ticket system allowing players to try out these operators, one ticket at a time, until they eventually “recruit” them permanently to their rotation.\r\nAlthough unlocks and progression can only be made once the operator is recruited, which adds an additional layer of grind. Players can also spend real money to buy platinum coins, which costs around $20 for 2-3 operators, with also options to purchase cosmetics for their operators. For this soft launch, progression will finally be made permanent going into the full launch, so no more wipes or restarts as far as players are concerned.\r\nThe controls are very typical of touch-based FPS games, but feature more buttons than a traditional one due to the use of gadgets, left and right leaning, and additional commands such as rappelling down walls or using security cameras. For the most part, the controls are still easy to learn and not as overwhelming as I expected, but I felt that the placement of some of the buttons could use a little bit of tweaking – fortunately made possible by the customizable HUD elements. Sadly, there is no physical controller support as of now, when I tested with my Xbox controller.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6223508) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game features a variety of anthropomorphic animals with unique looks engaging in chaotic and fun-filled battles.\r\nThe game is scheduled to be released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox on September 20, 2023, while a three-part closed beta testing is being conducted leading up to the release: September 1 to 3, September 8 to 10, and September 15 to 19. Unfortunately I was not able to get access to the first closed beta, but of course we can thank TapTap themselves for streaming the closed beta gameplay live during its launch.\r\nstreaming the closed beta gameplay live during its launch.\r\nThe entire gameplay setup is quite similar to physics-based brawler games like Gang Beasts and Gummy Life. You choose your character from a list of amusingly designed characters, which are cute anthropomorphic animals this time, and engage in various brawl-based game modes.\r\nThe core of the game is physics-based combat, where players can engage in melee combat with other players. You can punch, toss, jump, kick, and headbutt opponents, all while taking advantage of the physics engine to create chaotic and hilarious battles.\r\nFor the art style that the game aims for, the graphics are insanely overdetailed. Party Animals easily stands out in terms of graphics and art style due to its incredible attention to detail, realistic fur rendering, well-executed motion blur, and impressive lighting effects.\r\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, I can see that it already looks more kinetic and alive than Gang Beasts. The animations are fluid, fast, and look responsive, yet still maintain a chaotic quality, which means chaotic fun. Of course, this game brings something new to the table by introducing usable weapons with actual melee moves and ranged attacks, and by placing more importance on interactiables throughout the maps.\r\nThe game also features not just an elimination game mode like its contemporaries, but a host of other game modes as well:\r\nLast Stand:  This is a traditional free-for-all skirmish mode where the goal is to be the last animal standing. Team Score:  A mode that involves teamwork and sports-like gameplay. Players compete by dragging a large object (like an ice puck) around the map and scoring goals against each other. Arcade Mode:  This mode offers a collection of random game modes and rules, providing a wide range of challenges and scenarios.\r\nOn the TapTap live stream, one of the highlights are the two teams battling it out while dragging a huge ice puck around the map, scoring goals against each other. Arcade mode is what truly lives up to the game's \"Party\" in the title and positions it as a contender for the best physics-based brawler title.\r\nTapTap live stream\r\nCan this cute challenger dethrone the OG, Gang Beasts? It certainly seems poised to do so when it finally releases on September 20, on both Xbox and PC (Steam).\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6237764) Originally posted on TapTap.",

They can explore various planets, space stations, and engage in a wide range of activities, including branching dialogues with NPCs, skill checks, side quests, looting items, and more. The game allows players to customize their characters and their own ships, which serve as a central element of the game's customization.\r\nGraphics and Overall Art:\r\nStarfield has an overall impressive graphics and a world that feels alive. The highly detailed graphics and magnificent soundtrack contribute to a sense of immersion, wonder, and believability within the game's universe.\r\nSpace Travel: Players can own and pilot their own ships, explore space, and even engage in space combat with customizable ships that serve as extensions of their characters.\r\nPlanetary Surface Exploration and Outpost Building: Similar to Fallout's settlement system and No Man's Sky's planetary exploration, players can establish outposts on unexplored planets -- over a thousand of them --- scan for lifeforms and points of interest, and extract resources. Outposts can be linked to establish trade routes, and both ships and outposts can be manned by recruited crew members.\r\nCharacter Customization: Starfield allows for extensive character customization, including backgrounds, traits, and skills that can impact gameplay.\r\nSkill Progression: The game features a skill progression system where players earn skill points to unlock new abilities and can further enhance those skills by completing associated challenges.\r\nTen years later, I can see this still being played by thousands, perhaps millions of players (add me to the list) just like Skyrim, Fallout, and Oblivion before it. So far? I'm very impressed by this game, and even more excited for the modding community to do its thing.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6234801) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Well, to avoid any confusion with the similarly titled upcoming game Sword of Convallaria, Shadow Under Convallaria is actually a limited-time event for Aether Gazer Global, following the previous update last month “Where the Butterfly Belongs”.\r\nThe update includes a new chapter in the main story, Chapter 10, eponymously named \"Shadow Under Convallaria.\" Completing normal and hard stages of this chapter will reward players with Shifted Stars. Players can challenge the Chapter 10 Normal stages without having to complete the preceding stages during the 'Shadow Under Convallaria' event, which is neat for those who want to skip right to the event. When the event ends, players will need to complete the previous main story stages to unlock Chapter 10.\r\nHowever, the most awaited aspect of this update is the introduction of Hades to the game via the Muses Tea Party Scan. Players can also experience and learn the basic operations of the units during the trial. Thanks to the CN version which is about a year ahead in terms of content, we now know that Hades is considered one of the top-tier units in the game, alongside Hera and Hel.\r\nAether Gazer is currently under maintenance as of writing but is expected to go live later on September 5th at 15:00 (UTC-7) and will run until October 10th.

This means that there's a window of opportunity to participate and reap its rewards.\r\nChapter 10 - Shadow Under Convallaria:\r\nChapter 10 - Shadow Under Convallaria:\r\nThe update includes a new chapter in the main story, Chapter 10, eponymously named \"Shadow Under Convallaria.\" Completing normal and hard stages of this chapter will reward players with Shifted Stars.\r\nAether Gazer players will be delighted to learn that they can challenge Chapter 10's Normal stages without the need to complete the preceding chapters during the \"Shadow Under Convallaria\" event. This accessibility ensures that everyone that is at least level 30* can dive straight into the action. When the event ends, players will still need to complete the previous main story stages to unlock Chapter 10. As players embark on this epic adventure, they'll find themselves immersed in a voiced narrative filled with twists and turns.\r\nUnlocking Hard Stages:\r\nUnlocking Hard Stages:\r\nFor those seeking a more challenging experience, the Hard stages in Chapter 10 are also available. However, there's a prerequisite: players must first clear Chapter 9 on Hard Mode. Once the event concludes, players will need to complete previous main story stages to unlock Chapter 10.\r\nThe Puppet Show has begun! - Meet Hades\r\nThe Puppet Show has begun! - Meet Hades\r\nOne of the most eagerly anticipated aspects of this update is the introduction of Hades. Players will have the opportunity to experience Hades firsthand and learn the basic operations of the Modifiers during the trial. Thanks to the CN version which is about a year ahead in terms of content, Hades has earned a reputation as one of the top-tier units in the game, joining the ranks of Hera and Hel. Joining Hades as new content are three more units as part of the Muses Tea Party\" Precise Scan:\r\nS-Grade Modifier: Puppet Master - Hades\r\nA-Grade Modifiers: Drowsie - Oneiroi, Radiant Feather - Hera, Shinku - Buzenbo Tengu\r\nPlayers can catch a glimpse of what's to come by looking at the Chinese (CN) version of the game, which typically enjoys a content lead of about a year. This allows players to plan their strategies and prioritize characters based on their performance in the CN version. It's a valuable tool for making informed decisions in a fast-paced gacha environment.\r\nSigils are an essential part of Aether Gazer's gameplay, and \"Shadow Under Convallaria\" introduces two new sigils with unique effects:\r\nAcheron's Obol (3-set effects): This sigil increases your ATK when Divine Grace is gained in battle, stacking up to 3 times. Additionally, when spending Divine Grace, your Crit DMG is boosted for a limited time, with stacking potential.\r\nFeather of the Pacifier (3-set effects): This sigil empowers your ATK and enhances your Rage gain rate when Rage is spent in battle, with stacking effects.\r\nFor those hungry for more lore and adventures, the Red & Green event story will be permanently archived in the Side Story. Administrators who have completed this story in the \"Red & Green\" Limited-Time Event can experience it again and claim rewards.\r\nThere are tons of more content coming in the second half of the event, such as the Dance Battle, Scrolls in the Dream, Storm and Farce, and Autumn Fortune. Each with their gimmicks and rewards. For example,  In Dance Battle, Players earn points by eliminating incoming enemies, and the stage rewards are determined by the highest score achieved.  Rewards for this event include 400 Shifted Stars, Sigil Module T3, and more.\r\nAether Gazer's update model is characterized by frequent character releases, occurring approximately every 2-3 weeks. Players often strategize and save their in-game currency for characters they desire, and this update is looking to be the PRIME opportunity to splurge on pulls.\r\nShadow Under Convallaria is an exciting addition to Aether Gazer, extending the narrative, adding new challenges, and finally bringing in the highly anticipated Hades. While the game's pace of character releases may seem fast, savvy players always plan their pulls carefully to maximize their gaming experience. If you're a fan of Aether Gazer’s either expansive narrative or perhaps its action-packed hack and slash style of gameplay, this update is not to be missed.\r\nEvent Date:\r\nThe game is now LIVE starting today and will run until October 10th. It's divided into two parts: Part I (September 5th to September 19th) and Part II (September 19th to October 10th). To participate in the event, you need to reach level 30 or above.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6250426) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players explore a fantasy world, collect endless loot, and customize heroes with unique skills and legendary gear. In addition, it features fine graphics and smooth performance, making it one of the better ARPG options on mobile today.\r\nAs a live service game, Torchlight Infinite has received numerous updates and seasonal content throughout the past year since its release, and the latest upcoming season: The City of Aeterna is set to bring new exciting content and balance changes to the game.\r\nSimply put, The City of Aeterna, dubbed as “The Lost City”, is a new and significant gameplay addition in Torchlight Infinite, introduced as part of the game's \"The City of Aeterna\" season. Players can access the city by collecting enough \"Mark of the Ruins\" fragments and overlaying them on the Aeterna Map.\r\nWithin The City of Aeterna, players can defeat monsters to gain Energy. Collecting a certain amount of Energy rewards Kindling which grants seasonal rewards when offered to the Sacrificial Bonfire. As players progress the Bonfires, they have the opportunity to challenge the boss of The City of Aeterna: The Lone King of Aeterna, varying levels of difficulty. The more Bonfires collected, the better the rewards from defeating the boss.\r\nAdditionally, there is a First Kill event in place for The Lone King of Aeterna and the top ten players in each server (AS, EU, NA) and for each Hero Trait will receive 500 Primocrysts. Additionally, these top ten players will receive an exclusive event Avatar. Those who complete the challenge but don't reach the top ten rankings will still earn a smaller reward of 100 Primocrysts, which is still a nice bonus for participating in an otherwise fun upcoming Season.\r\nSome of the other contents and features included in Torchlight Infinite's \"The City of Aeterna,\" which goes live on September 7, 2023 includes a Redesigned Crafting System, and Forsaken: Iris, a new hero with unique abilities related to the Spirit Magus, plus the extreme Flame of Pleasure trait for Frostfire: Gemma.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6247874) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It takes a lot of inspirations from other genres too, mixing rogue-lite elements, battle royale mechanics, and even Pokemon style of capturing and commanding powerful Nano creatures. SYNCED is set to release on September 8 for PC, Xbox, and Playstation systems.\r\n## Pros\r\n## Pros\r\n- Satisfying FPS combat mechanics\r\n- Incredibly detailed graphics that incorporate advanced features like RTX and DLSS\r\n- Rogue-lite elements with random upgrades, bringing freshness to every session\r\n- Runs and missions get preserved in the case of disconnecting or quitting the game\r\n- Consistently thrilling and frantically action-packed PvPvE game mode## Cons\r\n## Cons\r\n-Expect stutters even if you can run the game well\r\n-Unbalanced runners and Nanos, the offensive types are preferable for both solo and team play while the utility/defense based types only excels in team play.\r\nSYNCED's narrative backdrop sets the stage in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is grappling with the aftermath of advanced nanomachines gone rogue. These nanos have transformed most humans into zombie-like creatures, creating a dystopian landscape that's as intriguing as it is terrifying. The game's world-building is immersive, but the initial exposition dump could be more elegantly presented. The tutorial however is very cleanly made and I loved the overall introduction of the gameplay mechanics. It doesn’t overwhelm the player and it only introduces what is needed, and lets the player have fun as early as you start the game.\r\nPlayers take on the role of Runners, survivors who have banded together in a resistance called Haven. The Haven serves as the player's home base and a hub for various activities, including upgrading weapons, adding attachments, and customizing characters. The game offers a small roster of pre-made Runners, each with their unique personalities, skills, and abilities, catering to different playstyles.\r\nGraphics and Performance:\r\nGraphics and Performance:\r\nPowered by Unreal Engine, SYNCED boasts incredibly detailed graphics that incorporate advanced features like Ray Tracing, DLSS, and even the latest Frame Gen. When it comes to visual quality, this game is truly exceptional and rivals even AAA titles that cost $70, despite SYNCED being a free to play game. The game is relatively light to run, performing around 100+FPS on my 8700k and RTX 3080 setup. However expect some occasional stutters when moving around the semi-open world map and the game streams more data.\r\nSYNCED's core gameplay revolves around missions where players venture into the semi-open world to clear out increasingly challenging segments that are infested with nano creatures. It somehow also feels like a zombie survival shooter with how the hordes of Nano creatures are coming right at you. These missions culminate in intense boss fights that require teamwork, strategy, and coordination when in team-based mode, but the game is also viable when played Solo, such is my experience for the majority of my PVE playthrough.\r\nWhile in the open-world, Players can \"Sync\" with defeated low-level bosses to create Nano companions or use them as gauntlet enhancements when it's on you instead of as a companion. It's akin to the Pokémon concept but only one Nano creature at a time.\r\nAdditionally, the game incorporates rogue-lite elements, allowing players to unlock temporary skill upgrades and modifiers for temporary currency, enhancing the variety and freshness of every session. The upgrades aren't all interesting, and even after reading all of them thoroughly, I noticed that half of them didn't make a noticeable difference in my runs. However, some are indeed powerful, such as the upgrade that automatically spawns an exploding ball on top of every mob I kill, or throws a grenade whenever I reload from zero bullets.\r\nThe sense of progression and the dynamic objectives in the semi-open world keep the gameplay engaging. The game is only playable online, but I love how runs and missions are preserved even when quitting or disconnecting. You don’t have to repeat the run back from the start and instead resume from frequent checkpoints. It’s really like a singleplayer game in that regard.\r\nPvP Gameplay\r\nPvP Gameplay\r\nThat was just one half of the game; the other half primarily focuses on PvP, with a dash of PvE action. Challenge rival Runners in intense PvP battles on a semi-open map, all while surviving against hostile Nano creatures. Enhance your Runner, weapons, and even your Companion Nanos during each run in a rogue-lite manner to gain the upper hand. Fortunately even with the limited number of players at the moment, I was able to queue up with other players and was able to experience the PvP first hand.\r\nEach team or player races to gather Nerva across the map, and the team with the most Nerva wins when the timer runs out. Towards the end, there's a touch of control point domination-style gameplay where you must secure your extraction point from others, reminiscent of how Plunder works in Call of Duty: Warzone. The entire gameplay experience is consistently thrilling and frantically action-packed from start to finish.\r\nSYNCED shines in the FPS combat department. It’s not as clunky as you would expect, the gunplay feels top-notch, reminiscent of AAA titles and even better with the added mobility powers like the enhanced leaping or dodge moves. In addition, controller support is already well-implemented. The melee combat is equally enjoyable, offering a light hack-and-slash-style experience enhanced by Nano abilities. The sound design, especially the metallic effects when battling nano creatures, is a gratifying departure from typical zombie games but still as equally effective in.\r\nSYNCED is set as a free-to-play game with microtransactions, but so far everything I’ve seen are character cosmetics, weapon skins,  or unlocking some of the characters without any pay-to-win mechanics in place, which bodes well for the overall balancing and progression of the game.\r\nSome Downsides\r\nSome Downsides\r\nWhile SYNCED has much to offer, it's not without its drawbacks. The balance between offensive and utility/defense-based Runners and Nanos may need adjustment, as offensive types seem preferable for both solo and team play, while the utility/defense-based feels weak if played in solo.\r\nSYNCED's gameplay, while engaging, might feel familiar to fans of the looter shooter genre, and some players may find the repetitive nature of clearing missions and battling bosses somewhat tiring. Still, for looter shooters, it largely keeps the same gameplay formula and adds its own interesting twists that I feel is adequate enough to stand out amongst the rest.\r\nSYNCED has the foundation to carve out its own space in the shooter looter landscape, especially with its non-existent price of admission of zero dollars, but whether it can fend off the competition from other live-service games remains to be seen. For now, it's a promising addition to the looter shooter genre, offering hours of cooperative and competitive fun for players willing to venture into its pokemon rogue-lite nanotech FPS nightmare, when it comes out on September 8.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6252507) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is a part-compilation, part remaster gacha game that beautifully blends elements from the original 1997 release and the more recent FF7 spin-offs and remakes.\r\nThe game features both charming Chibi-style character designs for the story segments while incorporating the modern ultra-detailed graphics of the recent games during combat sequences. So far it achieves a nice balance of the two styles,\r\nAs for the combat, Ever Crisis retains the turn-based combat system from the original Final Fantasy VII. The Active Time Battle (ATB) system returns, allowing players to interrupt an opponent's turn to execute skills and magic.  It pays homage to the original while adding a layer of strategy to battles. Of course, as a gacha game, you can automate and fast forward the combat.\r\nA lot of the game modes are unlocked early on, including the three main stories (FF7, Crisis Core, and First Soldier), but the difficulty is a bit steep when it comes to meeting the necessary power levels, which are part of the aggressive gacha mechanics of the game.\r\nAlmost every aspect of the game seems monetized, making it feel like free-to-play gaming at its most aggressive. Shame, because the actual combat and story is actually done really well and encapsulates the entire FF7 saga in a neat and fun way. Money won’t solve everything though, as Ever Crisis releases its story content in monthly installments, which would still require players to wait for more content.\r\nStill, if you're a big fan of Final Fantasy VII, it's worth downloading and trying out—provided that you are located in one of the supported regions. Ever Crisis doesn't seem to support all regions, particularly in SEA countries, requiring the use of a VPN. Players in those countries can try using a VPN for the UK or US region to see if the game will connect.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6260840) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "FINAL FANTASY VII EVER CRISIS\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nGet\r\nFinal Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is a gacha mobile RPG that attempts to bridge the gap between nostalgia and mobile gaming. Developed by Applibot and published by Square Enix, it delves into the rich world of Final Fantasy VII, encapsulating the original game, its spin-offs, and even an original storyline.\r\nWhile this is a global release, Ever Crisis doesn't seem to support all regions, particularly in SEA countries, requiring the use of a VPN. Players in those countries can try using a VPN for the UK or US region to see if the game will connect.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nEver Crisis beautifully blends elements from the original 1997 release and the more recent remake. During non-combat story segments, the game pays homage to the classic with charming chibi-style character designs. These characters are still detailed and charming, capturing the essence of the original game while offering a fresh perspective. This approach is largely the same and consistent for other newer titles as well such as Crisis Core.\r\nThe real visual spectacle, however, emerges during the actual turn-based combat. Ever Crisis boasts highly detailed CGI-like graphics that can rival current-gen consoles. When I first saw it, I actually thought it was a cutscene, but then it was in fact actual gameplay. The transition from story to combat graphics can be a bit jarring at times, but you get used to it after a while.\r\n## 📖Story\r\n## 📖Story\r\nEver Crisis ambitiously draws from all existing Final Fantasy VII lore, encompassing the original game, Crisis Core, and an original story. More FF7 games like Dirge of Cerberus are also planned to be added along the way. It's a comprehensive effort to create a cohesive narrative that fans can appreciate. While not every plot element made it into the game, it does an admirable job of capturing the major events.\r\nIn addition to revisiting familiar storylines, Ever Crisis introduces an original story based on the now-defunct The First Soldier battle royale, offering players an early perspective on the Final Fantasy VII saga. This storyline focuses on a team of SOLDIER candidates and explores the origins of the legendary hero Sephiroth. This storyline is actually a big deal and it’s surprising that it’s being told in a gacha game format.\r\nThe variety of game modes, including the three main stories (FF7, Crisis Core, and First Soldier), provides players with a wealth of content to explore. However, the monthly installment release schedule for the story content can be frustrating for those eager to consume it all at once.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nEver Crisis retains the turn-based combat system from the original Final Fantasy VII, a decision that will please fans of the classic gameplay. The Active Time Battle (ATB) system returns, allowing players to interrupt an opponent's turn to execute skills and magic. It also eliminates the waiting periods associated with turn-based combat while maintaining a steady pace. It pays homage to the original while adding a layer of strategy to battles. Of course, as a gacha game, you can automate and fast forward the combat.\r\nThe game stories are divided into chapters, each comprising a mix of story segments, combat sequences, exploration gameplay, or a combination of these elements. Whether you're revisiting iconic moments from the original game, exploring new storylines, or trying to upgrade your characters by gathering enough materials and doing daily quests, cooperative missions, and challenges, Ever Crisis offers variety that keeps players invested.\r\n## 💎Microtransactions\r\n## 💎Microtransactions\r\nPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Ever Crisis is its monetization model. The game is free to play, but it heavily relies on gacha mechanics, loot boxes, and battle passes to acquire new weapons, characters, and upgrades. Premium currency is the key to rolling for these in-game items, and it's essential for progression, especially if you want to keep up with recommended power levels in a short amount of time and grind. Self-promoted pop-ups intrude the players at every opportunity and players may feel pressured to spend real money on premium currency. Stamina, necessary for solo content missions, depletes and requires waiting for it to refill or paying cash.\r\nAlmost every aspect of the game seems monetized, making it feel like free-to-play gaming at its most aggressive. Shame, because the actual combat and story is actually done really well and encapsulates the entire FF7 saga in a neat and fun way. Money won’t solve everything though, as Ever Crisis releases its story content in monthly installments, which would still require players to wait for more content.\r\nWhile the gacha system is a common feature in many mobile games, it's blatantly aggressive in Ever Crisis. This can be a huge downside especially for console and PC Final Fantasy fans who may have been hoping for a more traditional premium Final Fantasy experience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nFinal Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is a mobile RPG that walks the shaky line between nostalgia and modern monetization methods. It's a great middle ground between the original and remake style of storytelling and graphics. In fact, some might even prefer this approach to remaking FFVII in terms of gameplay and visual style, but it leans too heavily on the mobile gaming gacha aspects, making it a challenging game to get into for console and PC Final Fantasy fans.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6261035) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "eFootball™Global\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\nThe Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) game series — also previously known as Winning Eleven in some regions — has certainly come a long way. From its PlayStation “Goal Storm” roots to its rebranding into the now-fledgling free-to-play game eFootball, and now with its newest yearly iteration: eFootball 2024. Whether that journey has been for better or worse, well, I'd let my review speak for itself.\r\nWhile the base game is free-to-play, eFootball 2024 generates revenue through microtransactions. Players have the option to spend real money within the game to purchase various in-game items and content.\r\n## 🎨 Graphics\r\n## 🎨 Graphics\r\nVisually, the UI is sleek, vibrant, and easy to navigate. Largely similar to previous recent eFootball iterations, it just feels like an extension of your phone with its large icons and easy-to-read text. On the other hand, the graphics of the mobile version that I played have always taken a deep dive compared to the photorealistic console and PC counterparts, but they still look decent, especially when everything is zoomed out and the graphics are set to 'High' settings. Overall, I am satisfied with the visual quality of both the menu design and in-game graphics.\r\n## 📺 Presentation\r\n## 📺 Presentation\r\nAs for the presentation, the players' likenesses are adequately recreated, and their movements on the field are fluid and lifelike, with animations that dynamically react to the current situation. The way the ball moves, bounces, and interacts with players' feet feels natural and responsive. The stadium environments are visually appealing as well, contributing to the immersive experience. In fact, I find the animations in eFootball more appealing than those in EA Sports FC Mobile.\r\n## 🎮 Controls\r\n## 🎮 Controls\r\nAgain comparing it to its mortal rival, the also recently rebranded EA Sports FC Mobile (formerly FIFA), which feels more arcade-like in terms of gameplay, eFootball 2024 presents a more realistic gameplay experience overall. However, this realism can sometimes work to its detriment, as the gameplay proves to be very challenging to control. Controlling players feels weighty and unresponsive, and it's often difficult to direct them precisely as you want. Passes and shots often miss badly and the movement feels weighty. For the control scheme, the game offers two sets: Touch and Flick, a UI-less system based on gestures only, and Classic, a traditional virtual gamepad setup. Unfortunately, both of these control schemes suffer from responsiveness issues. I tried connecting my Xbox controller, and it was unfortunately not compatible, which is disappointing considering this game is available on PC and Consoles.\r\n## 📜 Game Modes\r\n## 📜 Game Modes\r\nIn eFootball 2024, you have two ways to play football matches: Authentic Team and Dream Team. Authentic is the traditional football game mode where you can select any current roster and pit them against each other, play with friends, or go offline versus AI. Notably, this mode is completely separate from the free-to-play model of the game, but its not truly offline, as it still requires an online connection.\r\nAuthentic Team definitely reminded me of the good old straightforward football games devoid of microtransactions. However, it lacks extensive content. There's no Career mode, Become a Legend, or Master League (that was promised to come), and the progression is rather limited, mainly revolving around playing quick five to ten minute matches to satisfy your football cravings on-the-go.\r\nOn the other hand, the Dream Team mode is the primary focus of the game. I mostly played the Offline game mode from Authentic Team and the eFootball League from the Dream Team, which essentially serves as the ranked PvP mode of the game. The gameplay can be quite challenging, particularly due to the unresponsive controls and the shortened game length of only five to ten minutes. However, there is still some fun to be had.\r\nThe game initially matches you against bots in the starting division and gradually introduces you to other players as opponents. The matchmaking takes a while to find other players and the server performance isn’t top-notch. However, for those that could play, playing matches will earn you experience to level up your team and provide opportunities for customization. It's worth noting that certain premium teams and individual players may be locked behind paywalls.\r\nPlayers can choose to purchase these teams or players to enhance their roster in the game. eFootball 2024 also includes gacha-style mechanics, where players spend in-game currency or real money to acquire randomized players or items.\r\neFootball 2024 also offers match passes, which provide additional content and rewards for a limited time. Players can purchase these passes to access exclusive challenges, cosmetics, and other in-game benefits. The game also has an in-game currency that can be bought with real money. This currency can be used to acquire various in-game items and speed up progress.\r\nWhile the game is ultimately free, unlike older titles in the series, It's important for players to be aware of the microtransactions and the potential costs associated with eFootball's free-to-play model. I still miss the old model of a one-time purchase and a focus on singleplayer content, such as managing your Career as a player or managing a club.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion:\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion:\r\neFootball 2024 offers an impressive soccer simulation experience for mobile devices, with lifelike and dynamic animations providing an immersive gameplay experience. Fans of the sport can play a decent soccer game on-the-go with its pseudo-offline mode, but the free-to-play model definitely did more harm than good by removing much of the singleplayer and premium aspects of the previous titles and replacing it with an aggressive pay-to-win scheme that not everyone will appreciate.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6257269) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The base game is free-to-play, but eFootball 2024 generates revenue through microtransactions. Players have the option to spend real money within the game to purchase various in-game items and content.\r\nThe game offers a pretty realistic simulation of soccer, with attention to player movements, ball physics, and tactical depth. I played the mobile version in which the graphics have always taken a deep dive compared to the photorealistic console and PC counterparts, but they still look decent, especially when everything is zoomed out and the graphics are set to 'High' settings.\r\nSpeaking of content, it looks like it has also continued its deep dive further. It features two core modes: Authentic Team and Dream Team. Authentic Team is the traditional football game mode where you can select any current roster and pit them against each other, play with friends, or go offline versus AI. Dream Team on the other hand focuses on building your team via grinding, microtransactions, and competing online.\r\nThe game as a whole lacks extensive content. There's no Career mode, Become a Legend, or Master League (that was promised to come this year), and the progression is rather limited, mainly revolving around playing quick five to ten minute matches to satisfy your football cravings on-the-go.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6257220) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "lyndonguitar\r\nGet\r\nTorchlight Infinite: The City of Aeterna is the latest season of Torchlight Infinite, an action-RPG where players can expect fast-paced combat, an abundance of loot, and a range of character customization options. The game features fine graphics and smooth performance, making it one of the better ARPG options on mobile today. The City of Aeterna, dubbed as “The Lost City” is now returning as part of Torchlight Infinite’s latest content update.\r\nWhat I liked about Torchlight Infinite as a whole is that it does not shy away from action-packed and over-the-top explosions and visuals. Even if you just started right away, the visual splendor of combat already feels like end-game levels of fun with the characters mowing down crowds of foes with ease. Of course, it only gets better as you play and unlock more skills to experiment with. That’s not to say there aren't any downsides, as the visual clutter is also its own downfall, not just in the combat, but in the menus as well.\r\n## 📖Story\r\n## 📖Story\r\nAs for the overall premise, Torchlight Infinite places players in the role of a Hunter infected with the supernatural Aember, tasked with battling mutant creatures called Aemberons. The story revolves around partnering with Aria and embarking on a quest to defeat the Aemberon leader, Lean, who has stolen a valuable artifact. The story is largely forgettable, especially once you get going with the combat, which is the main highlight. It is definitely one of the weaker points of the game. My suggestion? But give it a chance if it gets you hooked. If not, just press skip and just follow the waypoints, skip to the good parts.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nAs The City of Aeterna features Seasonal content, it means starting a new character from scratch to access most of the stuff. I chose Frostfire Gemma for my Season playthrough,— a mage class that harnesses special abilities through fire and ice attacks, as I love playing casters in ARPG games. Character movement is controlled with the left thumb, and you can assign up to five skills to the buttons on the right. Attacks typically auto-target, provided the player is facing roughly the direction of the enemy.\r\nThe skill and perk system allows players to tailor their character's skills, modifiers, and power levels. The ability to unlock various upgrades and customize skills with effects adds depth to character development and encourages experimentation. The skill and perk system is an engaging mechanic overall, and one that adds variety and brings much experimentation even if you are only playing a single character.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nTorchlight Infinite has always been known for its vibrant and colorful art style, and The City of Aeterna is no exception. While Infinite is a slight departure to the original Torchlight series graphics with its cel-shaded-esque style, the graphics are still crisp and pleasing to the eye, enhancing the overall immersive experience. The game also runs smoothly, with optimizations for mobile phones and improved controller support (Even showing control schemes from Steam Deck, Xbox, and PlayStation controllers), ensuring that players can enjoy the action however they want.\r\nThe City of Aeterna\r\nThe City of Aeterna\r\nThis expansion brings a bunch of new content to the table. A new hero, skills, end-game component, and legendary gear keep players engaged and striving for more powerful builds. The highlight of the update is the titular The City of Aeterna. Players can access it by collecting enough \"Mark of the Ruins\" fragments and overlaying them on the Aeterna Map.\r\nWithin The City of Aeterna, players can defeat monsters to gain Energy. Collecting a certain amount of Energy rewards Kindling which grants seasonal rewards when offered to the Sacrificial Bonfire. As players progress the Bonfires, they have the opportunity to challenge the boss of The City of Aeterna: The Lone King of Aeterna, varying levels of difficulty. The more Bonfires collected, the better the rewards from defeating the boss. Eventually, you will unlock Infinite City of Aeterna, which functions as an additional endgame content moving forward.\r\nAdditionally, there is a First Kill event in place for The Lone King of Aeterna and the top ten players in each server (AS, EU, NA) and for each Hero Trait will receive 500 Primocrysts. Additionally, these top ten players will receive an exclusive event Avatar. Those who complete the challenge but don't reach the top ten rankings will still earn a smaller reward of 100 Primocrysts, which is still a nice bonus for participating in an otherwise fun Season.\r\nIn addition to the Seasonal content, The City of Aeterna also introduces a new hero Forsaken: Iris, a new hero with unique abilities related to the Spirit Magus, the extreme Flame of Pleasure trait for Frostfire: Gemma.\r\nThe patch also brings a significant overhaul to the crafting system. Players can lock affixes, upgrade affixes with Flame Elementium, and take risks with Ultimate Ember upgrades. The Targeted Processing feature allows for specific affix customization, all while retaining plasticity efficiency. Fine Ember, Precious Ember, Divest Fossil, and Refined Fossil have been removed from crafting, streamlining the crafting process.\r\nConclusion\r\nConclusion\r\nOverall, The new season undoubtedly increases replayability with its new content, both in characters, progression, end-game variety, and in the quality of life changes. It doesn't fundamentally alter the core gameplay loop, which can be a good thing, but may leave long-time players wanting more significant changes.\r\nFor more details about the Season, you can read more about it here in the website’s Patch Notes.\r\nhere in the website’s Patch Notes.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6271918) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With the announcement of POPUCOM, it appears that another promising cooperative gem is on the horizon.\r\nWell, there's no release date yet provided, but judging from the trailer, the game sure looks interesting with its blend of Match-3 color based gameplay, third person shooter, puzzler platformer, and cooperative gameplay. A mix that I've never seen before implemented on such a game. Plus the visuals looks really great with vibrant and playful graphics that resemble traditional ink and paint art styles all mashed and splashed together.\r\nPOPUCOM features split-screen co-op action and will also offer online play. If you watched until the end, it even appears to support up to four players playing cooperatively!\r\nNot much is known aside from the general details, so I'm personally excited to see how they can make the Match-3 color mechanics intuitive and seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, as well as how engaging the color-switching and puzzle-solving mechanics will be for players. If you have a buddy or partner to play it with, it seems like a no-brainer to add this game to the growing list of cooperative titles.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6273211) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Mortal Kombat™ 1\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nGet\r\nMortal Kombat 1 is an upcoming fighting game that serves as both a sequel to Mortal Kombat 11 and a reboot of the series. It features a restarted universe with new origins for the characters and a fresh storyline, set to be released for PC, PS, Xbox, and Switch.\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\nWhen it comes to fighting games, there are three distinct types of players - those who crave for an immersive story… The folks, friends, and families who gather for local multiplayer showdowns… and the competitive souls who venture into the online arena. Well, personally, I fall into the first two categories, and I can confidently say that Mortal Kombat 1 delivers a fatal knockout punch of fun for both camps.\r\n## 📖Story\r\n## 📖Story\r\nThe story is actually surprisingly amazing. Despite being a reboot in most respects, it is still set after the events of Mortal Kombat 11 in a sort of an in-universe reboot. Fire God Liu Kang, who possesses immense power and control over time, creates a new universe, but not everything goes according to plan. Despite his efforts, there are imperfections and threats that emerge within this new reality, which will once again need a group of warriors from different realms.\r\nThe game's clean slate approach breathes new life into beloved characters, offering a refreshing experience for both newcomers and long-time fans. Mortal Kombat 1 masterfully subverts expectations, remixing characters with fresh origins, stories, and designs. Some characters are now more like-able, while others retain the essence of their iconic previous iterations.\r\nThe main campaign only spans around 5-7 hours, but once you start it, you just can’t put it down. It’s THAT Good. It’s one continuous flow of nonstop action, brutality, and a bit of comedy that seamlessly changes from cutscene to fights and back to cutscenes.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nMortal Kombat 1 boasts impressive graphics that capture the franchise's dark and moody aesthetic. Characters are meticulously detailed, and their animations flow smoothly, and that clay-like aesthetic is already bordering on photorealism, which sometimes can result in some uncanny valley moments. Still, it is leaning towards being more impressive than being weird overall. The lightning system and overall shaders used are amazing and it didn’t really look like a traditional Unreal Engine 4 game and looks beyond better than that.\r\nOf course, Mortal Kombat wouldn't be Mortal Kombat without its unapologetic depiction of violence. Hits, blood, gore, and dismemberment are portrayed in a graphic and exaggerated manner during battles and this game is no different from its predecessors, with \"Fatalities\" taking center stage in all their visceral glory.\r\n## ⚔️Gameplay and Kombat\r\n## ⚔️Gameplay and Kombat\r\nAt its core, Mortal Kombat 1 is a 2D perspective fighting game with a focus on one-on-one combat. Players select a character from the diverse roster taken from its rich history, each with their unique abilities and playstyles. The game features a traditional fighting game setup with rounds, health bars, and a timer. Mortal Kombat's signature combo-heavy gameplay shines through, with controls finely tuned to accommodate intricate attack sequences.\r\nMortal Kombat 1 features the aforementioned Story Mode, Invasion Mode, online multiplayer (with rollback netcode), and an in-game store for microtransactions. Invasion mode is a brand-new addition to the series that is essentially a single player RPG-style board game / dungeon crawler featuring challenges, quests, and traditional Mortal Kombat 1 combat in-between. In this table-top manner, players will navigate a series of challenges and can unlock skins, in-game currency, concept art, and other rewards.\r\nWhile the single player experience is far from being forgotten, I can't help but notice how the paid Easy Fatality feature is returning, which costs roughly $1 per 5 fatalities, which is an insane price for what could have been a free accessibility feature. It could have been like Street Fighter 6’s Dynamic Mode where complex moves are easier to perform, prioritizing fun over complexity.\r\nIn addition, another first time feature is a mechanic called Kameo Fighters, which are essential assist characters that are activated during combat, this is not similar to Tekken’s Tag mechanic, and only provides temporary assistance to the player without the ability to control them. These Kameo characters will be separate from the main roster, and chosen before each fight. While these mostly comprises classic looking characters like Sonya, there is a bit of overlap with Scorpion and Sub-Zero, which are also available in the main roster.\r\n## 📈Performance\r\n## 📈Performance\r\nThe performance is actually what hurt my experience the most, I consistently experienced occasional stutters, even with a decently specced system (i7-8700k, 32GB RAM, RTX 3080). Furthermore, the game only allows you to limit the frame rate up to 60FPS.\r\nThe transitions between cutscenes and combat are supposed to be seamless, but the induced stutters make it a very jarring experience that made it less impressive as it should have been.\r\nIn addition, in-game cutscenes, fatalities, and menus only run at  a measly 30FPS, which is a disappointing move considering the same thing happened on Mortal Kombat 11’s release as well and were patched to 60fps post-release anyway. The in-game sequences transitioning to FMV cutscenes are supposed to be seamless too, but I can’t help but notice the low quality compression used for the videos, which again made the experience jarring.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nMortal Kombat 1 proudly embraces the elements that make Mortal Kombat great while injecting fresh perspectives and narratives. The diverse roster, engaging gameplay, and entertaining story make it a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers. This game feels like the culmination of the developers' vision since the series' inception in the 90s, offering a visually stunning and highly entertaining experience. However, the unoptimized performance and some questionable monetization methods on top of an already expensive next-gen price of $70 leave much to be desired.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6286969) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Developed by Niantic, the same company behind the global AR hit Pokémon Go, this game allows players to use their smartphones to interact with a virtual overlay of the Monster Hunter world superimposed onto their real-world environment.\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\nIn Monster Hunter Now, players explore their surroundings to locate, track, and engage with various monsters and creatures from the Monster Hunter series. (13 monsters for now) The gameplay involves hunting monsters, gathering resources, and engaging in fast-paced sub-minute battles. How does it fare to mainline Monsters Hunter games, as well as its bigger AR brother, Pokemon Go?\r\n## 📖Story\r\n## 📖Story\r\nMonster Hunter Now actually introduces a unique narrative by coming up with an explanation as to how the Monster Hunter universe gets mixed with our actual world, paving the way for the crossover. Of course, it involves a lot of hand waving and “unexplained events” to pull off, but at least the acknowledgement is there. For what it’s worth, they actually made an effort in the narrative, even though it isn’t as deep as the mainline games.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nVisually, Monster Hunter Now impresses with detailed monster models and animations that are probably on par with console Monster Hunter games, and it also ran well on my Snapdragon 888 phone, with the option to enable 60fps mode during combat. The AR overlay seamlessly integrates the virtual Monster Hunter universe into real-world locations, creating an immersive experience, although some street view photos will blend better than others.\r\nThe Art Style retains the signature Monster Hunter aesthetic, making monsters instantly recognizable to fans of the franchise. Overall, the graphics and art style contribute significantly to the game's success in creating a believable and engaging Monster Hunter AR world.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nPlayable in predominantly portrait mode (landscape is available for combat only), the core gameplay of Monster Hunter Now revolves around exploration, hunting, and combat in an augmented reality setting. Players use a perimeter of their real-world location as a hunting ground for tracking monsters, gathering resources, and engaging in fast-paced battles. The battles are super quick — just around a minute, usually less — only just a fraction of what it would take to combat the same monsters in the mainline game, but it's that way for a reason, as Monster Hunter Now is designed to be a game that people will take on-the-go: On walks, jogs, commutes, car rides, etc.\r\nThe integration of real-world environments into the gameplay offers a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the game features a progression system with a small variety of weapons and armor to collect and upgrade, giving some sense of growth and achievement. Lighter weapons offer the advantage of swift and agile attacks, while heavier weapons demand precise timing and deliberate strikes to unleash potent and devastating blows.\r\nWhile the traditional gameplay may not replicate the full depth of traditional Monster Hunter titles, it excels in delivering an engaging AR adventure tailored for mobile devices. There are also other features tailored for the location-based gameplay, such as the paintball mechanic that allows players to mark rare monsters as they pass by your location, either actively or passively (even when you aren't using your phone), as well as the Wander items that essentially extend the range of your available hunting grounds.\r\n## 🕹Controls and Combat\r\n## 🕹Controls and Combat\r\nThe controls in Monster Hunter Now are user-friendly and accessible, making it easy for players to navigate the augmented world and engage in battles. It’s as basic as it can be, with simple taps and swipes for attacking and dodging that are reminiscent of popular mobile titles like Infinity Blade, providing an intuitive and mindless combat experience. The controls effectively cater to the mobile platform while maintaining a sense of interactivity and engagement during battles.\r\n## 📜Monetization\r\n## 📜Monetization\r\nMonster Hunter Now employs a freemium model, allowing players to make in-app purchases using premium currency (gems) for items and progression boosts. While there is some pressure to spend real money, especially since the game doesn't offer extensive content beyond the core gameplay loop, it's possible to enjoy the game without frequent purchases, especially for those who tend to move around a lot.\r\nHowever, for those who tend to stay in one spot to play, there is an added pressure to purchase the Wander Orb, which can increase the perimeter of your hunting area. Beyond that, it can get a bit boring if you don’t move a lot.\r\nPremium currency can be used to double resource rewards and expedite progress, but the game offers an auto-regeneration of HP and doesn't force players into constant purchases.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nMonster Hunter Now successfully combines the Monster Hunter universe with augmented reality gaming, creating an engaging and immersive experience for players that can cater both fans and newcomers. While it may not replicate the depth of traditional Monster Hunter titles, it excels in delivering a unique location-based adventure filled with iconic monsters. How much of that will translate into a worldwide success remains to be seen. You cannot deny that Monster Hunter is a popular brand, particularly as a portable game that started with the PSP and continued with the Switch. However, that’s still no guarantee because its overall popularity is still miniscule compared to the whole Pokemon Franchise.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6286000) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The gameplay involves hunting monsters, gathering resources, upgrading your gear, and engaging in fast-paced sub-minute battles. The battles are quick --- not as lengthy and epic as the mainline games --- but I find the bite-sized nature of it fun and just fits the AR-based nature of the game perfectly.\r\nOn the bright side, The art style retains the franchise's signature look as well as offering decent console-level graphics. The game offers both active and passive gameplay, allowing players to engage with the AR Monsters roaming with you even when the app is closed. The game also follows a free-to-play model, with in-app purchases to speed up progress.\r\nSince I was able to play during the soft launch, I was able to keep the progression that I made a month ago. So far my experience hasn't changed that much, which is mostly positive.  The game is still a good balance between location-based gaming and actual Monster Hunter formula, so don't expect much for any deep gameplay or combat mechanics like in a mainline Monster Hunter game. The actual combat is simplified for gesture based controls, and I'm sure anyone can learn how to play it in literal seconds.\r\nSo far, I will definitely recommend trying it especially if you love the concept of Pokemon Go and is also a fan of Monster Hunter. If you tend to move or travel a lot, you'll find a lot of enjoyment in this game. However if you tend to stay at one place at a time, the novelty can easily wear off.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6285862) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Assassin's Creed Mirage promises to be a refreshing return to the franchise's roots. Set against the historical backdrop of Baghdad, the game takes us back to the early years of the series, emphasizing parkour, stealth, and the art of assassination—a style reminiscent of the beloved Altair and Ezio eras. It's a deliberate shift away from the sprawling open-world RPGs and health sponges of enemies that have become the norm in recent Assassin's Creed titles.\r\nWell, the game is scheduled to release October 5 (a week earlier than originally announced) on modern game platforms: Xbox Series,  PlayStation 5, and PC, but in a surprising move, Ubisoft and Apple has announced that Assassin's Creed Mirage will also make its way to mobile gaming on the iPhone 15 Pro sometime in late 2023 or early 2024. That's right, Assassin's Creed Mirage, a modern AAA title, on the same timeframe as consoles, releasing on a mobile phone!\r\nAnd this is not a cloud version, nor a mobile port with toned-down graphics and missing features. This is a full native version running entirely on a mobile device, just like the Nintendo Switch or the Steam Deck. While there haven't been any details released regarding the actual performance, but knowing Apple, they are definitely not settling for a subpar performance in their AAA launch titles. This is different from the also upcoming Assassin's Creed game: Codename Jade, which is a full-pledged mobile game specifically designed for Android and iOS.\r\nThis is probably the biggest news for mobile gaming recently and what could be the much needed push to make many AAA games available on not just the iPhone 15 Pro, but to other phones as well such as the Android Platform, particularly gaming phones. Of course, this comes at a literal cost, instead adopting the usual free-to-play or freemium model, these games will most likely cost AAA prices too, at around $40 to $70 a piece.\r\nAre mobile gamers ready for triple A gaming this year and beyond? If there's one thing many mobile gamers are most requesting for, it's these kind of games. Can AAA gaming survive the harsh marketplace of zero dollar and in-app purchase dominated games? We'll find out soon enough in the coming months ahead.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6292706) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Assassin's Creed Mirage is generating a renewed interest in the series due to its promise of returning to the series' classic roots. Unlike recent entries that emphasized open-world exploration and RPG elements, Mirage aims to provide a more linear and story-driven experience. For fans who have longed for the days of parkour, stealth, and close-quarter combat, this return to basics is a welcome back change.\r\n## 🕌Setting\r\n## 🕌Setting\r\nThe game's primary setting is 9th-century Baghdad during a turbulent period. The chaotic yet vibrant streets of Baghdad will serve as the canvas for the game's narrative, as players navigate its alleys, rooftops, and bustling markets. Despite its striking resemblance and homage to the setting of the first game, it's important to note that this isn't a rehash of previous game settings, as the first game featured Israel, Palestine, and Syria instead.\r\n## 🗡️Character\r\n## 🗡️Character\r\nIt follows the journey of Basim Ibn Ishaq, a character very familiar to those who have played Assassin's Creed Valhalla. The game serves as Basim's “Origin Story” transforming from a street thief into a full-fledged member of the Assassin Brotherhood. This Brotherhood is dedicated to the pursuit of peace and liberty and stands in opposition to the Templar Order, whose vision of peace involves control and authority.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nMirage is designed to recapture the essence of earlier Assassin's Creed titles, focusing on core gameplay elements that have defined the series. Parkour, close-quarter combat, and stealth mechanics take center stage, offering players a more linear and story-focused experience compared to recent RPG-heavy entries.\r\nOne new showcased feature is the introduction of the \"Assassin Focus\" ability. This unique skill allows Basim to eliminate multiple enemies simultaneously through instantaneous stealth assassinations, provided he remains undetected. Time slows down after each assassination, allowing for precise targeting of the next enemy. This is similar to a Chain Assassination Skill first seen in Assassin's Creed: Origins and in some capacity in Assassin's Creed: Liberation. Personally, I have some minor gripes about how this isn’t exactly going back to the roots, but I think this is a fun feature nonetheless that will make the game more accessible to players.\r\nThere are refinements in movement and running animations that ensure a fluid and dynamic parkour experience, though it's hard to ignore that it feels somewhat barebones, and I can't help but think that Assassin's Creed: Unity still did it better. Currently, it represents a great 'back to basics' approach, with a parkour system reminiscent of the first few Assassin’s Creed games, but I hope to see more dynamic parkour animations in future iterations. The combat on the other hand seems like a mix of RPG style AC and old school AC, but we’ll have to play it ourselves to really see what it’s like.\r\n## 📱Release (PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Mobile)\r\n## 📱Release (PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Mobile)\r\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is slated for release on October 5 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and the iPhone 15 Pro, making it one of the most eagerly awaited releases of the year.\r\nIn a surprising move, Assassin's Creed Mirage will be making its way to the iPhone 15 Pro, marking a remarkable step forward for mobile gaming.  The success of AAA gaming on mobile could potentially change player expectations. Gamers may become more willing to pay for high-quality experiences, leading to a shift in the mobile gaming landscape.\r\nAssassin's Creed Mirage and other upcoming AAA mobile titles will serve as important test cases. The success or failure of these games in terms of sales and player reception will provide valuable insights into the viability of AAA gaming on mobile.\r\n## ⚔️Codename Jade\r\n## ⚔️Codename Jade\r\nif you're confused, Assassin's Creed Mirage is different from the also upcoming Assassin's Creed game: Codename Jade, which is a full-pledged mobile game specifically designed for Android and iOS.\r\nMirage's availability on Consoles, PC, and the iPhone 15 Pro positions it as a premium gaming experience, with the potential to redefine the standards for AAA gaming on mobile. In contrast, Codename Jade is set to be a full-fledged mobile game accessible to a wider range of mobile phones, aiming to provide an authentic Assassin's Creed experience optimized for touch controls.\r\nBoth titles offer exciting prospects for fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise, catering to different preferences and platforms. As we eagerly anticipate their respective releases, it's an exciting time for both traditional and mobile gaming enthusiasts, promising a diverse array of adventures in the Assassin's Creed universe.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6292943) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Lies of P\r\nEver since Dark Souls' success in 2011, there has been no shortage of these so-called Souls-like games. And now, we have another game with Lies of P, and it's one of the most promising entries yet in the Souls-like genre.\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\n## 📖Story\r\n## 📖Story\r\nLies of P offers a fresh twist on the classic story of Pinocchio, set against the backdrop of the enchanting 19th century Belle Époque era.  The game plunges players into the city of Krat, a place powered by the mysterious mineral Ergo but now plagued by a frenzy that has turned its puppet inhabitants against humanity. The game weaves a dark and compelling tale of a city torn apart by greed and the lust for power. As the silent Pinocchio, the player is tasked with navigating this perilous world while concealing and “lying” his true identity as a puppet.\r\nLies of P introduces a unique “Lying” dialogue mechanic where player decisions during specific moments in the game impact the storyline, as well as Pinocchio's character development. These choices can lead to different outcomes and shape the reactions of characters and the world itself. The concept of lying versus telling the truth is central to this system and adds flavor to the gameplay experience.\r\nThe game's narrative, while based on the classic tale of Pinocchio, takes unexpected twists and turns that keep players engaged. The storytelling is one of its strongest assets, and the ability to influence the course of events through choices adds a layer of freedom. It’s approach is similar to other Soulslike games with its environmental storytelling and its silent protagonist against a non-linear backdrop narrative.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art style\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art style\r\nLies of P draws players into a bewitching, dark, and atmospheric world that evokes strong similarities to the acclaimed PlayStation game Bloodborne. The game's graphics and aesthetics are strikingly reminiscent of Bloodborne, with intricate and gothic-inspired architecture that exudes a sense of foreboding. Just as Bloodborne is known for its nightmarish creatures, Lies of P instead substitutes them with puppet robots that are equally eerie and menacing, adding a unique twist to the familiar Soulslike formula. In many respects, Lies of P feels like a legitimate spiritual successor to Bloodborne, capturing the essence of its dark and macabre world while introducing its own evolved captivating narrative.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nAs a Souls-like game, Lies of P lives up to its genre's reputation for challenging gameplay. Combat is at the forefront, requiring precision, timing, and a keen understanding of enemy patterns. If you're familiar with the Souls-like games, you'll find yourself in familiar territory, with death lurking around every corner.\r\nThe game offers three character classes, known as \"Paths,\" each with its own unique strengths, weaknesses, and playstyles. The Path of the Cricket is balanced between strength and dexterity, suitable for versatile \"quality builds.\" Starts with the \"Puppet's Blade\" weapon. The Path of the Bastard focuses on dexterity-based combat, excelling in speed and agility. High stamina allows for a flurry of attacks. Starts with the \"Wintry Rapier\" weapon. Lastly, Path of the Sweeper is a strength-based combat style with high Vitality and powerful attacks. Starts with the \"Greatsword of Fate\" weapon but lacks stamina for sustained attacks. Furthermore, Lies of P features a wide range of weapons, including swords, axes, and unique mechanical arm gadgets. Each weapon type offers a distinct set of moves and abilities, allowing for varied and rich combat strategies.\r\nIn terms of weapons and customization, Lies of P offers a rich array of options. Alongside traditional Soulslike weaponry like swords and axes, Pinocchio's mechanical arm can be equipped with various gadgets, from grappling hooks to flamethrowers. The game boasts an impressive 30 different weapon types with 100 possible combinations, giving players plenty of room to experiment.\r\nHowever, there's a catch. Once players discover a weapon or gadget combination that suits their playstyle, there's a temptation to stick with it and “not fix what ain’t broken”. While experimentation is encouraged, the game's design may inadvertently discourage players from diversifying their approach to combat.\r\n## ⬆️Progression\r\n## ⬆️Progression\r\nLies of P features a leveling system centered around the game's currency known as Ergo. This currency is earned by defeating enemies, particularly puppets and bosses, as well as through item sales. Ergo serves as the means for character progression, allowing players to invest in various attributes and skills to customize their character's abilities. This mirrors the character development found in traditional Soulslike games, where players make strategic decisions about how to improve their character. The use of Ergo aligns seamlessly with the Soulslike format, providing a familiar yet engaging pathway for character growth.\r\nAdditionally, Lies of P incorporates Stargazers as a checkpoint and progression system, which is another straightforward adaptation of the Soulslike format. These Stargazers, basically Bonfires from the Dark Souls series, serve as essential save points and respawn locations. They not only offer a means to preserve progress but also grant various effects and customization options, adding depth to the gameplay experience. Stargazers encourage exploration by revealing lore and hidden elements in the game world, reinforcing the immersive storytelling aspects often seen in Soulslike games. Overall, Lies of P effectively integrates these systems into its gameplay, providing a satisfying adaptation of the Soulslike format, complete with challenging combat, character progression, and atmospheric exploration.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nWhile the game successfully captures the essence and challenging difficulty of Souls-like combat, it does come with its set of challenges. Combat can feel clunky and unresponsive at times, leading to moments of frustration. There is an over reliance on the parry mechanic, which can leave the dodge mechanic pretty useless. Dodge in particular, has a noticeable delay between initiating the dodge and actually executing it, which can be problematic when facing powerful foes. This can leave players feeling somewhat at the mercy of the game's blocking and parrying mechanics.\r\nThe absence of animation canceling exacerbates these issues. The inability to interrupt certain actions with others can make combat feel less fluid than desired. However, it's worth noting that the combat system, despite its quirks, has an oddly addictive quality. Achieving a perfectly timed parry or landing a series of attacks feels immensely satisfying, creating a love-hate relationship with the mechanics.\r\n## 📉Performance\r\n## 📉Performance\r\nWhat sets Lies of P apart from some recent releases is its exceptional optimization. Unlike many contemporary games that suffer from poorly optimized states, Lies of P runs beautifully on my PC, delivering an almost locked 144 FPS experience on my high-end system featuring an i7-8700k and an RTX 3080. Remarkably, Even with the last-minute addition of Denuvo, Lies of P’s performance comes without any noticeable stutters or frame drops, resulting in a truly buttery-smooth gameplay experience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nLies of P is a game that deserves recognition for its unique narrative mechanics and storytelling. While its combat may feel clunky at times and animation mechanics  could be smoother, these issues don't overshadow the overall experience. The character progression system and customization options add depth, and the game's narrative is an evolved version of the souls-like style of narrative storytelling. In many respects, Lies of P feels like a legitimate spiritual successor to Bloodborne, and it’s also on PC.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6293349) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It ran buttery smooth at almost locked 144FPS framerate, it's almost unbelievable that I am getting these performances after such negative experiences in recent games, even in recent hits like Starfield and Baldur's Gate 3. So far, this game has been a frustratingly good experience, just like a true Souls-like game would be. If you like Souls-like game and are wanting for more, this game should be right up your alley.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6293350) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Read the Review here https://www.taptap.io/post/6310730 and you’ll find the codes hidden somewhere.\r\nThe gameplay mechanics in Blood Strike closely resemble the conventional battle royale format, pitting up to 100 players against each other in an expansive map featuring diverse biomes. Players are tasked with scavenging for cash, weapons, armor, and supplies. The current map design offers ample space for exploration, vehicular use, and intense player encounters. Presently, the game allows solo play or teaming up in squads of four.\r\nAs for accessibility and the streamlining of gameplay experience, it offers one of the best systems that I’ve seen in mobile battle royale games. For starters, the aim assist is very strong in this one. Almost console-like in terms of snapping into enemies even far away, simplifying aiming and eliminating adversaries. This dynamic not only enhances action-packed gameplay but also places a strong emphasis on reflexes and tactical positioning. To further accommodate the game's fast-paced nature, Blood Strike introduces a lenient respawn system. Players have the opportunity to re-enter the game even after elimination, granted that their teammate remains alive once the respawn timer concludes.\r\nSo far, this game seems to be a good blend of Call of Duty: Warzone and Apex Legends, which somewhat fills a gap in the otherwise saturated mobile battle royale market, as Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile is still unreleased as of this point, and Apex Legends Mobile had just discontinued its services last May.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6310729) Originally posted on TapTap.",

(First come, first served only)\r\n## 📺Graphics and Performance\r\n## 📺Graphics and Performance\r\nThe graphics of Blood Strike is a bit of a mixed bag. While specific elements, such as character models and textures, are detailed and good looking enough, the overall visual fidelity leans toward simplicity. This choice isn’t surprising though, it's probably to accommodate a wide range of devices. However, the performance and general polish still requires further optimization and has plenty of room for improvement. While it offers support for high frame rates, I found that it didn't run as smoothly as some of the visually superior battle royale games on my Snapdragon 888 device.\r\nOne gripe though, the game is aggressively asking for your storage permissions for screenshot purposes,. You can decline it, but there is no way to disable these prompts that will appear every few seconds until you finally agree to it. So beware.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay and Progression\r\n## 🎮Gameplay and Progression\r\nThe gameplay mechanics in Blood Strike closely resemble the conventional battle royale format, pitting up to 100 players against each other in an expansive map featuring diverse biomes. Players are tasked with scavenging for in-match cash, weapons, armor, and supplies. The current map design offers ample space for exploration, vehicular use, and intense player encounters. Presently, the game allows solo play or teaming up in squads of four.\r\nAn intriguing feature of Blood Strike is its cash system, which allows players to request loadout drops after completing specific tasks. These drops provide access to rare weapons and equipment, enhancing a player's competitive advantage.\r\nAs for accessibility and the streamlining of gameplay experience, it offers one of the best systems that I’ve seen in mobile battle royale games. For starters, the aim assist is very strong in this one. Almost console-like in terms of snapping into enemies even far away, simplifying aiming and eliminating adversaries. Not everyone may appreciate this kind of aim-assist feature, but this dynamic not only enhances action-packed gameplay but also places a strong emphasis on reflexes and tactical positioning. To further accommodate the game's fast-paced nature, Blood Strike introduces a lenient respawn system. Players have the opportunity to re-enter the game even after elimination, granted that their teammate remains alive once the respawn timer concludes.\r\nBlood Strike introduces a roster of nine characters called Strikers, with five initially unlocked. Each Striker possesses unique active and passive abilities, contributing to diverse gameplay experiences. For example, Kraken is focused on utility and combat, E.M.T is focused on healing teammates, Val focuses on Reconnaissance, while Jet focuses on high damage output via grenades and artillery.\r\nProgression relies on a Merit-based system, allowing players to unlock weapon attachments and cosmetics by consistently using these specific weapons. Additionally, players can customize their initial loadout, reducing dependence on RNG and looting. The in-game currency system allows for the purchase of items from vending machines around the map, further enhancing player customization.\r\nFormerly known as Project: BloodStrike\r\nFormerly known as Project: BloodStrike\r\nI personally have not played any of the earlier test iterations of this game. However, reports suggest that there have been significant changes compared to previous test versions. It appears that the game has undergone substantial evolution throughout its ongoing development. Many features and aspects of the game were entirely reworked, bearing little resemblance to their original gameplay style. However, as we near its official launch, it seems that this current version of the game represents its final form, as even progression during this soft launch will carry over to the official release.\r\n## 📜Free-to-Play\r\n## 📜Free-to-Play\r\nBlood Strike is set to use a free-to-play model, including the introduction of premium currency and gacha mechanics. These elements enable players to obtain cosmetic items, weapons, and unlock the rest of the Strikers. There are no stamina system in place, so players can play to their heart's content. There is a bit of a pay-to-win element because you can acquire new weapons using real money or in-game currency, but ultimately, it all boils down to player skill in combat situations.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nBlood Strike presents itself as a compelling addition to the battle royale genre, borrowing elements from established titles while prioritizing accessibility for a wider range of devices. The graphics, while not groundbreaking, serve their intended purpose. The game's strong aim-assist insures a fast-paced gameplay easily accessible to many players. This game is probably the perfect alternative to the still unreleased Call of Duty: Warzone and can also fill the void left by the surprising shutdown of Apex Legends Mobile last May.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6310730) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Infinite BordersGlobal\r\nlyndonguitar\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nInfinite Borders puts players in the ever captivating Three Kingdoms period of Ancient China, and offers a blend of strategy, RPG city-building, and gacha mechanics. Having spent considerable time in both its native East Asian markets —previously known as Reign of Warlords or ROW: Tam Quốc. — It is now entering a global release during its Closed Beta Test phase. However, the English localization is still a bit spotty.\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style:\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style:\r\nThe visual aspect of any game plays a pivotal role in capturing the player's imagination and enhancing the overall gaming experience. Infinite Borders somewhat excels in this department, offering impressive 3D graphics that transport players to the ancient Eastern world of the Three Kingdoms while still being faithful to the era’s artworks by infusion of Chinese-style art that adds an authentic touch to the game, particularly to the character and unit design, including some of the iconic Three Kingdoms heroes such as Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Lu Bu.\r\nThere are also real-time weather changes for additional flavor, which add a layer of dynamism to the game's world.  Additionally, Infinite Borders offers an alternative \"2D mode\" for players who prefer smoother performance or those playing on low-end phones, while maintaining the same aesthetic and still looking somewhat 3D.\r\nOne area where it falls short is its sound design. It lacks any sort of voice-overs, leaving character interactions devoid of spoken dialogues; even the video cutscenes only have captions. It feels like I'm watching a muted video with subtitles. Its combat sound effects also fall short of delivering the expected intensity in battles. However, the game manages to redeem itself through a well-composed and fitting soundtrack.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe heart of any game lies in its gameplay, and Infinite Borders combines several popular elements to create a multifaceted experience. The mechanics can be a bit confusing, but it gets better in time as you play, especially if you have prior experience with RPG city builders. New genre players may find themselves grappling with the complexity of the game early on.\r\nAt its core, the game is a kingdom builder set in ancient China during the Three Kingdoms period. Players are tasked with constructing and upgrading various buildings within their city to gather essential resources like wood, iron, and stone.\r\nUnlike other city-builders where you can place individual buildings alongside the main Town Hall, Infinite Borders castles are a monolithic, one-big structure, and the upgrades are accomplished through a research or skill-tree-like system instead.\r\nThe city-building aspect of the game can be highly addictive, as the desire to expand your city and conquer neighboring territories drives you forward. Armies form the backbone of doing any action in the game’s world, and you can recruit armies, assign heroes to lead them, and to be able to expand your city and territory, one tile at a time. I can definitely see the resemblance to the iconic game series “Romance of the Three Kingdoms”, just mobile-ized in terms of mechanics and monetization techniques.\r\nCombat in Infinite Borders is resolved automatically between armies, determined by your armies power level, this results in players forming unique teams of heroes, each with their own skills and abilities. The gacha mechanics come into play here, as recruiting heroes becomes a vital part of your strategy, aside from army strength and your “strategem” used. Players can either spend real money or grind in-game currency in order to partake in gacha pulls.\r\nOne of the game's strengths is the freedom it provides in terms of playstyle. Whether you want to be a relentless warlord, a passive city builder focused on resource management and defense, or a diplomatic lord forging alliances, the choice is yours. This flexibility allows players to tailor their experience to their preferred style of play. You can play the game without interacting with other kingdoms and just turtle play on your own.\r\nWhile the game offers a compelling mix of strategy and city-building, it's worth noting that Infinite Borders requires patience due to its troop stamina system, limited builders, and real-world waiting periods for actions such as construction, research, raiding, or troop travel time. It takes too long to do anything worthwhile in quick sessions, this game is best played over a span of days, weeks, or months. Just occasionally checking in on a day to day basis, unless you are willing to spend loads of money.\r\n## ⬆️Progression\r\n## ⬆️Progression\r\nThe addictive nature of upgrading buildings, conquering new lands, and expanding your territory is one of the game's major strengths. This constant sense of growth and improvement keeps players engaged and invested in their cities' development, until they hit that brick wall which requires waiting in real time or the lack of resources, which can pressure players into spending more money. The hero collection aspect also contributes to the progression system. The game features In-app purchases that allow players to acquire premium currency, which can be used for various purposes, including speeding up construction, acquiring heroes, or obtaining other in-game advantages.\r\nWith over 300 heroes to recruit, players can constantly work towards enhancing their teams and unlocking new strategic possibilities. The diversity of heroes and their unique abilities provide depth to the gameplay and keep it from feeling stale.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nInfinite Borders is an interesting strategy and city-building game, particularly for players who have a fondness for ancient Chinese history and the Three Kingdoms period. It’s basically another take on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms game formula, but made with mobile gaming in mind. While it's not without its flaws, including localization issues and a slow progression pace designed to pressure you into spending money, beyond that, it’s a quite decent game nonetheless.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6312605) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Infinite Borders is an engaging strategy game that transports players to the heart of the Three Kingdoms period. You'll have the chance to align yourself with legendary heroes, conquer new lands, and wage epic battles against formidable foes.\r\nThe Closed Beta Test for Infinite Borders runs from September 15th to September 30th and covers three major regions: Asia, North America, and Europe. While the game has been available in East Asia regions like China, Thailand, and Vietnam under the title \"Reign of Warlords\" or \"ROW: Tam Quốc\" for a few years now, it's now making its mark on a global scale.\r\nInfinite Borders combines the romanticized events of The Three Kingdoms era with RPG city-building mechanics and gacha elements. As a player, you'll construct and upgrade buildings within your city, managing resources like wood, iron, and stone. The game offers over 300 heroes with diverse skills, and caters to many playstyles; either you just want to build your city, or maybe conquer neighboring territories, or perhaps ally with other kingdoms. It's all possible in this game.\r\nWhile some rough edges and English localization issues may exist for now, they don't overshadow the game's potential for enjoyment - because it IS quite addicting. Of course, this comes at the cost of colossal real-life wait times for things such as building construction, castle upgrades, army training, and troop marching, unless you spend money to speed up the progression.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6312501) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "PAYDAY 3\r\nPAYDAY 3 is an upcoming first-person shooter game developed by Starbreeze Studios and published by Deep Silver. It is the third installment in the popular coop game series PAYDAY. The game is set to be released on September 21, 2023, with a 3-day Early Access period for those who purchase the Silver and Gold editions. I had the opportunity to try out the game three days early and see how it holds up.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Performance\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Performance\r\nGraphically, it’s not hard to see that PAYDAY 3 looks like a straightforward Unreal Engine FPS game, tweaked to resemble the aesthetics of both PAYDAY 1 and 2. Nothing groundbreaking, nonetheless the graphics themselves are impressive on a technical level, particularly with lighting and explosions.\r\nAs for the performance, there was noticeable stuttering during the initial startup, which is likely due to the shader cache building up, but it resolved itself after some time. What truly shines here is the stability during heists and actual gameplay. I experienced next to no bugs in this department.\r\n## 📖Story\r\n## 📖Story\r\nPAYDAY 3 takes you back into the shoes of the notorious PAYDAY Gang. After several years of silence following their reign of terror over Washington D.C., they are forced out of retirement to face a new threat. PAYDAY has never been primarily known for its story-driven narrative, so it's a nice added touch to still include some story elements. Ultimately, the story is the least of our concerns in this co-op PvP shooter, and it's one that many players choose to ignore anyway, as PAYDAY has always been about its adrenaline-pumping heists and intense gunfights.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nSpeaking of heists and gunfights. The core gameplay of PAYDAY 3 remains faithful to the series formula that fans know and love. You choose a level, plan your heist, and execute it with your crew, all while dealing with waves of law enforcement and security forces. It's the kind of cooperative experience that can lead to intense moments of strategy and action, and PAYDAY 3 is nothing short of that experience.\r\nMy experience during the early access phase had one temporary drawback. Finding other players to team up with proved to be a bit challenging. There is no lobby browser to manually find games, and I am left at the mercy of the queuing system. As a result, I ended up mostly playing solo with AI companions. Surprisingly, this turned out better than expected, despite a few noticeable quirks typically associated with AI companions, especially when it came to more complex tasks like carrying equipment or money bags. I had to go back and forth solo painstakingly just to complete the objectives on my own. However, they are more than competent when it comes to handling enemies, which is a positive aspect.\r\n## 🔫Gunplay\r\n## 🔫Gunplay\r\nShooting has always been a huge aspect of PAYDAY, and in PAYDAY 3, it's better than ever. The controls feel responsive, and the weapons pack a satisfying punch. The feeling feels close to how Call of Duty’s gunplay feels.\r\n## 💵 Heists\r\n## 💵 Heists\r\nThe heart and soul of Payday have always been the heists, and PAYDAY 3 doesn't disappoint in its roster of 8 Heists at launch, with most heists as potentially being some of the best in the series. The level design is top-notch, offering both strategic options and a sense of freedom in how you approach your objectives. This level of creativity in mission design keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting.\r\n## 🥷Stealth\r\n## 🥷Stealth\r\nThere is more emphasis on stealth pathways. The stealth mechanics bear a striking resemblance to Hitman's approach. Players navigate through different zones, including public, private, and secure areas. Entering private zones alerts guards who attempt to escort you back to public areas rather than immediately triggering alarms. While this might seem like a refreshing change, it's worth noting that stealth can still feel somewhat pointless. The gap in difficulty between going loud and going stealth is huge, making it more efficient to just play on by going loud. This decision might deter players from embracing the stealth approach, as it doesn't offer significant advantages in terms of rewards.\r\n## ⬆️Progression\r\n## ⬆️Progression\r\nThe progression system in Payday 3 is a bit peculiar. Everything, from weapons to equipment, is locked behind levels, meaning that even if you get rich already via Heists, you can't purchase anything anyway until you've reached the required level for that item. This might come across as frustrating for most players, who’d want to experiment with different loadouts or weapons as early as finishing the first Heist. There’s literally nothing to unlock or progress with unless you grind Heists. The game experience is artificially prolonged as a result, and earning cash becomes less rewarding.\r\nCharacter progression wise, PAYDAY 3 introduces a notable shift in the skill system compared to its predecessor. Instead of the Skill Tree, the game adopts “Skill Lines”. This streamlined approach simplifies skill progression, featuring a base node, upgrade nodes, and a Mastery Node. Players can unlock the base skill and choose their desired upgrades without a predetermined linear path.\r\nAdditionally, the game introduces Crime Net Stacks or C-Stacks as a secondary currency, which is probably based on Cryptocurrency. While players still use cash for standard purchases, converting it to C-Stacks enables the acquisition of special weapons, cosmetics, and high-end equipment. It's important to note that the more cash is traded for C-Stacks, the more expensive the process becomes. Fortunately, this cost resets on a weekly basis. Note that C-Stacks can only be earned by actively playing the game and is not a premium currency. This system appears designed to encourage regular gameplay and maintain an active player base post-launch, but again may artificially prolong the gameplay experience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nJust like those that came before it, PAYDAY 3 delivers on its promise of providing a fun and exciting co-op shooter, allowing players to immerse themselves in high-stakes heists cooperatively. The core gameplay, heist design, and gunplay are undeniably enjoyable. However, it's impossible to ignore the missed opportunities and peculiar progression elements that holds PAYDAY 3 from revolutionizing the genre and becoming a true evolution of the series.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6316757) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "lyndonguitar\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\n## ✨Overview\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\n## 📌Pros and Cons\r\n## 📖Story\r\n## 📖Story\r\nAt its core is the story of the Child of Chaos, a being who dared to challenge the Dragon God's reign over the Chaos Universum but ultimately failed. The Dragon Queen, Tiamat, personally exiled this rebellious entity, and for centuries, it remained imprisoned. Yet, ominous forces are at play, and a thousand sacrifices threaten to set the Child of Chaos free.\r\nOur hero — who happens to be the thousandth sacrifice, is intertwined with these very events. Over the course of the story, our hero meets Noteera and Heksandra, along with many more companions to aid them in their adventure. However, there seems to be more to the story than meets the eye, and the plot thickens as we delve deeper into the narrative.\r\nThe plot unfolds in a manner reminiscent of a finely crafted fantasy novel or Dungeons and Dragons campaign, with layers of complexity and revelations that keep you guessing. With its ability to surprise and subvert expectations, creating an engrossing narrative that continually evolves. It's a story that grows in depth and complexity as you progress, with twists and turns that will leave you pondering the true nature of chaos and destiny.\r\nMost of the story is decently voice acted, and it even comes with a proper narrator that helps set the mood for the storytelling. The only minor caveat in the story department is that, at times, the abundance of characters, subplots, and dialogue can feel overwhelming. To the point that you just want to play. However, this complexity contributes to the game's rich lore for those invested in it, and players who appreciate intricate narratives will find it rewarding.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe graphics of the game are just simply amazing with console-like fidelity in the character models and the world around. The general art style is deeply rooted in the gothic and dark fantasy genres. The game world is characterized by grim, eerie, and foreboding settings. It often features dilapidated architecture, macabre landscapes, and a general sense of decay and despair.\r\n## 🕹Performance and Controls\r\n## 🕹Performance and Controls\r\nPlaying both the PC and Mobile version, there is literally no difference in how it looks, as long as you select the same graphical settings. Both are equally as beautiful, although of course, playing the mobile version was a little bit more impressive because of the pocket-sized nature. I was able to play at High on my Snapdragon 888 phone and very high on my i7-8700k RTX 3080 PC without any issues, although you may encounter some occasional lagging especially in the first few minutes of opening the game.(e.g. opening menus or entering combat).\r\nThere is also occasional absence of audio (music, sound effects, or dialogue) during certain sequences, resulting in a dead silent experience for the players that at times I thought the game lost its audio or I accidentally muted it. While the game excels in its voice acting and orchestral high-fantasy soundtrack, it falls short in delivering a consistent audio experience.\r\nAs for the controls, It supports both touch and keyboard/mouse controls for their respective platforms, in which I have no gripes with. Unfortunately, there is no support for physical gamepads.\r\n## 🎮Core Gameplay\r\n## 🎮Core Gameplay\r\nThe story adapts to your choices and actions, ensuring that both the narrative and gameplay experience feels empowering and cinematic, although not to the extent that the game feels like an open-ended dynamic sandbox — as everyone is still bound to the same narrative structure as everyone else. Whether your goal is to destroy your enemies, save the world, or just simply explore it, Dragonheir: Silent Gods suits various playstyles very well.\r\nThe game introduces over 200 different heroes, representing various races and classes, including Iskallan Dwarves, Death Knights, Orcs, Humans, Dark Elves, Sorcerers, Knights, and Undead, among others. This diversity offers players a wide range of options for assembling their dream team of heroes. By the first few hours I had already recruited lots of heroes to use for my adventure. Each hero can be customized with equipment, runes, and further upgraded using ascension materials obtained from grinding the game.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe entire combat is automated and can be fast forwarded, but you can still heavily influence it through the initial placement of units and by strategically using hero skills. Hero skills range from high-DPS single targets to massive AOE attacks like fireballs. Up to five heroes from your lineup can be selected and freely maneuver in a grid-like battlefield while in combat, engaging enemies with their AI. Fortunately, there is no friendly fire for AOE attacks, allowing players to unleash their AOE skills and abilities without worry. The animations are not only visually appealing but also entertaining for the most part. Of course at the end of the day, the heroes’ power level and rarity matters the most.\r\nFurthermore, the game offers slight variations to the combat system. In addition to the traditional versus combat, the layout of the grids also vary. There's also the dungeon crawling variation where you progress through the dungeon, facing one wave of enemies at a time. During some defensive-oriented segments, the system transforms into a tower defense setup, requiring you to strategically place units and prevent enemies from escaping along the designated path.  I like the variety, it avoids the game pit falling into a repetitive single combat style while still introducing not too many variations that it becomes hard to master.\r\n## 🗺 The World\r\n## 🗺 The World\r\nThe game features an overworld 'adventure' mode that resembles a tabletop setup. In this mode, you can freely explore and interact with the world, encountering enemies, collecting resources, taking on dungeons, challenges, and visiting various locations, including cities and taverns. The aesthetics of the overworld map are equally visually appealing as the overall graphics of the game, enhancing the game's immersive atmosphere.\r\nNotably, there is no change in art style or a sudden shift to a Chibi art style, as seen in other RPG games. Players will find themselves in numerous situations where they must make choices, roll dice for skill checks, and experience the corresponding outcomes. These elements add an extra layer of role-playing akin to classic DND tabletop games, where decisions carry both risks and rewards that shape the overall gameplay experience.\r\nAfter the introduction part of the game, I was free to practically go anywhere I want in this big map of the material plane, and do things my way. Teleportation is common; the player isn’t deprived of fast traveling even to unexplored locations even from the start.\r\nThe world is expansive, and features many game modes that contribute to a great role-playing experience. Such as setting up camp anywhere, anytime during adventure mode to craft meals, equipment, train, and improve your characters. As well as the option to join alliances and take on dungeon challenges with friends, or against them in asynchronous arena style PVP matches.\r\nPersonally, fresh off coming from playing Baldur's Gate 3 and Diablo IV? Dragonheir: Silent Gods definitely passed the vibe check for me, and feels somewhat similar to either of those games in its artistic tones and gameplay mechanics. The use of the 20 sided dice alone is a nice nod to Dungeons and Dragons’s style of play.\r\n## 💵 Free-to-play with In-app purchases\r\n## 💵 Free-to-play with In-app purchases\r\nAs a live-service free-to-play game, it features expected features like login bonuses, weekly events, premium currency, a stamina system to limit playtime, and even gacha methods to obtain new heroes. Remarkably, the game strikes a decent balance, at least in my free-to-play experience in my first few hours, I found the game highly enjoyable and I never felt pressured to spend money. I found the gacha rates are kind of generous, as I was already able to get five legendary units in my first few hours of play, and I was overflowing with stamina. Moreover, there are combat-oriented game modes designed to facilitate material farming for character progression.\r\nSince previous test leading up to the September 19 release of Dragonheir: Silent Gods, the game also has undergone some changes and additions that may be noteworthy for previous testers:\r\n60 New Heroes are added, new season dungeon and mid-season events, the addition of a new playable race called Lizardfolk, and a shifting rotation for elemental affinity and rules each season. For Season 1, new pairings include Fire & Poison, Radiance & Lightning, and Necrosis & Ice.\r\n60 New Heroes are added, new season dungeon and mid-season events, the addition of a new playable race called Lizardfolk, and a shifting rotation for elemental affinity and rules each season.

In total, there were nine distinct endings to discover, each offering a different conclusion to Pieberry's journey.\r\nWitchSpring R appears to be an intriguing remake of the original WitchSpring 1, offering a blend of storytelling, character development, and gameplay elements.

With its ability to surprise and subvert expectations, creating an engrossing narrative that continually evolves. It's a story that grows in depth and complexity as you progress, with twists and turns that will leave you pondering the true nature of chaos and destiny.\r\nAfter the introduction part of the game, I was free to practically go anywhere I want in this big map of the material plane, and do things my way. Teleportation is common; the player isn’t deprived of fast traveling even to unexplored locations even from the start.\r\nPersonally, fresh off coming from playing Baldur's Gate 3 and Diablo IV? Dragonheir: Silent Gods definitely passed the vibe check for me, and feels somewhat similar to either of those games in its artistic tones and gameplay mechanics. The use of the 20 sided dice alone is a nice nod to Dungeons and Dragons’ style of play.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6315613) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "unVEIL the world is a tactical hero summoning RPG that immerses players in an epic narrative centered around a massive tower. Within this colossal tower is where the characters take on formidable challenges. As players venture deeper, they unravel the mysteries of a world only accessible to those who dare to enter.\r\nThe renowned manga artist and illustrator Posuka Demizu, known for \"The Promised Neverland,\" has lent her artistic talents to the game's character designs, adding a unique and visually captivating element. The protagonist, Yuta Lassica, takes center stage in this intriguing premise.\r\nThe graphics, faithful to Demizu's signature style, blend the charm of HD-2D inspired visuals with high quality cel-shaded 3D graphics, promising a refreshing and visually stunning gaming experience. Of course, the collaboration with Posuka Demizu ensures that the characters are visually captivating, and the use of cel-shaded 3D graphics adds a refreshing twist to traditional art style or HD-2D visuals.\r\nDeveloped jointly by NetEase Games and Shueisha Games, unVEIL the world was first announced at TGS 2022. Not much is known about the game since that initial announcement, until today’s Tokyo Game Show 2023 trailer which added a small drop of new information.\r\nLooking at the trailer, which mostly showcased beautiful presentation with music and visuals, actually showed blink-and-you'll-miss-it footage of the tactical RPG gameplay. It seems that the game will be played vertically or in portrait mode, with cards of heroes at the bottom and the gameplay action front and center. We are probably looking at a turn-based or semi-turn-based combat system here, judging by how the units are positioned. Before that part in the trailer though, we probably lowkey already saw the actual battle animations for the main characters that are going to be used in combat. Once again, still not much is known, and we are left with a crumb of game details to talk about.\r\nHowever, as with other similar games in the market bearing the category of tactical hero summoning RPG game, it’s safe to expect that we’ll be seeing a free-to-play game with gacha mechanics. Tactical hero summoning RPG mobile games usually combine strategic team-building with turn-based combat, hero collection mechanics, and a variety of modes and challenges to create an engaging and often long-lasting live-service game experience.\r\nAs with these games, players will build a team from their hero roster, which are collected by summoning using in-game currency or special summoning items. These heroes come with various rarities and abilities, and collecting a diverse roster is a key aspect of the game. These games often have a story or campaign mode where players progress through a series of levels, battles, and missions, interconnected with a narrative that unfolds as players advance. The huge tower shown in the promotional videos will surely play a central role in the story mode and its missions.\r\nVisit here for more information about TapTap's Picks from Tokyo Game Show 2023\r\nTokyo Game Show with TapTap Exclusive Deep Dive\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6326113) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Dark and Light MobileGlobal 6.5 Adventure Action Download",

    "body": "Dark and Light MobileGlobal\r\n6.5\r\nAdventure\r\nAction\r\nDownload\r\nDark and Light Mobile is an open-world survival RPG sandbox game designed for mobile devices. Set in a fantasy world filled with diverse landscapes and magical creatures, players can explore this expansive world, tame magical creatures like Wyverns, Griffins, and Unicorns, and build their own structures and homes. The game also features an RPG crafting system where players can create weapons and armor using resources gathered around the world and by using magic.\r\nDark and Light Mobile has been adapted from the original PC version and provides basically the same experience but to mobile devices, although with some adjustments to graphics and controls to suit the platform. I first saw this interesting early access game years ago on Steam but never really got around to it. I didn’t have the chance to play it before. Surprisingly, it has also been ported to mobile devices just recently, and I finally had the opportunity to try the game during its ongoing Beta Test, which will last until October 31, 2023.\r\n## 📺Visuals and Performance\r\nThe visuals have been toned down in the transition from PC to mobile version, but it still looks good for a mobile game. I’ve experienced laggy performance for the most part and some crashes — even with my Snapdragon 888 device, but it remains playable and impressive nonetheless. This is especially notable considering that they managed to port the entire PC experience into a mobile package without any big sacrifices in gameplay. The game has been fully translated to touch controls with appropriate prompts for actions and menus. That said, this mobile edition is also available for PC as an emulated title, with full support for cross-progression across Android, iOS, and PC.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nDark and Light Mobile provides players with a vast and open world to explore, featuring diverse landscapes and environments, from lush forests to desolate deserts. Players can gather resources from the world, and then craft weapons, gear, items; build houses and bases; and capture variety of magical creatures, which can then become your loyal companions or mounts\r\n## 👶Initial Experience\r\nThere is a quest guide system implemented that serves as an excellent introductory guide for beginners. Players can choose to follow it or play at their own pace. My experience has been on both sides; I followed the tutorial but gradually began doing more things on my own as I learned more about the game. At the start, players are placed on a beginner server and eventually allowed to move to a \"Peaceful\" PvE server. Dark and Light also offers PvPvE servers where player raids and guild wars take place.  After just a few hours, I had already built a cozy house on top of a hill overlooking the starting village, complete with my flying pet that I could ride on.\r\n## ⏫Addicting but grindy progression\r\nI find resource gathering and character progression addicting in this game, driven by the desire to unlock new gear, modules, and to power up your character. Players can progress by accumulating XP to level up and unlocking new crafting recipes as they choose to learn new skills through a linear list of technologies and fields. This involves spending research points and resources to further enhance your learning rates. The more resources you invest, the greater the experience gained. Research points do run out and must be replenished either by waiting it out or through in-game currency.\r\nThe entire crafting and leveling system is complex, and this complexity intensifies as you level up. The poorly scaled UI with its small buttons further exacerbates the problem. Higher level items and buildings will require higher level resources, and these resources will require certain equipment to synthesize, up to the lowest resource denominator. The game demands time and effort to gather resources and accomplish tasks, so be prepared for some serious grinding when playing this game.\r\n## 💻📲 Controls, Combat and differences with the PC version\r\nThe gameplay is slightly different from the PC version, but it's still very clearly Dark and Light in its core. The gameplay has been optimized for touch controls and is somewhat less action-oriented than its PC counterpart. Combat and gathering are now carried out through touch screen prompts, which lock you into an animation instead of allowing free movement while attacking or interacting. This makes the system feel clunkier and less responsive. At its current state, I don't find the combat segment enjoyable. In terms of environmental interaction, there seems to be an extra step in many actions, particularly when gathering items or using equipment. There is definitely room for improvement in streamlining these processes.\r\nWith these feedbacks, it’s notable to mention that the version that I played is still noticeable a work in progress. Additionally, a small number of texts, dialogues, and tutorial videos remain incomplete or just use computer-generated voices.\r\n## 💵Monetization model\r\nI’m not really certain if this game will be released as a free-to-play game, especially since the original PC version cost money upfront on Steam, but this mobile version certainly looks to do so, judging from how the foundations are in place.\r\nCertain aspects of gameplay and monetization may continue to evolve until the release. However, it's evident that the foundations for premium currencies and cosmetics are already in place. As spending money can directly impact progression rates, this game has the potential to become a pay-to-win scheme, particularly for hardcore PvPvE players.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDark and Light Mobile has the potential to provide an enjoyable and immersive survival crafting sandbox experience for both PvP and PvE players. However, its success will depend on how well it addresses the issues and concerns raised during its development and how it balances its monetization methods. Nevertheless, players seeking a mobile sandbox adventure with both solo and multiplayer options can look forward to trying this game once it is released.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6333257) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Party Animals is a multiplayer physics-based brawler and party game developed by Recreate Games and published by Source Technology. This game brings a delightful selection of cute anthropomorphic animals in chaotic battles, similar to like Gang Beasts and Gummy Life. With its unique blend of physics-based combat and Fall Guys-style objectives, it offers players a hilariously chaotic fun experience.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Really, really fun, hilarious too\r\n- Cute fluffy animals for its characters\r\n- Graphics are incredibly overdetailed and overkill\r\n- A great deal of fun and variety in the maps\r\n- Eliminated players can still participate and play with their own mini-game## Cons\r\n- The controls feel floaty and can be hard to grasp especially at the beginning\r\n- Map design can be somewhat frustrating at times\r\n- Confusing teamplay system\r\n- No Offline play\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art style\r\nIn terms of the casual art style that the game aims for, the graphics are incredibly overdetailed. You could say that it’s a bit of overkill for this type of game, but it looks impressive nonetheless. Party Animals easily stands out in terms of graphics and art style due to its incredible attention to detail, realistic fur rendering, well-executed motion blur, and impressive lighting effects. Even the Black Hole featured in one of the maps had proper light bending around it, Just wow!\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay is where Party Animals is at its best, offering players a dose of mindless chaotic fun. It’s really really fun! You will literally shout and scream while playing this game, at least that’s what happened to me, and I don’t normally do that while playing.\r\nThe physics-based combat system allows you to engage in melee combat, punch, toss, jump, kick, and headbutt opponents, all while taking advantage of the physics engine for unpredictable and hilarious battles. Players can also pick up weapons scattered and randomly spawned around the arena; swing, shoot, and throw them at your enemies, or even your friends. The addition of weapons and environmental hazards adds to the madness, and the randomness of it all pretty much evens the playing field for players of all skill levels, from beginner children to sweaty hardcore gamers. However it can still get a bit frustrating from time to time, especially when taking the controls into the equation.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe controls can be quite complicated and hard to grasp, especially at the beginning. While you can perform basic actions like moving, punching, and picking up objects, there are also complex maneuvers such as drop kicks, running power punches, and the ability to pick up and use weapons. Unfortunately, the controls lack responsiveness and can feel somewhat floaty, even more so than your typical physics-based game. The characters often feel very heavy, and aiming punches, throws, and kicks often results in unfavorable and unwanted outcomes.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nAs for the maps and modes, they offer a great deal of fun and variety. There are nine maps for each of the two main game modes (duo and squad), along with two maps designed for the third game mode called Arcade. These maps feature numerous gimmicks, including a Black Hole that occasionally sucks everything, a wooden hanging bridge that gradually collapses, and sports-inspired matches where players compete to score goals against each other.\r\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, the map design can be somewhat frustrating at times. Players often find themselves at the mercy of these powerful environmental hazards. With very limited control over these elements, anyone can easily die unexpectedly and quite randomly. The game is undeniably fun, but frustratingly chaotic fun.\r\n## 💀 Dead but not forgotten\r\nWhen players get eliminated, I do love how they give these eliminated players something to do instead of just spectating. Eliminated players are introduced to a small mini-game where they can continue to interact with the game by attempting to knock other players out by throwing items into the arena.\r\n## 🎭 There is no ”I” in TEAM, but there’s an M.E. in it\r\nThe game modes are fun and varied, but they rely too much on teamplay without giving players an avenue for proper teamwork. More often than not I’ve had confused teammates who have absolutely no idea I was friendly and tried to eliminate me, and I was more of the same at times. There should be a better indicator on who’s a teammate and who’s not, and the ability to queue single and teamplay separately.\r\nWhile there is a traditional solo free-for-all game mode, you're more likely to encounter team-based games. However, it's worth noting that you still have the option to create custom matches if you really want to, and fill it with bots as well. Unfortunately, despite the initial marketing description for the game, there is no true offline play, which means the game is always-online.\r\n## 💵 A “Paidmium” game\r\nThe game costs $20 upfront on all platforms, which is reasonable for the content and fun the game offers. However, I do find that the microtransactions are somewhat aggressive, considering that it's already a paid game. Fortunately, these microtransactions are limited to cosmetics, so we can overlook them.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nParty Animals offers a frustratingly hilariously chaotic fun multiplayer experience with its fluffy cast of anthropomorphic animals. it does have its share of quirks, such as the challenging controls, level design, and confusing teamplay system. It doesn't quite dethrone classics like Gang Beasts or Fall Guys, but it stands as a competent alternative with notably superior graphics.  With its reasonable price point, Party Animals provides good value and an entertaining option for those looking for light-hearted multiplayer fun.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6332935) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Zenless Zone ZeroGlobal\r\n8.2\r\nAnime\r\nAction\r\nPC Version\r\n## 💤What is Zenless Zone Zero?\r\nZenless Zone Zero (ZZZ for short) transports players to a post-apocalyptic futuristic metropolis known as New Eridu. In this ravaged world, humanity faces the relentless onslaught of otherworldly beings known as the Ethereal, who emerge from enigmatic portals called Hollows. These formidable creatures have wreaked havoc, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction. However, a resilient group of survivors has formed New Eridu, a bastion against the Ethereal threat. Their survival hinges on extracting technology and resources from their enigmatic foes. ZZZ is expected for release on PC and mobile, but that’s not all, as the game was also announced for consoles during the on-going Tokyo Game Show this year.\r\nZZZ was recently showcased during this year's Tokyo Game Show alongside other HoYoverse games, with its own 20-minute segment. Judging from the live chat on the Youtube stream, oh boy, fans are clearly extra hyped about their favorite titles, both upcoming and ongoing!\r\n## 🏬The Last Bastion of Humanity\r\nNew Eridu stands as a beacon of hope, offering hospitality, openness, and freedom to disaster refugees, the displaced, and survivors from other settlements. The city thrives with a diverse population, shaped by both the wonders of Ether technology and the remnants of the old civilization. But in this ideal urban paradise, danger lurks in the shadows, from menacing gangs to the treacherous Hollow Raiders and conspirators.\r\n## 🧟The Danger\r\nThe Hollows themselves are catastrophic phenomena, bizarre spherical dimensions that emerge suddenly, devouring everything in their path. Inside these Hollows, the fabric of space-time becomes chaotic, mutating people and spawning dangerous mutant creatures known as the Ethereal. Well, aside from these monsters, we also have the aforementioned thugs and criminals as threats.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nZenless Zone Zero offers a visually pleasing gameplay experience that combines urban exploration with high-stakes combat. Players step into the shoes of a Proxy, a character tasked with aiding others in their exploration of the perilous Hollows that will serve as dungeons. As you progress, you'll assemble a team of diverse stylish characters, each with their own unique and flashy colorful abilities. Teamwork is key as you strategically combine these abilities to unleash devastating damage and intricate combos on your Ethereal adversaries.\r\n## 🎨Visually Stunning\r\nThe gameplay is touted as action-packed and visually stunning, and watching the gameplay videos, I have to strongly agree. From the fluid animations to seamless menu transitions and eye-catching colorful visual effects, ZZZ sets a high bar for aesthetics. I was particularly impressed by the attention to detail in the art style and color palettes. However fluid it looks though, the responsiveness of controls remains a key aspect to look out for in the actual gaming experience. If it’s anything close to what we’ve seen in HoYoverse games, it’s bound to be good.\r\nBeyond the adrenaline-pumping battles, players will also have the opportunity to explore New Eridu itself. Engage in a variety of side activities, such as arcade games or eating at restaurants, to further immerse yourself in this somewhat vibrant, post-apocalyptic world.\r\n## 📺Tokyo Game Show 2023\r\nDuring the show, the voice actresses of two main characters, Yuka Iguchi (Japanese voice actress of Koleda) and Yumi Igarashi (Japanese actress cast of Corin), made special appearances. They shared insights into some of the characters in ZZZ's story. Additionally, they shed light on New Eridu, the last urban civilization in the game.\r\n## 🎮Console release! (Alongside PC and Mobile)\r\nPerhaps the biggest announcement of the segment (albeit towards the end of the showcase) was the confirmation of a console release for Zenless Zone Zero. While the exact console and release date wasn't specified, given miHoYo's track record, it's highly likely that it will make its way to PS5.\r\nWith Genshin Impact already on PS5 and Honkai: Star Rail set to arrive in October, PlayStation players are in for a treat. A Switch version though? Also very likely and probably going even further and probably releasing on the upcoming Switch successor, that last part was just my speculation from me though.\r\nZenless Zone Zero is poised to be another HoYoverse hit as an urban fantasy action RPG. With its promise of a rich narrative, immersive world-building, and engaging gameplay, it's a title that is worth looking out for, especially that it’s now coming for a lot of platforms.\r\nVisit here for more information about TapTap's Picks from Tokyo Game Show 2023!\r\nVisit here\r\nTokyo Game Show with TapTap Exclusive Deep Dive\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6334021) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Metal Mind\r\n8.7\r\nPixel\r\nRPG\r\nPre-register\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nMetal Mind is a pixel rogue-lite stick shooter where players take on the role of a mech that can change its parts and gear on the fly. The game was originally released on PC (Steam) last year for an upfront cost of $18, but I had the privilege of trying out a pre-release build of the Android version, and I must say, it transitions quite seamlessly to the mobile platform, if not even better suited for it.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Charmingly simple retro art-style\r\n- Plethora of unlockable guns and robot appendages\r\n- Experimentation and freedom to swap out robot parts\r\n- Enemies are varied enough to necessitate the use of different weapons\r\n- Auto-aim mechanic, making it a “single-stick” shooter## Cons\r\n-The persistent upgrades feel somewhat underwhelming\r\n-Minor bugs and some crashes (still a pre-release version)\r\n## 📝Notable points:\r\n## ✨Will probably be a free-to-play title with ads\r\n## ✨Release date not yet announced\r\n## 🎨Visuals\r\nMetal Mind's art style is charmingly simple with its retro pixel design, and the soundtrack complements the action nicely. However, one area where it could use improvement is localization. Despite setting the game to English, a significant portion of the text remains in Chinese, which can be confusing, especially when trying to understand game mechanics.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay mechanics in Metal Mind follow a classic twin-stick shooter formula, but with a twist. It’s actually a “single-stick” shooter because aiming is already done automatically. You just have to fire the weapon, or activate abilities. Character movement is controlled using the left stick, and shooting, dodging, and ability with the right part of the screen. Because of the auto-aim mechanic, the controls feel really responsive and right at home as a casual mobile rogue-lite experience. Of course, this comes at a strategic cost of not being able to manually aim at enemies.\r\n## 🦿 Everything fits in this Robot\r\nThe game mechanics are actually decent for a rogue-lite, encouraging experimentation and freedom to swap out parts. As you progress through the game's ever-changing map and clear room after room, the player is presented with upgrade pickups that can change the mech’s actual body part. Swap your mech parts out for different bonuses and purposes, or if perhaps you simply just like the looks.\r\nThe weapons also come into play and feature a variety of projectile styles and even melee weapons like laser swords. The game allows you to equip two weapons at the same time and switch between them during combat, although I found the switching process is somewhat slow. Some weapons are extra powerful but shoot very slowly, some shoot very long lasers that bounce on walls, some have rapid fire but deal damage in small amounts. I find every weapon viable, it just depends on the enemy types which are also varied enough to necessitate the use of these different weapons. There is a cooldown/overheat mechanic in most weapons, and each of them behaves very differently. In this game, you can't simply continuously press the fire button without caution.\r\nPersistent progression in Metal Mind isn't just about luck; it's about skill and strategy. Accumulate points to enhance your skill tree after each run, making minor but crucial adjustments to stats such as damage, attack speed, armor, and movement. They’re really really minor, only single digit percentages of increase, but crucial nonetheless. I would have liked more substantial amounts of upgrades though. You also have the option to purchase some weapons to start runs with, providing a head start on your adventure.\r\n## 💵Is it free-to-play or paid like the PC version?\r\nWhile Metal Mind is a paid experience on Steam, it sure looks like it will adopt a free-to-play model on mobile, but don’t quote me on that, this is just my speculation. because I’m seeing ads whenever I die, and there's even the option to watch more ads to boost your progression and acquire additional skill points. This choice may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a common approach in mobile gaming.\r\nThe core gameplay loop in Metal Mind is undeniably enjoyable and addictive. With a plethora of unlockable guns, quirky robot appendages, customizable load-outs, skill synergies, secrets, challenging enemies, and charismatic characters, the game offers a wealth of content to keep players engaged. However, it's worth noting that there are some minor bugs, although nothing that breaks the overall experience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nMetal Mind is a charming mobile rogue-lite that shines in its robot-building aspect and diverse gameplay possibilities. It's a fun and engaging experience with the potential to become even better with further improvements. When it finally releases and it turns out that it’s really free-to-play, then there’s no more question that this game is worth your try.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6336400) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "title": "[Indie Spotlight] Rhythm and Storytelling for your ears | Review - Concerto on White (Demo)",
    "description": "I was fortunate enough to be able to try out the Android demo for the upcoming Concerto on White, and I was pleasantly impressed by its blend of rhythm-based gaming, musical simulation, and visual novel style storytelling.",

    "body": "Concerto on White\r\n8.4\r\nMusic\r\nRhythm\r\nDownload\r\nI was fortunate enough to be able to try out the Android demo for the upcoming Concerto on White, and I was pleasantly impressed by its blend of rhythm-based gaming, musical simulation, and visual novel style storytelling.\r\n## 📖Story\r\nConcerto on White starts off your character as a newly accepted — rejected rather — applicant of a prestigious musical university. But somehow this decision gets mysteriously overturned and you find yourself still enrolled. It’s our first day, and we meet the professor and his teaching assistant for our first music class. Of course, part of the gameplay is experiencing slice-of-life-esque adventurous campus life in this prestigious music academy, and I’m also seeing traces of date sim elements, especially with the female characters. However, the game isn’t a slice-of-life experience as it may seem, as it plunges the player into an intriguing larger-than-life mystery early on.\r\n## 📕🎶Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay consists of two main ideas blended into one harmonious composition. The school academy life, and actual rhythm game gameplay. The school academy life is where you can attend classes, interact with your schoolmates, and practice music, all presented in a chapter-style visual novel storytelling. Currently, the story is not voice-acted, so you'll need to read the dialogue. The soundbits are amazingly done though and uses each character's special instruments as their dialogues slowly overlay on the screen. The rhythm game segments on the other hand are accessible as also part of the story chapters and during free-play mode.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe rhythm game mechanics are quite novel in its design and concept. Fun, engaging, and quite relaxing too! Unlike any typical rhythm games, players are required to actually play the melody with the right notes, although the process is still very simplified. On the left side, which looks like a vertical set of Piano keys, you swipe it up and down to align the proper key to the center reticle, and proceed to hit the corresponding colors on the right side that represents the pitch, either blue, green, or red (pressed outside).\r\nThis means your left hand is constantly adjusting the keys up and down while your right is hitting the correct notes at the right time. The whole mechanic is quite confusing at the start, and I needed a second run of the tutorials to finally get it. Once it clicks though, it’s as easy as any other rhythm game. I was only able to experience the easier pieces in the demo — so no finger bending songs and difficulties to conquer yet — but so far I have enjoyed the short-lived experience.\r\n## 🚧Early Access plans\r\nMastery of the gameplay is important, as it is required to proceed with the story mode. Although I hope they can include a skip or easy mode, for those who’d want to focus on the story only or are having a hard time progressing. This suggestion is likely to be made by many players, especially considering that Concerto on White is scheduled to release on Steam next year in Early Access form. Initially, the game will feature five story chapters, each lasting 10-15 minutes. The long-term plan is to expand it to a total of 21 chapters in the full version.\r\nConcerto on White boasts a partner system where the characters in the game will serve as accompanist when you play depending on the piece, in both the story and the free play mode. They all represent a certain musical instrument and a genre. The Early Access plans to include 3 partners, with 10 being the target for the full version. Each partner will have their own musical pieces that you can play, 20 initially then expanding to 50 upon official release. The game also plans to include an editor for custom pieces, so the total piece  number is practically open-ended.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThere’s not much known about the game beyond that, and it’s exciting to see what’s to come, especially with how the story will play out and with more musical pieces to play. Concerto on White promises a captivating fusion of rhythm, storytelling, and musical exploration. It's a game worth keeping an ear on. As the game heads into Early Access on Steam next year, it leaves us eager to discover how this harmonious composition will evolve.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6336248) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Notably, Schneider, one of the prominent Arcanist characters in the trailer, impressively sports an Italian accent.\r\nIn line with the established art design of the game, the visuals throughout the trailer are nothing short of superb. The character designs are presented in a soft Anime style, with subtle hints of HD-2D, all set against high-quality pre-rendered CG backgrounds that masterfully evoke the game's atmosphere. Complementing the visuals is the background music, a lo-fi soul piece that perfectly captures the dark and noir tone of the trailer. The overall cinematic quality of the trailer actually feels like a Hollywood production.\r\nThe trailer is short and quite brief, showing a quick montage of the backward time-traveling journey players are about to embark on. It offers glimpses of New York being deconstructed, World War 2 scenes, and even the beauty of rain falling upwards.

I had the opportunity to play a seemingly very early version of the game, which is currently in development, and it holds a lot of promise. The game is planned for release on both mobile and PC (Steam), although a clear release timeline has not been provided yet.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nThe premise blends the unlikely combination of high fantasy with sci-fi, and it works out quite well. Two allied factions, Neoterrans and Wokens, are at war against a mysterious alien civilization. Your character is one of the few powerful fighters remaining after a mysterious defeat at the hands of the enemy's leader.  It might appear daunting and unusual at first, but this uniqueness is what makes it a refreshing addition to storytelling premises and world-building. Thinking about it, the whole premise, even the character designs seems heavily inspired by the Phantasy Star Online series of games.\r\nStarting out, players must choose between these two factions, and they are born into and fight for it, with the aim of becoming the most powerful Star Warrior. The power armor and energy cores are the main centerfolds of the progression and character power. You have the freedom to create your own character (up to five on the same account), customize them, and level them up.\r\nAfter choosing the faction, players create characters of either gender with customizable appearances. Additionally, players select their character identity, which determines their class. As a solo player, I preferred the assault role over defense or support roles. Apart from the role, players can also choose from a variety of weapons, shaping their combat style and moves. I was only able to play solo, but there is an option for creating a party with other players to raid rifts together.\r\n## 📺Gameplay Presentation, Combat and Graphics\r\nThe combat is already highly satisfying at this early stage; the controls are responsive. Even with less than ideal performance running a 720p graphics preset, it still was enjoyable. The animations are solid, featuring flashy attack sequences done impressively. However, the running speed appears hilariously fast. In which they even double down on this concept by introducing an ability that will even make you run even faster that you look like The Flash, this combined with the auto-pathing they made for the objectives creates a genuinely hilarious, fun, and relaxed experience. I actually like it! It’s hilarious how my character keeps overshooting its autopathing destinations while boosted, cause she’s ridiculously fast.\r\nDuring combat, there is a high level of visual clutter that can make it challenging to track the action, particularly when trying to monitor enemy attacks for dodging. Moving beyond that, the graphics are detailed and crisp, but they may lean toward being excessively clean without much graphical effects and post-processing. In that aspect, it sometimes looks like somethin that came out of the PS2 or PS3 era. Notably, there are significant texture and model pop-ins, with a very close draw distance. It's crucial to remember that this game is still in its early stages of development, and improvements are likely. I can't deny though that some of the details are already gorgeous to look at.\r\n## 📜It’s still under development\r\nWhile the core gameplay remains intact, and there's a hint of fun to be had already, it's important to note that the game is still very buggy and incomplete. I experienced disconnects every few minutes of playing, and many aspects are either not yet implemented or merely acting as placeholders. For instance, the traders are present, but trading with some of them isn't possible. Additionally, one rift — essentially a dungeon — required me to defeat specific monsters for a full 3-star rating, but these monsters fail to spawn. Furthermore, only the first hour's worth of the main campaign is accessible. On one occasion, I even encountered a crash that returned me to the main menu while in conversation with a character, and the character's dialogue continued regardless. It's worth noting that these issues are understandable given the early stage of game development.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nAs for the monetization model, it's likely that this game is adopting the free-to-play model with microtransactions. I haven't noticed any gacha mechanics, but the groundwork for a stamina system and premium currency is already in place.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWhere does that lead us? Well, the game is very, very promising. Despite the current technical issues and incompleteness, Starstride manages to deliver an enjoyable and unique gaming experience. The blend of fantasy and sci-fi, the engaging combat, and the potential for character customization make it a title to keep an eye on.\r\nAs the game continues to develop and the developers address the existing issues, Starstride could easily become a hit when it finally releases. If they can maintain this level of promise throughout the development process, we may have a future gem on our hands.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6345123) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "EA SPORTS FC™ Mobile SoccerGlobal 8.1 Editors' Choice Sports Download",

    "body": "EA SPORTS FC™ Mobile SoccerGlobal\r\n8.1\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nSports\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nEA SPORTS FC™ MOBILE 24, the latest installment in the longstanding FIFA series —now with a fresh name — has made quite an impression with its recent release — or rather, update today, September 26. If you’re wondering why FIFA Mobile is being rebranded to a new franchise called EA SPORTS FC™, It’s because EA Sports and FIFA revealed last year that their long-standing licensing agreement would come to an end on December 31, 2022.  For existing players of FIFA 23 Mobile, the transition to the EA Sports FC version will be seamless. The game is available as an update on the App Store or Play Store, allowing players to continue their football journey without losing their progress as such as account names and many unlocks and purchases.\r\nFor more information about what carries over and what doesn’t, check further down below towards the end of the Review.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nOne of the first things that catch the eye when starting EA SPORTS FC™ MOBILE 24 is the graphics. Designed for mobile devices, it manages to deliver impressive graphics and art that rival some console experiences. Player models are rich in detail, and the animations are adequately lifelike, but not without general jankyness.\r\nWhile it's important to note that it may not match the level of detail seen in the console versions or the next-gen EA SPORTS FC™ 24, it is undoubtedly a visual spectacle on mobile devices. It’s not aiming for a hyper realistic graphics, but the details are there and I would say well made.\r\nThe developers understand the diverse range of devices on which players engage with the game and have addressed this by offering an extensive graphics customization setting. From Power Saver to Ultra graphics, and the option for up to 60 frames per second on capable devices, they've left no stone unturned in catering to player preferences. Personally, I’ve had no issues running the game on max graphics and frame rate on my Snapdragon 888 machine, even while charging.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nStarting the game, it literally “Kicks off” with a series of training challenges. Before unlocking many of the game modes, the game requires you to complete a fairly swift but helpful set of training challenges, which actually helped me a lot in understanding the game mechanics a bit better. This feature was notably barebones during the beta last month, so understanding the mechanics was easier for me this launch time.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe touch-based controls in the game are intuitive and responsive, allowing players to execute a wide range of actions with relative ease. These actions include passes, tackles, shots, and skill moves. The game offers multiple control options, catering to different playstyles. Players can choose between virtual buttons or gesture-based controls, ensuring that everyone can find a suitable control scheme that suits their preferences. Just like the graphics, it’s not aiming for hyper realism and more like aims for a fun arcade experience instead.\r\nOnce the initial tutorial challenges were completed, I was free to do my own thing, either by playing one of the two core game modes, or playing the new campaign game mode \"UEFA Champions League\", which is perhaps is my favorite game mode for the whole game.\r\n## ⚽Core Game Modes\r\nEA SPORTS FC™ MOBILE 24 revolves around managing Teams in various aspects, including team customization, player collection gachas, formation strategies, skill moves, player development, and more.  Players collect player cards through packs, events, and the in-game market. As they acquire more player cards, they can improve their starting lineup and overall team rating.\r\nThe game features two core game modes to play your Teams in: VS Attack and Head to Head. These modes will feel instantly familiar to fans of the previous FIFA Mobile games, effectively carrying forward the gameplay format into this new era.\r\nVS Attack: This mode provides a real-time indirect battle between your team and the opponents. Both teams rush to score goals against AI-controlled defenders, making matches fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping. The short duration of each half is perfect for quick gaming sessions on the go.\r\nHead to Head: In contrast to VS Attack, this mode offers a direct battle between your team and opponents. Here, both teams compete directly, taking on both defensive and offensive roles against each other in real-time. It's a departure from the indirect style of VS Attack, offering a more hands-on football experience.\r\nVS Attack: This mode provides a real-time indirect battle between your team and the opponents.

Here, both teams compete directly, taking on both defensive and offensive roles against each other in real-time. It's a departure from the indirect style of VS Attack, offering a more hands-on football experience.\r\n## 🏆 The UEFA Champions League campaign\r\nAside from other returning game modes such as Manager Mode, What truly sets EA SPORTS FC™ MOBILE 24 apart from previous iterations and competitors is the introduction of the UEFA Champions League campaign. This mode takes players on a journey from the Group Stage all the way to the Final. It captures the essence of this prestigious tournament, allowing you to lead your chosen club to glory.\r\nThe key highlight here is the inclusion of REAL players with REAL stats. You can take control of one of the qualified clubs, or opt for a non-qualified team, which replaces one of the original clubs in the Group Stage draw. This twist adds a layer of unpredictability to the tournament, breaking away from the traditional club management progression found in other football games.\r\nThe introduction of the UEFA Champions League campaign is a refreshing addition that provides a break from the monotony of managing your own club and the grind often associated with \"pay-to-win\" player upgrades. It's a nod to the diversity of football experiences players seek.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nEA SPORTS FC™ MOBILE 24 still features the traditional free-to-play model, offering players the option to acquire virtual currency or packs in exchange for real money. This is a standard practice in free-to-play titles and aims to help in progression and enhance the team by obtaining top-rated players.\r\nThe game features lots of moving parts with regards to the game's monetization. With numerous rewards, currencies, and mechanics that might seem overwhelming at first glance. However, past FIFA mobile games have been relatively generous with free rewards, ensuring that players who choose not to spend real money can still enjoy the game. Progression wise? That’s another story.\r\nAdditionally, quests, leagues, events and campaigns provide varied challenges, rewarding players with unique items and players for their accomplishments for even as simple as logging in daily. Still, some players may feel tempted to spend real money to improve their teams.\r\n## 💱 Progression transfers from FIFA 23 to EA SPORTS FC™ MOBILE 24\r\nWith the update, the progression from FIFA 23 to EA SPORTS FC™ MOBILE 24 is designed to be seamless, ensuring that players can continue their football journey without losing their progress. Here's how the progression transfer works, what resets and what doesn’t:\r\nCarry Overs:\r\nPlayers' account data, including their account names and many unlocks and purchases, will carry over from FIFA 23 to EA Sports FC Mobile. This means you won't have to start from scratch and can pick up where you left off.\r\nFIFA Points Balance - Your remaining FIFA Points balance will also carry over. This is essential for players who have invested in FIFA Points and want to continue using them in the new game.\r\nNow and Later Points and Players - Any Now and Later Points and Players you have acquired in FIFA 23 will be retained and can be used in EA Sports FC Mobile.\r\nPlayers' account data, including their account names and many unlocks and purchases, will carry over from FIFA 23 to EA Sports FC Mobile.

For existing players, the transition is seamless. For new players, diving in is easy and just as seamless too with its helpful tutorials. Diverse game modes, including the impressive UEFA Champions League campaign, cater to varied player preferences and spending habits. With a rich arcade football experience that blends tradition and innovation, EA SPORTS FC™ MOBILE 24 deserves recognition, especially for football fans looking for the go-to Arcade football game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6359942) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nThe Wreck is a 3D interactive visual novel that plunges players into a world of complex emotions, family dynamics, and personal reflection. It was originally released on Steam and consoles early this year, but has now made its way to Android here on TapTap, offering players a chance to experience its narrative-driven journey on the go. You can play the first few parts of the story for free (roughly 20 minutes), then purchase access for the full version.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Compelling and profound narrative, after the initial slow crawl\r\n- Great presentation and immersive soundtrack\r\n- Quality voice acting and writing## Cons\r\n- Choices doesn’t feel like real choices and doesn’t matter, more like there for the sake of interaction only\r\n- Forced interactivity sometimes takes you out of the immersion instead of immersing you\r\nImmediately upon starting it, I can already sense the vibe that it's going to be a fantastic narrative-driven slice-of-life gaming experience, similar to past titles I've reviewed here on TapTap, such as Stray Gods and Road 96. While the soundtrack plays an impressive role in setting the mood, it does take a backseat once the game starts and for the majority of it, allowing the dialogue and character interactions to immerse players with ambient and white noise instead.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nVisually, The Wreck makes a strong impression as a 3D visual novel. The style is a mix of cel-shaded, hand paint-like aesthetics and cartoons, while the cinematography adds depth to the storytelling, with its intriguing and “floaty” camera angles that create a unique atmosphere.\r\nHowever, it's worth noting that the game doesn't fully animate its characters, which includes their lips during dialogue, which can sometimes leave the visuals feeling slightly static.  They really are just 3D comic book panels with slight animated segments from time to time. Nevertheless, the overall quality of the graphics is decent, especially on a mobile device, which looks similar to the PC version.\r\n## 📖Story\r\nThis game is a masterclass in being a narrative-driven experience. It explores themes of family, loss, acceptance, grief, and survival with complete groundedness. Personally, this hits right at home for me, as I have a similar thing that happened to me, so the emotional impact is magnified.\r\nThe game takes players on a journey through the protagonist Junon's life — a scriptwriter writing her literal own story, skillfully blending past, present, and future through recurring memories, flashbacks, and introspection. The storytelling is thought-provoking and emotionally charged, delving deep into themes of anger, guilt, and self-acceptance.\r\nWhile players might initially find the pacing slow and the narrative structure disjointed, I encourage you to push through the first hour because once the story clicks into place, it becomes an unforgettable experience. It’s unfortunate that the free demo of this game, which includes the first twenty minutes of the story, is part of this initial slow crawl, potentially deterring would-be buyers from fully realizing this experience. Overall, the game will take 4-5 hours to finish.\r\nThe Wreck maintains an air of sophistication and class throughout its presentation. It doesn't shy away from tackling heavy subjects, and its portrayal of complex family relationships is both elaborate and realistic. The game's dedication to these themes is highly commendable, albeit admitted it's not going to be a popular topic for many just looking for a fun game to play.\r\nThe character development is exceptional, especially if you’re counting the entirety of the story including the recurring memories, retrospects, and flashbacks; however, I personally found the main character a bit annoying at first. This isn't a reflection of the writing quality, but rather her personality and the way she was portrayed. Of course, I was only judging her based on my first few impressions.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe Wreck offers a familiar but still fresh take on gameplay within the visual novel genre. Players interact with the story by occasionally tapping the screen to select words or objects to progress the scene. While this approach is refreshing, the game remains relatively linear, often feeling more like an interactive movie than a traditional game. Nonetheless, the game offers enough interaction and mechanics beyond the typical “choose your dialogue option”. However, it is a bit jarring to stare at the screen, listen to the dialogue, and totally get caught off guard by the sudden need to tap the screen again because I was so focused on the dialogue. This frequent interruption can disrupt the pacing of the conversations.\r\nThe game is FULL of dialogue, and as said earlier every few seconds you are asked to choose a word floating on screen to continue. Sometimes there is a whole metaphysical memory-like scene presented to you that flows on both sides and loops infinitely, you can either rewind the scene and forward it, and interact on fuzzy floating words that will come out to gain more insight about the character’s thoughts and memories. This mechanic, while novel, can occasionally feel frustrating when crucial words are easily missed and the words appear throughout the scene in seemingly chaotic order.\r\nWhile The Wreck offers the illusion of choice with multiple words to select in dialogues, it doesn't significantly impact the overall narrative direction. The game's linearity may disappoint those seeking branching storylines and lots of ending permutations. However, the story's emotional impact and the high standard of voice acting compensate for the limited interactivity and branches.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe Wreck is a game that delves deep into the human experience, offering a profound narrative journey that explores serious and depressing themes in people’s daily lives, and will surely resonate with those who had such experiences. Its storytelling is its greatest strength, and perhaps its one and only strength, immersing players in a world of complex emotions and family dynamics. It’s not really a “fun” video game that you will enjoy per se, or something that can entertain you on-the-go, it is rather a narrative experience for those who won't mind a darker, thought-provoking story.\r\nStray Gods\r\nRoad 96\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6364111) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This season promises a slew of engaging content, including the return of fan-favorite modes and the usual seasonal array of rewards to entice players.\r\n## 🧟Zombies Classic and Undead Siege\r\nOne of the biggest highlights is the return of both Zombies Classic and Undead Siege modes, both from past seasons. Zombies Classic was first introduced way back in November 2019, taking inspiration from the popular Zombie modes in the mainline games, while Undead Siege was introduced in 2021. These game modes have come and gone throughout the years and were not necessarily limited to Halloween periods.\r\nZombies Classic:\r\nEnter the classic round-based game mode set in Shi No Numa, also known as the Swamp of Death.

In this mode, operators must capture and control a moving point called the Patrol Zone. Points are scored by standing in the zone, and if it becomes contested, the team with more players on the objective continues to earn points.\r\nAdditionally, the ever popular Prop Hunt receives an update with new maps, props, and mechanics, adding fresh twists to the game. Ranked Search & Rescue is another exciting addition to the Ranked Multiplayer game modes, offering a new take on Search & Destroy.\r\nNew Themed Events\r\nSeason 9 brings three new events to participate in, offering rewards and temporary protection from Rank XP losses in Ranked Play.\r\nHalloween Themed Fright Factory Event: Earn Pumpkin Candy lottery tickets by completing challenges in Multiplayer and Battle Royale.

    "body": "With Halloween just around the corner, Call of Duty Mobile is now coming with a new update set to bring an eerie and action-packed experience to CODM players, with a recent trailer glimpsing of what's to come.\r\nThe trailer showcases a transformed Halloween version of one of Call of Duty Mobile’s maps — Standoff, bathed in moonlight, and exuding an ominous atmosphere. A jack-o'-lantern reaper statue, hanging bats, and eerie shadows adorn the map, adding a Halloween twist to the battleground.\r\nThe update, called Season 9 — Graveyard Shift, is set to launch on October 4 at 5 PM PT, bringing back fan-favorite modes like Zombies Classic and Undead Siege, along with new challenges and rewards. The Battle Pass includes unique Operator Skins and Weapon Blueprints. The return of Zombies Classic and Undead Siege alone is reason enough to get excited about the update, since zombies have been an underrated highlight of the Call of Duty franchise for years. This update is poised to bolster interest in the game, especially alone with the upcoming Call of Duty Warzone Mobile schedule this November.\r\nAs the trailer suggests, players can prepare to battle it out in style within Halloween Standoff and Haunted Hacienda, engage in new multiplayer modes, and unlock rewards. Call of Duty Mobile Season 9 promises to be a captivating and immersive Halloween-themed experience, available as the moon rises on October 4!\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6367308) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Counter-Strike 2\r\n8.5\r\nFPS\r\nMultiplayer\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nCounter-Strike 2 is the next step in the iconic online competitive shooter franchise Counter-Strike, and it's now here, available for everyone absolutely for free.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Seamless transition of player progression from CS:GO\r\n- Revamped and improved menu and game presentation\r\n- Quality of life improvements\r\n- Massive visual upgrades\r\n- Game-changing smoke mechanics\r\n- New tick-rate system for better online connectivity## Cons\r\n- Deletes CS:GO from existence, unlike CSS, and CS 1.6\r\n- No mention of a “revamped” solution to further combat cheaters\r\nCompared to Counter Strike: Global Offensive, or CS:GO, Almost every aspect has been revamped across the board with CS2, while still maintaining that familiar Counter-Strike feel that current CS:GO players are used to. Perhaps what’s better (or worse, more on that later), is that Counter-Strike 2 is just treated as a free content upgrade to CS:GO — this means players can easily dive right in with their previous content already transferring to the new update.\r\n## 🔀A Seamless Transition\r\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Counter-Strike and Valve is its commitment to its players and fans. It's essentially a free content upgrade that seamlessly integrates with your existing hard-earned cosmetics, ranks, and progression. However, this essentially deletes CS:GO from existence. Unlike CS: Source and the original CS 1.6, both of which you can still play anytime whenever you want on Steam, CS:GO will effectively be superseded by CS2 in all aspects, including the Steamapp id, page, and installation folders. There IS a workaround to revert its version back to CS:GO though, but only for demo viewing and test purposes.\r\n## 🎨Source 2 Engine visual upgrades (It’s been a long time coming)\r\nCounter-Strike 2 takes gameplay visuals to the next level. Visual effects across the board have received a makeover. With the introduction of Source 2 lighting and particle systems, everything from water to explosions, fire, smoke, muzzle flashes, bullet tracers, and impact effects looks and behaves in a new and immersive way.\r\n## 🅱️The revamped visuals also prioritizes readability and accessibility, drawing inspiration from recent competitive shooter titles like… dare I say, Valorant. Crucial details like bullet impacts at a distance and directional blood impacts that gradually fade provide players with essential information as they navigate the battlefield. This visual overhaul enhances the gameplay experience, ensuring that every move and shot is more defined. This also extends to the color palette used, which are more vibrant, light, and easier on the eyes, at least for me.\r\n## 💥The environmental effects in Counter-Strike 2 — explosions, fire, C4 lighting, and more have been reimagined using the Source 2 Engine as well. The result is an incredible visual fidelity and consistency that gives a better sense of immersion, while also catering to the eSports oriented nature of the game with regards to prioritizing visibility and accessibility over pure realism. I find it very well balanced.\r\n## 📜The menus and UI has also received a complete makeover. Fresh visual effects are scattered throughout the HUD, the presentation is also dialed down to 11 and fully geared towards providing a better competitive experience for both players and spectators alike, both in-game and outside the game. These trivial and minor details make the game look better but also effectively communicate important game state information. Even the buy menu is different now, and again dare I say takes inspiration from newer titles. (I can now refund weapons after an accidental buy, FINALLY)\r\n## 🏢Total maps makeover\r\nMaps are the lifeblood of Counter-Strike, and Counter-Strike 2 doesn't disappoint. The overhauled maps have been seemingly rebuilt from the ground up, leveraging the power of the Source 2 tools and rendering features. The maps have been upgraded with new Source 2 lighting, creating a realistic world filled with detailed materials, lighting, and reflections. With the maps, they have achieved a perfect balance of feeling familiar to old players while still feeling fresh and brand new.\r\n## 🔫 Weapons also get a makeover\r\nWeapons are at the heart of the Counter-Strike experience, and Counter-Strike 2 elevates them to a new level. All stock weapons have received high-resolution models, enhancing their visual appeal. Some weapon finishes take full advantage of these new models, delivering a fresh and exciting look. Every shot fired and every weapon wielded is now a visual spectacle. Your CS:GO inventory and cosmetics seamlessly transitions to Counter-Strike 2 too, benefiting from these visual improvements. Will the market value of these weapons change? Well let’s hope it does so I can sell some of my skins.\r\n## 🚬Smoke not only gets a makeover visually but also mechanically\r\nSmoke grenades in Counter-Strike 2 are no longer boring. They've become dynamic volumetric objects that interact with the environment, responding to lighting, gunfire, and explosions. This opens up exciting new tactical possibilities, as bullets and grenades can temporarily clear sightlines or manipulate smoke for strategic advantage. Smoke now behaves naturally, seeping through doorways, windows, stairs, and corridors, creating a more dynamic and competitive atmosphere.\r\n## 📶Sub-Tick Updates for a better online connectivity\r\nTick Rates have always been the bane of CS:GO’s matchmaking servers, only going up to 64 ticks, which mean it’s less accurate and reliable than the usual 128 tick server rates used in high-level play and external matchmaking platforms like FACEIT.  Counter-Strike 2 now introduces sub-tick updates, revolutionizing server responsiveness. Unlike traditional tick-based systems, sub-tick updates ensure that motion, shooting, and grenade throws are evaluated with pinpoint precision to the thousandth of a second. This means that regardless of the server's tick rate, your gameplay will always feel responsive and consistent.\r\n## 🎯Cheaters? Prime is still here\r\nWhile there’s no info about any improved anti-cheat measures aside from the usual measures like VAC, CS2 will still have Prime matchmaking, which helps significantly reduce the presence of hackers and cheaters within the game. This comes at the cost of essentially dividing the playerbase into free-to-play players and “Prime” players. Prime costs $14.99, and if you had this already with CS:GO, it will just carry over to Counter-Strike 2.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nValve still can’t count to three, but it’s perfectly fine with Counter-Strike 2, a much needed revitalization of the still popular but declining series. Featuring stunning upgraded visuals, enhanced gameplay mechanics, quality of life improvements, and backwards compatibility with your hard-earned CS:GO items.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6367705) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "EA SPORTS FC™ TacticalGlobal\r\n7.7\r\nSports\r\nTurn-Based Tactics\r\nPre-register\r\n## ✨Beta Overview\r\nEA Sports FC Tactical, previously known as EA Sports Tactical Football, is set to bring a refreshing turn-based twist to football games. Developed by KLab Inc in collaboration with EA, this game is currently undergoing early access testing in select regions and is gearing up for a global release. It promises to redefine the football gaming experience by introducing turn-based strategy elements into the mix.  EA is definitely set to expand its range of football mobile games; We last covered EA Sports FC Mobile here. Now, we are covering its tactical counterpart in this article.\r\n## 📊Performance\r\nEA Sports FC Tactical is very clearly still in its early build stage, as they didn’t even change the name yet in-game and it's still bearing the old branding of EA Sports Tactical Football. However, despite this, the game already demonstrates solid performance, even turned up to high graphics settings in my Snapdragon 888 device. I experienced smooth gameplay with a consistent 60fps, setting a positive tone for the overall experience. The gameplay is already solid and I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nVisually, the game holds its own against other football titles, perhaps similar looking to its counterpart real-time football game, EA Sports FC. However, what truly sets it apart is its dazzling cinematic approach to action and animations. The in-game sequences during matches have an over-the-top, almost anime-like quality. This unconventional presentation style is accompanied by upbeat music and a dazzling array of visual effects that add a unique charm to the game.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nEA Sports FC Tactical features a variety of game modes, including the World Tour single-player progression, friend matches, limited-time matches, and multi-game leagues. These diverse modes contribute to the overall gameplay format, coalescence into one gameplay format, the tactical turn-based matches.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay is pretty compartmentalized into player match-ups. In matches, player movement across the field is automated and presented in a coaching board style. However, when players encounter each other, the game shifts into an action-packed match-up mode. Here, players must choose from various actions, such as tackling, intercepting, dribbling, passing, or shooting, depending on their strategy. The outcome is determined by the actions chosen by both players and the players' ratings, adding a layer of strategy and predictability to each encounter.\r\nAs said earlier, the presentation during these matchups is nothing short of impressive. The animations that play out based on the results of these battles are dynamic and engaging. However, it's worth noting that after playing for a while, the animations will become repetitive, and you’ll probably want to skip them entirely. Fortunately, there's an option to double the game's speed or fully automate the gameplay, allowing players to focus on team strategy and power levels.\r\nOf course, the team’s rating is determined by their players' levels and overall quality, in which the game’s live service progression comes into play. It features traditional gacha gaming mechanics for collecting players and upgrading them through the use of materials. Login bonuses, passes, and events also exist to provide players with more rewards and avenues for grinding and spending money to progress. Furthermore, the game boasts an impressive roster of over 15,000 authentic football stars hailing from the top European football leagues, such as the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, and Serie A, providing players with a robust team management experience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nEA Sports FC Tactical, with its turn-based tactical approach to football gaming, brings a fresh perspective to the genre. While the early access version already demonstrates solid gameplay and stunning presentation, its full potential remains to be seen upon the global release. With EA's commitment to building an ecosystem around the game along with its real-time counterpart, the future looks promising. The key question is whether EA Sports FC Tactical can deliver on its promise of providing a new football experience with tactical strategy-based elements.\r\nEA Sports FC Mobile here\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6385420) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "IGNISTONE\r\n8.6\r\nAction\r\nAction Roguelike\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nIGNISTONE takes players on a journey into the heart of darkness, where they descend beneath the surface to the mines in search of the stolen Ignistone. This roguelike adventure promises a blend of strategy and skill in a simple package as you engage in one-on-one combat against thieving adversaries. While it may give off the visual vibes of classic PS2, Nintendo, or even early 2000’s flash games, IGNISTONE manages to instill a modern gameplay experience with its rogue-lite mechanics.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Only needs mouse; only 3 moves to master\r\n- Simple but challenging gameplay\r\n- A unique blend of persistent and temporary progression\r\n- Extra mini-games and facility upgrade mechanics## Cons\r\n- Some minor bugs and control shortcomings\r\n## 📖Story\r\nThere’s not much to tell about the story, only that the Ignistone has been stolen by a mysterious group of manipulated members of your own people, the Mame Tribe. It’s up to you and your companion to journey deep beneath the treacherous mines in search of the IGNISTONE. Despite its simplicity, the game manages to infuse a surprising amount of Ignistone lore into its lighthearted and child-friendly premise.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nThe game evokes distinct vibes reminiscent of the PlayStation 2 era, classic Nintendo games, and even the charm of Adobe Flash games, and it’s hard to tell exactly which, as it seems to amalgamate elements from all three elements. The lighthearted 2D cartoon cut-out aesthetics set the stage for a deceptively simple yet deep engaging gameplay experience.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game begins quite simply, offering only three basic moves: Attack, Parry/Block, and a Special Attack that becomes available once the meter is filled. It’s basically Dark Souls style of combat but stripped down of everything — including rolls and actual movement, leaving only attack and parry as the ONLY means of engagement. The game can be played entirely with just the mouse. However, don't be fooled into thinking it's overly simplistic, as there is a surprising depth to the gameplay that makes it both challenging and enjoyable.\r\nEach encounter with adversaries becomes a strategic head-on dance, demanding precise timing and mastery of your character's moves and the timing of the varied types of enemies. Some attack quickly, some have a very predictable telegraph, and others are outright confusing and hard to predict. Choosing the right moment to attack, parry, block, or unleash a special move can be the difference between success and defeat. Parry cancels the whole damage at the risk of taking full damage if unsuccessful, while regular blocks only mitigate the damage taken, so the character is not exactly safe.\r\nDescending deeper, every 5 levels, you get to choose from three randomized layouts of the next 5, be it filled with enemies, loot, or unknown elements, you have some degree of control of what's to come.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nAs a rogue-lite, IGNISTONE offers a unique blend of persistent and temporary progression. When your character meets their untimely demise in the depths, they are rescued by his companion and return to the safety of the village. Here, you retain your hard-earned currency called \"berries,\" and the progress to the last saved checkpoint, which occurs every 10 floors.\r\nHowever, there's a twist to this mechanic. Any weapons crafted during your perilous runs are forfeited, along with valuable crystals. This presents an intriguing challenge, as you must carefully consider when to retreat to the village and when to press onward. Venturing deeper into the caves yields more formidable adversaries but also brings you closer to the Ignistone.\r\nEvery 10 levels, the game provides you with the option to safely return to the village, offering a much-needed respite and allowing you to deposit your resources. However, it comes at a cost – any consumable mushrooms you possess are lost upon your return.  Overall, these mechanics strike a delicate balance between pushing your limits and returning to safety, choosing powerful weapons over weaker ones for safety, and deciding whether to advance or conserve non-persistent elements, fearing their loss in potentially challenging runs.\r\nInevitably, you'll lose weapons and shields, and you may find yourself farming lower levels for berries, crystals, and shards, often relying on wooden gear to avoid losses. It's a balancing act that adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. The decision of whether to continue your descent or return to the village is a constant source of tension and excitement.\r\nBeyond the core dungeon-crawling experience, IGNISTONE introduces other minor and major elements with the inclusion of mini-games and village upgrades. As you progress, you have the opportunity to enhance your town's facilities, including the Blacksmith, Amulet Robot, and Store.\r\nUpgrading these facilities unlocks access to a wider array of items and provides greater flexibility in the game's crafting system. For example, unlocking the exchange of hard-earned berries for various types of crystals, crafting amulets to gain passive modifiers, and upgrading facilities to equip more amulets and craft new weapons.\r\n## 🚧Shortcomings\r\nWhile IGNISTONE offers a thoroughly enjoyable gameplay experience, it is not without its minor flaws. I have encountered a game-breaking bug where after successfully parrying and activating a special move at almost the same time, I found myself unable to perform any actions during combat, leading to an unfortunate death. I was not able to reproduce this though so it might have been a rare bug.\r\nAnother notable issue is the game's somewhat amateurish control bindings. Pressing the Escape key abruptly closes the game without warning, making it all too easy to accidentally exit your play session. Additionally, IGNISTONE currently lacks controller support, despite its potential compatibility with a controller layout. This omission might disappoint players who prefer alternative input methods.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nIGNISTONE is a delightful and challenging roguelike adventure that successfully captures the essence of classic console and flash games and combines it with modern roguelites. Its seamless blend of simplicity and depth, coupled with the balance of persistence and temporary progression, results in an engaging and addictive experience. The incorporation of village-building elements and mini-games adds layers of variety to the gameplay, ensuring that players remain engaged for extended periods.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6384256) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "EA Sports FC Tactical is a football mobile game with a unique twist to it's gameplay. It's tactical turn-based instead of real-time.\r\nGameplay-wise, EA Sports FC Tactical introduces tactical turn-based matches.

While FIFA (Now called EA Sports FC) and eFootball prioritize offering an authentic soccer experience, Soccer Manager 2024 takes a more strategic and management-focused route. Sounds familiar? It might be because this concept is reminiscent of other popular 'manager' games like Football Manager 2023 or Basketball Manager 2023.\r\nSoccer Manager 2024 is tactical and methodical. Matches unfold at a pace that allows you to think strategically, you can pause the match at almost any time, looking at the 2D overview of the match. You'll find yourself pondering over each pass, each substitution, and each tactical adjustment. It's a cerebral experience, and if you're a fan of sports management simulations, you'll find it incredibly satisfying even though the visuals aren’t always in tantalizing 3D or in a fast-paced eye pleasing action.\r\nOne major difference is the absence of direct player control in Soccer Manager 2024. In EA Sports FC and eFootball, you can control players' movements with precision, executing intricate dribbles ,accurate passes, and stunning goals. In contrast, Soccer Manager 2024 limits your direct involvement to making tactical decisions and substitutions, albeit in a much more deeper manner. You watch the matches unfold as if you're a coach or manager in the stands rather than a player on the field.\r\nIn Soccer Manager 2024, your ability to strategize, make smart transfers, and build team chemistry takes center stage.

    "body": "Soccer Manager 2024 - Football\r\n8.1\r\nSports\r\nFootball\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nSoccer Manager 2024 offers a departure from the standard soccer sports video games. Unlike EA Sports FC and eFootball, which focus heavily on controlling the players on the field, Soccer Manager 2024 leans heavily into its title – it's all about managing the team. It's like taking on the role of a real-life soccer manager, making critical decisions that shape the destiny of your team. This concept is reminiscent of other 'manager' games like Football Manager 2023 or Basketball Manager 2023.\r\n## Pros\r\n- True sim approach to gameplay\r\n- Tactical Depth\r\n- Club, Team, and Manager customization\r\n- International Team Management## Cons\r\n- Limited Realism in Graphics and Animations\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay revolves around tactics, transfers, and team management. You're responsible for every aspect of your team's success or failure. From choosing the starting lineup to making strategic substitutions during matches, every decision matters.  Not only in-game but also outside the game. Managing your stadium, promotions, and sponsorships. This is where Soccer Manager 2024 shines – it forces you to think like a manager in charge of a soccer organization, not just a player.\r\nUnlike EA Sports FC and eFootball, which offer fast-paced, action-packed gameplay, Soccer Manager 2024 is tactical and methodical. Matches unfold at a pace that allows you to think strategically, you can pause the match at almost any time, looking at the 2D overview of the match. You'll find yourself pondering over each pass, each substitution, and each tactical adjustment. It's a cerebral experience, and if you're a fan of sports management simulations, you'll find it incredibly satisfying even though the visuals aren’t always in 3D or in a fast-paced action.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Presentation\r\nSpeaking of actual 3D graphics, this game still includes them, but they are primarily reserved for highlighting key in-game actions such as scoring goals, successful saves, and intense contact moments. The developers are boasting a graphical engine overhaul, however, the graphics and animations in Soccer Manager 2024 are, to put it mildly, still not its strong suit. While other soccer games strive for realism and meticulous player likenesses, this game seems to rank last in terms of realism and eye candy.\r\nIf you thought the graphics were a bit off, wait until you witness the animations. They are comically bad, in a way that might make you chuckle rather than cringe. Players move or rather —- slide — in rigid, robotic motions that are light-years away from the fluidity of their real-life counterparts. It's as if the players are action figures being played by a bunch of kids. It's evident that the focus here is on strategy and management, not on replicating the graceful dribbles and acrobatic goals you'd see in other soccer games.\r\n## 🕹A focus on Team Management and a departure from actual player control\r\nSoccer Manager 2024 proudly stands apart from EA Sports FC and eFootball in its approach to soccer gaming. While EA Sports FC and eFootball prioritize offering an authentic soccer experience, Soccer Manager 2024 takes a more strategic and management-focused route.\r\nOne major difference is the absence of direct player control in Soccer Manager 2024. In EA Sports FC and eFootball, you can control players' movements with precision, executing intricate dribbles and stunning goals. In contrast, Soccer Manager 2024 limits your direct involvement to making tactical decisions and substitutions. You watch the matches unfold as if you're a spectator in the stands rather than a player on the field.\r\nAdditionally, while EA Sports FC and eFootball feature extensive licensed teams, leagues, and player likenesses, Soccer Manager 2024 leans on generic teams and players, and this year the ability to customize the appearance of your own manager. You won't find every real-life club and superstar here. Instead, you'll be bound to create your own narrative with fictional teams and players. This can be a breath of fresh air for those who are tired of the same old licensed content, and the game feels more personal and customizable as a result. However, the game still allows players to take control of over 900 clubs hailing from 54 leagues across 36 countries around the world. Over 23k+ players have had their stats updated, and 6k+ players have been added to the game’s overall roster.\r\nIn a significant expansion for this year, Soccer Manager 2024 introduces the ability to manage international teams. Now, you can guide your national squad through major qualifiers and tournaments against the best international teams from around the world. This new feature opens up a world of possibilities, allowing you to put your managerial skills against the finest on the global stage.\r\nIn Soccer Manager 2024, your ability to strategize, make smart transfers, and build team chemistry takes center stage. It's a game for those who relish the challenge of managing a soccer club from top to bottom.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe core game itself is available for free, allowing players to dive into the world of soccer management without any upfront cost. However, there are in-app purchases in Soccer Manager 2024 that are present but not invasive, such as gold, energy boosts, cash for the team, a bundle of any of these, or buying a “premium version”. They offer players various options to enhance their experience, but crucially, they don't impose themselves on the gameplay. The game is entirely playable without spending a dime, making IAPs feel more like a compelling choice rather than a necessity. Of course, this still makes the game pay-to-win, as spending money still directly affects the progression.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nSoccer Manager 2024 might not win any awards for its graphics or animations, but it doesn't aim to compete in those areas. Instead, it carves out a unique space in the soccer mobile gaming genre by focusing on strategic team management. It offers a slower, more thoughtful experience. If you're a fan of soccer management simulations and can overlook the quirks in visuals, Soccer Manager 2024 is a game that will test your soccer team managerial skills.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6385905) Originally posted on TapTap.",

In this roguelite adventure, players engage in head-on 1v1 combat against thieving adversaries, utilizing a variety of swords and amulets to enhance their character's abilities.\r\nThe game's procedurally generated caverns are teeming with formidable enemies with different attack patterns and timings, rare items, and unexpected surprises, ensuring that no two Mine runs are alike.\r\nYou're armed with just three basic moves: Attack, Parry/Block, and a Special Attack once the meter is filled, the character cannot move, nor dodge attacks. The game is even entirely playable using just your mouse, and this simplicity allows for a quick start. However, don't be fooled – the game's true depth unfolds as you progress.\r\nIndeed the enemies in the mines are challenging, but Ignistone isn't solely about the procedural dungeon-crawling experience; it offers more, like mini-games and the upgrading of your town's facilities, such as the Blacksmith and Store, allow for deeper customization of your character's stats and modifiers.\r\nDespite its minor issues, such as occasional bugs and the absence of controller support, IGNISTONE offers an enticing journey into the depths that is looking like its worth the exploration. It's relatively easy to learn, but comes with a high payoff and satisfaction to be gained from its parry-based combat.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6384233) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game is action-packed and really captures the vibe of the anime so well in its battles and combat, delivering an authentic anime gaming experience in battle royale format.\r\nWhile the controls are generally responsive, I did notice that there's a learning curve, especially when playing with a keyboard and mouse. With multiple controls than usual for abilities, dodging, and items, it takes a bit of time to get used to the layout.\r\nThe free-to-play model is fair, and in-game purchases are not overly intrusive. The ability to earn most characters through gameplay is a plus, and the premium battle pass can be unlocked without spending real money.\r\nCurrently, the battle royale market is still saturated, so this will need some serious updates to survive. Unfortunately,  the game  having no crossplay doesn't help, despite the game being available on PC, Xbox, PS, and Switch, this means the playerbase is automatically splintered.\r\nWhile the initial impressions are positive, there's plenty of room for improvement. I found ultra chaotic nature of the battles overwhelming and annoying, and certain character abilities might need balancing. (stun-locks and huge AOEs). Also, I hope the fair F2P model is maintained, and crossplay support is added in the future.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6389164) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Warhammer 40,000: Darktide\r\n8.4\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nWarhammer 40K: Darktide has now been released on Xbox, accompanied by a plethora of updates with Patch #13 that transforms it into what feels like an entirely new game. Xbox players who are joining the fray later shouldn't feel left behind or delayed, for lack of a better word. In fact, you can say that its 10 months on PC was just the early access period, so yeah, thanks PC beta testers.\r\nWhen I reviewed Warhammer 40,000: Darktide last year, I already had fun with the game and touted it as a reasonable Vermintide attempt on the Warhammer 40,000 franchise. However, there were glaring issues during release, such as poor performance and a very repetitive gameplay loop that was only forgivable by its four-man co-op nature.\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nBefore we dive into the specifics of Patch #13, let's set the stage by introducing Warhammer 40K: Darktide for those who are new to the game. This title is set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, a dystopian future where humanity is locked in an unending war against alien species, heretics, and demonic forces. The game plunges you into the underbelly of this grim future, where you play as a member of an Inquisition strike team sent to investigate the mysteries and threats lurking beneath the hive city of Tertium.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nIn Darktide, you'll join forces with up to three friends or AI-controlled allies, forming a squad of relentless warriors. Your mission is to descend into the depths of the hive city, battling hordes of grotesque enemies, uncovering secrets, and unearthing the horrifying truth that awaits you. The atmosphere is oppressive, the enemies are nightmarish, and the stakes are as high as they come.\r\nDarktide is all about cooperative, first-person shooter action. Similar to titles like Left 4 Dead, Warhammer: Vermintide, or the much more hardcore co-op game GTFO. The game thrives on teamwork, requiring you and your squadmates to work together to survive the relentless onslaught of enemies. Each character class brings unique abilities and roles to the table, from the spellcasting Psyker to the heavy-hitting, gigantic Ogryn.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat is visceral and intense, with a wide variety of weapons to choose from, each with its own distinct feel and utility.  Darktide’s gameplay has an amazing dynamic between gunplay and melee combat. Both are executed splendidly, but the melee combat still shines. The gunplay did not completely depreciate the value of melee combat, it merely enhanced it.\r\nYou'll quickly realize that this isn't a game for the faint of heart. Darktide excels in immersing you in its dark and dangerous world, and every decision you make, every shot you fire, can mean the difference between life and death. The gameplay is unforgiving, but it's this challenge that makes the victories all the more satisfying.\r\n## 🛠️The Class Overhaul\r\nNow, the game wasn’t universally praised at launch, mainly due to its optimization and repetitive nature. However, Patch #13 brings about the much-anticipated \"Class Overhaul\", which brings more engaging content into the game. This update is a game-changer, not just for existing players but also as a first impression for newcomers.\r\nThe most significant change in Patch #13 is the replacement of the Feats system with Talent Trees. Each character class now has its Talent Tree, and as you level up, you earn Talent Points. You can allocate these points to unlock and enhance abilities and passives within your Talent Tree.\r\nEvery character begins with Baseline Abilities, including Blitz and Aura, which can be modified or upgraded through the Talent Tree system. This means that from the outset, you have a unique character, and as you progress, you can shape them to your liking. This level of customization adds depth and replayability to the game, as you experiment with different builds and strategies. Overall, the flexibility here is incredible and was never possible before, allowing you to actually tailor your character to your preferred playstyle.\r\n## 💾What about old builds?\r\nFatshark has ensured that the old builds created through the Feats system are still possible. They have integrated former Feats into the individual Talent Trees, allowing you to recreate those beloved playstyles while exploring the new possibilities the Talent Trees offer.\r\n## 📊Performance\r\nWell, compared to my experience around the launch, the performance has improved significantly running on my same setup of i7-8700k and RTX 3080. However, there are still minor stutters when looking around or loading new textures. The Xbox Series X version on the other hand offers both 60FPS performance and a 30FPS quality mode. The Series S version is locked to 30FPS only.\r\n## 🚧That and more\r\nPatch #13 isn't just about Talent Trees; it also introduces extensive balance changes. Characters and enemies have been adjusted to ensure a more engaging and challenging experience. Weapons have been fine-tuned based on community feedback, enhancing the overall combat feel. I previously complained about how guns are underwhelming and lack stopping power, it seems that that issue for me is gone now.\r\nBeyond gameplay changes, Patch #13 addresses hundreds of bugs and even adds new narrative flavors such as new cinematic cutscenes, ensuring a more enjoyable and immersive gameplay and narrative experience. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements, such as the revamped controller options section, make the game more accessible and user-friendly.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWhile Patch #13 is a monumental update, it's crucial to understand that Darktide's appeal extends beyond gameplay mechanics. During launch, the game already excelled in creating an atmosphere of relentless tension and dread. The Warhammer 40,000 universe is renowned for its dark and gritty aesthetic, and Darktide captures it perfectly. Now, combining that with almost a year's worth of refining the game mechanics makes it a must-try for anyone looking for an intense and rewarding co-op experience, EVEN if you have already played Darktide at launch and stopped.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6390263) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Strange Hill\r\n8.5\r\nAdventure\r\nAction\r\nPre-register\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nStrange Hill is a third-person platformer adventure that recently made its debut on Android and iOS, with a PC (Steam) release soon. This open-world game invites players to the peculiar town of Strange Hill, filled with interactive environments, intriguing quests, and a dash of thrill and mystery.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Charming Visuals\r\n- Fluid Controls\r\n- Plans for future content and updates## Cons\r\n- Intrusive and annoying ads\r\n- Very short runtime of over an hour\r\n## 📖Story and Art Style\r\nThe narrative is light-hearted and reminiscent of CGI cartoon films like \"Monster House\" or \"Hotel Transylvania.\" The artistic design embraces a vibrant, colorful aesthetic, where whimsical bunnies coexist with humans in a town that radiates charm.\r\nThe town of Strange Hill itself is a character in its own right, filled with distinctive creatures and mysteries waiting to be unraveled. By completing tasks for the town's inhabitants, you'll not only progress through the game but also delve deeper into the histories and destinies of its denizens. The addition of companions like Ben the robot and Howard the hopper adds depth to the narrative, providing a sense of whimsical companionship as you navigate this quirky and “Strange” world.\r\nThe central mystery of Strange Hill revolves around your Hello Neighbor, Dr. Wood, and his assistant Gloria. As you uncover their secrets, you'll find yourself embroiled in age-old conflicts among feuding clans and even traveling between worlds.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay and Performance\r\nIn terms of gameplay, Strange Hill draws inspiration from classic PS2 and PS3-era 3D platformer games. It combines elements of open-world exploration with puzzles and shooting mechanics. The controls are intuitive, and the game's light resource demands ensure a smooth experience.\r\nI found the gameplay and controls of the game very fluid. On my Snapdragon 888 phone, the game runs smoothly, without any slowdowns and heavy battery drain. Movement feels natural, allowing you to move and jump effortlessly. However, the combat mechanics may leave some players wanting more.\r\nWhile you can shoot enemies, there's a noticeable cooldown between shots, foes are only stunned temporarily, requiring a melee attack to defeat them permanently. This adds a layer of challenge reminiscent of classic platformer games, especially since your character has limited lives and can succumb to enemies in just one or two hits.\r\nFor those who enjoy a bit of stealth gameplay, Strange Hill offers moments of tension as you sneak around and hide from enemies, particularly when navigating Dr. Wood's enigmatic house. This aspect of the game feels very similar to \"Hello Neighbor,\".\r\nOne potential drawback of Strange Hill is its relatively short length. It can be completed in just over an hour, which might leave some players craving more content. However, the developers have promised regular updates and extensions, which could address this issue and provide a reason to return to the game in the future.\r\n## 💵Free to Play, Ad-Driven\r\nStrange Hill adopts a free-to-play model, making it accessible to a wide audience. However, it's worth noting that the game is peppered with ads, which can be mildly intrusive and annoying. There’s also in-app purchases available to boost your character's abilities or perhaps offer extra lives/revives. These purchases can facilitate your journey and introduce exciting elements, but the game doesn't pressure you to spend money. It's entirely possible to enjoy and finish Strange Hill as it is now without making any purchases, although some players may opt to enhance their experience with these microtransactions, so it’s a bit pay-to-win in a sense.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nStrange Hill is definitely a charming short-lived adventure thanks to its cartoon-inspired visuals, fluid controls, and moments of stealth gameplay. While the combat mechanics may leave some players wanting more depth, the game's short length and ad-driven model are forgivable considering its free-to-play nature, and it can only get better, as Strange Hill plans to evolve with regular updates and extensions.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6388739) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE\r\n9.0\r\nAction\r\nPvP\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nMY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE is a free-to-play Battle Royale game set in the world of the hit anime series. Players will have the chance to choose their favorite character, team up with others, and engage in thrilling battles where both heroes and villains alike collide in chaotic battle royale action. The game is available on PC, Xbox, PS, and Switch, but unfortunately, there is no crossplay.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Visually captivating\r\n- Captures the feel of the anime in its presentation\r\n- Matches are quick and mini-sized (only 24 players and a small map)\r\n- Responsive Controls\r\n- Free-to-play experience/progression is forgiving but not easy## Cons\r\n- Overly chaotic gameplay\r\n- Imbalanced combat\r\n- Default bindings aren’t good, at least on keyboard and mouse\r\n- No crossplay, playerbase is instantly divided into the different platforms\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nMY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE excels in its visual and audio presentation. The game captures the essence of the anime, featuring vibrant and action-packed battles. The character abilities are executed with style, and the dubbing adds an authentic anime feel. It also features some limited form of environmental destruction elements that further enhance the overall immersion and excitement. You can punch through walls, fences, and floors, just like how Anime characters would.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nAt its core, MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE is a Battle Royale game but the implementation is a bit light. Instead of the traditional 100-player setup on a massive map, this game opts for a mini-sized Battle Royale, accommodating 24 players organized into 8 teams of 3 players each. Players select their starting location before the match begins, and then the playing field gradually shrinks over time. Across the map, they can loot around to get consumable items that heal HP or Armor, or get ability upgrades and passives that will help them gain the upper hand during combat.\r\nThe Battle Royale aspect isn't as pronounced as in other games of the genre. The map is relatively small, and encounters with opponents may be sparse in the early stages of a match. Additionally, the shrinking circle is forgiving for like 90% of matches, resulting in less pressure on players to stay within the safe zone.\r\nMY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE incorporates Quirks, the unique superpowers possessed by characters in the anime series. Players choose their favorite characters from a diverse roster, each falling into one of five archetypes: Strike, Assault, Rapid, Technical, and Support. These characters not only look and sound authentic but also bring their unique Quirks into battle.\r\nThe game encourages teamwork and communication as players form teams of three to take on other squads. Synergizing Quirks with your teammates becomes essential to secure victory in this 24-player Battle Royale. This teamwork aspect coincidentally aligns well with the anime's themes. Of course, this game is best played with friends instead of randoms.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe gameplay experience benefits from fluid animations and highly responsive controls. However, there is a learning curve, particularly when playing with a keyboard and mouse. The game's numerous controls for jumping, dodging, using abilities, melee attacks, and items can be overwhelming at first with all the weird bindings in place. The default keybind choices might not suit everyone, especially for a game with such chaotic battles.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat is visually pleasing, and is multilayered into different types of attacks, depending on the character used. Three types of abilities are available to the player, along with a basic melee attack. As with other BR games, the player can be downed and subsequently KO’d if not revived in time. KO’d players can still be brought back to the game though, if your teammates get their hands on a revive card.\r\nWhile the combat visuals are mighty impressive, the gameplay can sometimes feel imbalanced. Stun-locking and abilities that send characters flying without a chance to react can lead to frustrating moments. The Battle Royale format amplifies this chaos tenfold, turning matches into free-for-alls with a flurry of abilities and area-of-effect attacks.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nMY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE adopts a free-to-play model with live service elements. Players can log in daily for bonuses and enjoy the game without feeling pressured to spend money. While not overly intrusive, the presence of in-game self-promotion ads can be a minor annoyance for some players.\r\nUnlocking characters and customization options can be achieved through experience gain and completing missions. Notably, the game provides three free tickets to access any character every few hours, making it possible to access the majority of characters through gameplay. Only a few characters are locked behind the gacha system, while the rest are obtained through in-game currency or progression. Cosmetics and additional character customization options round out the rest of the available content.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nMY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE combines the popular Battle Royale format with the beloved anime series. It offers a unique and action-packed gaming experience that is sure to resonate with fans of the franchise. The game's visual and audio presentation captures the essence of the anime, immersing players in My Hero Academia’s world. However, the combat, while visually pleasing, might need some tweaking to be more enjoyable overall. The progression seems fine as it is, offering a balanced free-to-play/premium experience. Let’s hope it won’t change in the future and become more grindy, and crossplay support is added in the future.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6389197) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This is similar to system seen in RPG games such as Diablo.\r\nBaseline Abilities and Customization:\r\nEvery character begins with Baseline Abilities, including Blitz and Aura, which can be modified or upgraded through the Talent Tree system. This means that from the outset, you have a unique character, and as you progress, you can shape them to your liking. This level of customization adds depth and replayability to the game, as you experiment with different builds and strategies. Overall, the flexibility here is incredible and was never possible before, allowing you to actually tailor your character to your preferred playstyle.\r\nImproved Performance\r\nWell, compared to my experience around the launch which was awful, the performance has improved significantly running on my same setup of i7-8700k and RTX 3080. However, there are still minor stutters when looking around or loading new textures. The Xbox Series X version on the other hand offers both 60FPS performance and a 30FPS quality mode. The Series S version is locked to 30FPS only.\r\nOther changes:\r\nPatch #13 also introduces extensive balance changes. Characters and enemies have been adjusted to ensure a more engaging and challenging experience. Weapons have been fine-tuned based on community feedback, enhancing the overall combat feel.\r\nBeyond gameplay changes, Patch #13 addresses hundreds of bugs and even adds new narrative flavors such as new cinematic cutscenes, ensuring a more enjoyable and immersive gameplay and narrative experience. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements, such as the revamped controller options section, make the game more accessible and user-friendly.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6390262) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The central mystery of Strange Hill revolves around your enigmatic neighbor, Dr. Wood, and his assistant Gloria. As you uncover their secrets, you'll find yourself embroiled in age-old conflicts among feuding clans and even traveling between worlds.\r\nThe gameplay primarily consists of a third-person platformer, with elements of stealth and shooter gameplay, although the these aspects are only lightly explored. You'll explore the town itself, take on different quests, including the main story.\r\nWhile the game is free to play, it does offer in-app purchases for items and skills, but the game doesn't pressure you to spend money excessively. It's entirely possible to finish Strange Hill without making any purchases, although the game is also filled with ads which can be quite annoying.\r\nWith its endearing characters, lighthearted short-lived narrative, and promise of ongoing updates, Strange Hill offers a charming experience that currently --- sits at about over an hour for the main campaign. It's pretty short, so might leave some players craving more content. However, the developers have promised regular updates and extensions, which could address this issue and provide a reason to return to the game in the future.\r\nCurrently, Strange Hill has recently made its debut on Android and iOS, with a PC (Steam) release coming soon.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6388738) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Enshrouded\r\n9.8\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nTest\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nEnshrouded is an exciting upcoming game that seamlessly blends survival, crafting, and action RPG combat set in a vast, voxel-based continent, this open-world adventure offers players the freedom to build, craft, and fight.\r\nWhile exact release dates are still under wraps, Enshrouded promises to be a multi-platform release with a release on PC and on Xbox and PS5 later down the line. The game has a limited demo on Steam is a fantastic opportunity for players to get a taste of its potential. The 8 hour time-limited demo allows you to play through the initial quests, helping players become familiar with the game.\r\n## 📖Premise / Story\r\nIn Enshrouded, players assume the role of the Flameborn, the last glimmers of hope for a dying race. This co-op survival adventure begins with nothing but your determination to survive and explore the wilds. Scavenging through the remnants of a fallen kingdom is a necessity for survival, and you must fend off ravenous beasts and monsters, both natural and unnatural. As you journey through diverse landscapes, including forests, caves, and dungeons, you'll uncover hidden knowledge and treasure. Your ultimate goal: to gather the strength needed to confront the horrors lurking within the Shroud, the land-devouring “mist”, and causes these lands to be “Enshrouded”.\r\n## 🎨Visuals\r\nDespite looking like a typical cut and dried modern Unreal Engine game, Enshrouded still presents players with a visually stunning world that showcases meticulous attention to detail. The lighting effects are enchanting, the stylized character models intricately designed, and the game world is beautifully crafted. From lush, green forests to dark and desolate enshrouded regions, even the underground lava-filled caverns are brought to life in vivid detail.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay in Enshrouded combines elements from beloved titles like Valheim and Breath of the Wild, two games that are great in their own right and is a good choice for inspiration. Survival crafting, with elements of building, and action RPG goodness.\r\nAs a survival crafting game, Enshrouded includes typical features such as a resource gathering and crafting system, a tiered building system, NPCs like blacksmiths, and tools like workbenches to aid in your building and crafting endeavors.\r\nPlayers have the freedom to construct their bases within the game world, and Enshrouded boasts a finely detailed construction system that offers more granularity than many other titles in the genre. This means you can place tiny individual 1 foot blocks instead of the usual large 1 meter walls or blocks seen in other survival crafting games. However, it's worth noting that the building placement system still requires some refinement, as it can be challenging to seamlessly and quickly snap building blocks together.\r\nThe combat system draws inspiration from Dark Souls and also Breath of the Wild, emphasizing the importance of timing, dodging, and parrying. It's a refreshing departure from the clunky norm, offering a satisfying and solid combat experience where hits feel weighty, and animations are both swift and responsive.\r\nPlayers can choose their combat style, whether it's melee, ranged, or magic, and seamlessly switch between them using the hotbar. Beyond combat, Enshrouded introduces various platforming adventure elements, including gliding, grappling hooks, and wall climbing. These are complemented by puzzles, traps, and mechanisms found in ancient vaults and caverns, further adding minor flavors to the gameplay and character maneuverability.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nAs you explore the world of Enshrouded and battle its formidable foes, you'll accumulate experience points and skill points. These can be invested to enhance your character's abilities in an action RPG-like fashion. Skills like reduced weapon degradation, increased endurance in enshrouded regions, and the ability to execute sneak attacks are some examples to provide ample customization options, allowing players to tailor their characters to their preferred playstyle.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, Enshrouded performed satisfactory during the demo on my PC (i7-8700k, 32GB RAM, RTX 3080). I did not experience any game-breaking bugs and crashes throughout the entire demo experience. In fact, dare I say it even appears to be ready for Early Access, offering a high level of quality.\r\nEnshrouded also features solid controller support even at this stage, enhancing accessibility for players who prefer that input method. However, there's room for refinement, particularly in terms of controls, which may take some getting used to, and there are many quality of life changes the game can benefit with, such as auto-run, a separate button for sprint and crouching.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe demo only offers a taste of the game's potential. However, for what was presented to me, Enshrouded is shaping up to be a great surviving crafting ARPG. That is if they can maintain this level of quality throughout the entirety of the experience, including the actual co-op play and balance, endgame content, and especially if they give players the tools to craft their own experiences, such as allowing for custom world settings or the hosting of private servers. While some minor issues exist, these experiences during the demo are overshadowed by Enshrouded’s overall quality and potential for refinement.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6407543) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The demo allows you to play through the initial quests, helping players become familiar with the game and see what it's like.\r\nWell, what is it like?\r\nThe gameplay feels like a mashup between Valheim and Breath of the Wild, both of which are great games. Survival Crafting and Building with a touch of solidly made ARPG-style combat with parries, dodging, and satisfying attacks.\r\nWhile it looks like a typical modern unreal engine game, The graphics still looks awesome with great lighting effects, detailed models, and a beautifully crafted world with varied biomes; from lush green forests, dark desolated enshrouded regions, to even underground lava filled caverns. The titular Enshrouded regions are what the game is all about, caused by the land-devouring “mist” called the Shroud.\r\nThe game also features various “platforming” features such as gliding, grappling hooks, wall climbing, as well as puzzles, traps, and mechanisms when stumbling upon ancient vaults and caverns to progress into. Definitely feels more like an adventure RPG game like Breath of the Wild instead of a survival crafting game during these moments.\r\nI was able to complete the demo's quest content for about two hours, and I can say this game has potential. The performance is already good, and it even has controller support already baked in. Overall, it is even solid enough for me that i think it can already be released as an Early Access game today.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6407368) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "title": "A promising upcoming gacha RPG in need of more polish | Demo Review - ASTRA: Knights of Veda",
    "description": "ASTRA: Knights of Veda 7.8 Action RPG Get",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "7.8\r\nAction\r\nRPG\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet in the bleak world of Planis, ravaged by the oppressive reign of grotesque King Magnus, ASTRA presents a dark and gripping narrative. The story takes a truly sinister turn reminiscent of the depths of despair that reminded me of Berserk.\r\nThe emergence of a malevolent tree, leading to horrifying undead consequences for its victims, sets the stage for a desperate struggle. The goddess Veda intervenes, choosing a champion, one of the Knights of Veda, to combat the looming curse and bring hope back to the world. This premise sets the tone for a narrative that promises to be both haunting and captivating.\r\nThe central theme of ASTRA revolves around the quest to find and collect all 12 pieces of Veda, along with her lost and corrupted books, adding layers of depth to the storyline.\r\n## 🎨Art and Graphics\r\nNevertheless, the art is undeniably impressive. It closely resembles the style of games like Dragon’s Crown and Dragon Blaze, making it a distinctive visually pleasing experience despite its simplicity. Additionally, the English voice acting holds up well. It feels like this game has high production values, particularly evident in some of the animated cutscenes.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay in ASTRA is reminiscent of titles like Dragon’s Crown, Dragon Blaze, and, more recently, the sleeper hit Astlibra Revision. However, unlike Astlibra Revision, which leans towards a pure 2D platformer, ASTRA presents itself in a 2.5D beat-'em-up and hack-and-slash style.\r\nThe game begins at a slow pace, taking over an hour to complete the tutorial level and enter the gacha mechanics and adventure mode. While the storyline is captivating, the cutscenes are overly drawn out and there is an excessive amount of dialogue, leading to pacing issues. Fortunately, the cutscenes can be autoplayed and even sped to 2X, in which the implementation works pretty well and improves the pacing a little bit. Still, you can opt to completely skip the cutscenes if you only care about the actual gameplay\r\nThe player character can also roam around the village to talk with characters and progress the story, although you can also opt to skip these “free roam” segments and portal straight to the next objective, which is neat for those who’d want to skip these segments. You can also partake in other side missions or activities such as cooking.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nASTRA allows players to control multiple characters, one at a time with seamless switching between them, reminiscent of titles like Genshin Impact or Aether Gazer. Each Knight possesses unique skills and abilities, classified into melee, ranged, and magic categories. The gacha element comes into play when collecting these diverse Knights.\r\nHowever, the combat experience leaves much to be desired.  ASTRA's combat feels unresponsive, inaccurate, and janky, lacking the fluidity of titles like the aforementioned Dragon's Crown. It's clear that the game draws inspiration from the latter but falls short in terms of smoothness.\r\nAction is introduced at a sluggish pace, with long sequences of story in between short combat segments, leading to a somewhat disjointed experience. The camera's unnaturally close zoom significantly limits visibility, potentially affecting the player's ability to react to enemies promptly. As a gacha game, ASTRA incorporates familiar features such as autoplay, an adventure mode for the main story, an idle game mode called \"Nightmare\", premium currency, and a stamina/energy system called “Shoes” to limit adventure mode play, although I was overflowing with “shoes” for my first few hours of play. Elements of Genshin Impact are evident and the game clearly takes pages from Genshin, particularly in gacha mechanics and UI design, though ASTRA lacks transparency in pull rates.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nAn unfortunate thing, but my experience with ASTRA was severely hampered by it subpar performance. Despite displaying 60fps, the game often feels closer to 30fps or even lower due to its sluggish animations and combat, which is surprising considering its 2.5D nature. The game supports both keyboard and mouse controls, as well as partial controller support where some segments still requires the mouse/touch for navigation. Handling and responsiveness issues, especially during combat, hinder the overall experience for both keyboard and gamepad schemes.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6409697) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The game starts slowly, requiring over an hour to complete the tutorial level and delve into gacha mechanics and the adventure mode. While the storyline is compelling with its dark and unsettling themes, the cutscenes tend to be overly lengthy, leading to pacing issues and excessive dialogue. Fortunately, you can fast forward through them while still comfortably grasping the story's essence, or you can outright skip the cutscenes if you prefer.\r\nExcept for the 2.5D style hack and slash combat, in terms of gameplay and gacha mechanics, the rest of the game will feel right at home for Genshin Impact players. ASTRA allows players to control multiple characters one at a time, with seamless switching between them. Each Knight, obtained via the gacha mechanic, possesses unique skills and abilities, categorized into melee, ranged, and magic.\r\nThe demo allowed players to explore the adventure mode for progression the story, the separate \"nightmare\" mode for idle gameplay, and the village where you can talk with NPCs and roam around in. You can also partake in other side missions or activities such as cooking.\r\nOverall, the demo didn't quite impress me in terms of gameplay, and the game still needs a lot of work in terms of combat fluidity and general quality of life improvements, such as better camera work and improved performance. However, the story -- while flawed in its pacing -- is intriguing enough to maintain my interest throughout the demo.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6409646) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Devil May Cry: Peak of CombatGlobal 7.8 Action Hack And Slash Get",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "Devil May Cry: Peak of CombatGlobal\r\n7.8\r\nAction\r\nHack And Slash\r\nGet\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat, the long-awaited mobile entry in the iconic Devil May Cry franchise, Promises to bring the same hack-and-slash mayhem to mobile devices but with a somewhat polarizing gacha twist. The game has been through various testing phases and now we are on a final stretch with a final closed beta test.\r\n## 📖Story and Narrative Continuity\r\nThe game occupies a unique narrative space. Similar to the largely forgotten DmC: Devil May Cry, it exists within its own continuity while revisiting familiar grounds. Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat offers a reimagining of DMC 3, supplemented with elements borrowed from various mainline games, even those set after DMC 3. This narrative approach provides fans with both a sense of nostalgia and novelty. The game features major mainline characters—Dante, Vergil, Nero, V, and Lady—now united, equipped with seamless character switching and integrated combo potential. Basically, just forget about the story of the other mainline games and just treat this as its own little pocket of alternate reality.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Atmosphere\r\nWhile the visuals may not push the boundaries of mobile gaming, they certainly land in a decent spot, surpassing the standards set by DMC 3 and aligning with the quality of DMC 4. The atmosphere and feel of the series have been effectively captured, complete with a fitting soundtrack and impactful sound effects, especially for the combos. Character models have adequate detail, and the environments are well-designed, contributing to the game's immersive quality. Even on smaller screens, the visuals maintain fidelity.\r\n## ⚔️Gameplay: Staying True to Its Roots?\r\nWhen I previewed the game back a few months ago, I touted it as a game that stays true to its roots gameplay wise. Well, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat continues to uphold the core hack-and-slash gameplay style that the series is renowned for. It manages to maintain the essence of the franchise, offering players an opportunity to indulge in the exhilarating combat experience on their mobile devices. The streamlined controls, tailored for mobile, ensure that the transition from consoles to phones is relatively smooth. Players will appreciate the simplicity and accessibility of these controls, which enable precise and responsive movements.\r\nTaking a page from its gacha contemporaries, the game also allows players to seamlessly switch between three characters during combat (e.g. Dante, Nero, and Lady) This mechanic, unchanged from the early preview that I’ve played, encourages creativity and strategy in battles, and enhances the combo system and makes it more dynamic, compensating for the streamlined and simplified touch controlled combat. Not present from my earlier test, there is also now a reaction-based counter system that have been introduced which I haven’t noticed before, further enhancing the depth and adding more sense of skill to the combat. However, it's not without its flaws, as targeting can be problematic, especially when aiming at airborne units, and controlling the camera during combat is very challenging. It's definitely not the 'Peak of Combat' as far as the Devil May Cry series is concerned.\r\nInterestingly, despite being on a platform known for idle game mechanics, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat does not incorporate an Automatic Mode.  that was featured in the mainline series to make it accessible for more people. This omission feels like a missed opportunity, especially given the game's farming-oriented progression system.\r\n## 🎰Gacha Grindfest\r\nInfused within its gameplay is a live service element and a gacha system that is integrated into the progression system. Not everyone will appreciate this change, and, in my opinion, this simple transition fundamentally alters the entire paradigm of the game, and, in my view, not for the better\r\nPlayers will now encounter features familiar to gacha players, such as login bonuses, weekly events, game modes for grinding resources, premium currency bought with real money, and a stamina system represented as \"pizzas,\" which are required to continue playing the main campaign, and it is not very generous. First hour in and I was already running out of pizzas to play.\r\nI’ve noticed that significant grinding is need required to make progress in the game even as early as the first chapter. This entails acquiring experience points by completing various missions, which also yield materials for enhancing weapons, characters, and statistics. This grind-heavy progression system has a direct impact on combat, as enemies become excessively challenging unless players invest considerable time in grinding or resort to spending real money. The difficulty spikes can be frustrating, potentially deterring players from fully enjoying the combat experience.\r\n## 🚧Technical Performance\r\nCompared to my earlier test a few months ago, the game as it is now has seen optimization improvements, running much more smoothly on my device with a Snapdragon 888 chipset. These optimizations allowed me to enjoy the game at maximum graphics settings while targeting a stable 60fps, a substantial improvement from the early preview.\r\nThe user interface (UI) remains problematic, navigating the UI, there’s too many clicks need to perform even the simplest of tasks. Whether it's upgrading characters, weapons, ranking up, or even changing weapons and cards, the UI's inefficiency hampered my overall gameplay experience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat is a commendable effort to translate the core elements of the Devil May Cry franchise into the mobile gaming sphere. It captures the essence of the series, both in terms of art and gameplay. The seamless character switching, engaging combat, and mid DMC-looking graphics contribute to an enjoyable gameplay experience. However, the grind-heavy progression centered on its gacha mechanics is what hurts this game the most, especially for DMC fans transitioning from the mainline games to this title. It doesn’t hurt to try since it’s going to be free to play, but don’t expect a smooth skill-based progression that we are used to from the mainline games.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6411911) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Drawing inevitable comparisons to Hades, it delivers a fast-paced gaming experience that's both addictively entertaining and uniquely its own.\r\nWarm Snow distinguishes itself with agile, fluid, and satisfying combat. The flashy and visceral visual effects are amazing and fits perfectly with the game's action-packed tone. Players can experiment and swap found items called relics between four different slots, altering their function. Clear rooms, combat different types of enemies, and kill the boss to end the chapter.

This abundance of options ensures that each playthrough feels distinct and exciting, and keeps on giving players options as they go deeper in the chapters.\r\nThe game offers an experience that is both similar to and distinct from Hades, making it a compelling choice for those who crave high-speed swordplay and enjoy experimenting with unique character builds.

    "body": "Warm Snow\r\n8.9\r\nRoguelite\r\nStory Rich\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nWarm Snow is an exhilarating take on the action roguelike genre that draws comparisons to Hades due to its fast-paced combat and diverse build options. The game was recently made available on Android and iOS after a successful release on Steam last year, receiving critical acclaim.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fun, Flashy, and Simple Combat Mechanics\r\n- Impressive Chinese-Inspired Art and Visuals\r\n- Diverse Character Builds and Experimentation\r\n- Deep and Rewarding Progression\r\n- High Replayability\r\n## Cons\r\n- Severe performance issues on mobile devices, including frame rate drops and font readability problems\r\n- Awkward English translations.\r\n## 📖Story\r\nThe narrative in Warm Snow takes a backseat to its rogue-lite structure. It is intricately woven into the levels and boss encounters, which evolve with each repeated run. While the storyline may not be as narratively deep as some other titles, it plays an essential role in the repetitive nature that defines the roguelike genre. Players should expect to uncover more about the game's lore and world even with repeating runs.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nWarm Snow draws inspiration from Chinese art, mythology, and culture, seamlessly blending elements of darkness and the undead. If you have a penchant for titles like Onimusha, Nioh, or Sekiro (even though they ARE japanese), you'll find familiar asian themes and aesthetics here. The game's art style and soundtrack are carefully crafted to immerse players in a world that feels authentic and atmospheric. This distinct artistic approach adds a layer of immersion and appeal despite the 2D style cartoonish graphics. The flashy and visceral visual effects are amazing and fits perfectly with the game's action-packed tone. The game features voice acting in Chinese with occasionally awkward English translations.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nWhere Warm Snow truly exceedingly shines is in its gameplay. The game delivers fast, fluid, and immensely satisfying combat. Players can dodge, attack, and use abilities. On the mobile version, you also have the option to “tether” commands together, such as binding dodge and attack together, essentially serving as an in-game macro so that you’ll dodge and attack at the same time whenever these buttons are pressed. This is a cool feature that only makes the game more fun and agile feeling.\r\nDrawing parallels to Hades is inevitable, yet Warm Snow offers its own distinct approach. Clear rooms, combat different types of enemies, and kill the boss to end the chapter. Next chapter, rinse and repeat. If you die, back from the start.\r\nThrough runs, you’ll be given options what path and loot to take, either currencies, relics, weapons, stat boosts, and more. As for the relics, these are items that literally changes your character's powers, and you can either equip it with one of four slots; Core, Power, Agility, and Skill, thereby changing their functions depending on the slot type. You can swap these relics with these slots anytime therefore providing extreme customizability in builds as you discover more relics. This aspect minimizes the potential frustration of relying on luck and random chance.\r\nThe game's depth extends further with a wide array of relics, swords, and numerous combat styles by way of the statues that are unlocked after each boss defeated. There are also various NPCs to be found across the levels that can grant you further rewards and augmentations. This abundance of options ensures that each playthrough feels distinct and exciting, and keeps on giving players options as they go deeper in the chapters.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nDespite having the ability to swap out relics to any of the four slots, the game still has a lot of reliance on luck and chance, at least in the first few hours of play. The relics and weapons you find are more randomized and chaotic in nature, as such, you’d almost never get your desired build or synergies during your first few hours of play. However, as you accumulate more in-game currency, you gain the ability to seal relics, effectively \"banning\" unwanted items and increasing the likelihood of others appearing. The longer you play, the more control you have over character development and experimentation, which proves rewarding for players, even in the face of a very unforgiving roguelike progression system that resets your progress to the beginning upon death.\r\nThe progression system is truly impressive, and there's an abundance of room for experimentation and combos, making each run a unique and captivating journey.\r\nHaving said that, the game is very grindy, even more so than Hades.\r\nThe rogue-lite progression system in \"Warm Snow\" is robust and engaging. Red Souls, a currency earned through defeating bosses during runs, are invested in passive skill trees. These offer substantial enhancements to the player's abilities. The game encourages continued exploration and lore discovery as part of meta-progression. This element provides a sense of achievement and a strong motivation for players to return to the game for more runs and deeper exploration.\r\nWarm Snow also introduces three passive skill trees, each providing various passive bonuses that enhance gameplay. The meta-progression in the game is a key element, incentivizing players to explore, discover lore, and continue unlocking content.\r\n## 📊Performance\r\nWhile Warm Snow excels in the gameplay department, it faces a significant drawback in the form of performance on mobile devices. Playing on the lowest setting is the minimum requirement to achieve a stable 60fps, but this can lead to a pixelated mess in addition to the already small fontsizes.\r\nEven with this, on my Snapdragon 888 phone, I've experienced severe FPS drops, especially when rapidly pressing the attack or dodge buttons. Interestingly, when I hold these buttons down instead to continuously attacking or dodging, the game seems to like prefer this technique and perform significantly better. Still, holding the buttons down isn't always a viable tactic, particularly against certain enemies and bosses. Overall, it definitely needs some more work with the optimization to be truly enjoyable from start to finish,\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWarm Snow not only serves as a fantastic stopgap for eager fans awaiting for Hades 2, but also establishes itself as a distinct and engaging roguelite in its own right. Despite the performance issues on mobile, I definitely love this game and would even repurchase it for PC/Steam Deck so I’ll basically have a better performing experience, for now. It’s one of the best rogue-lite games I’ve played, but on mobile, performance issues hamper the overall experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6414127) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It pits players of up to 8 vs 8 across various Arenas (currently four as of the Open Beta Test). The game is still in heavy development but an Open Beta Test is currently underway for everyone to try.\r\nAs for writing, the game features 10 characters and 20 weapons to unlock, collect, and upgrade, along with gear like armors, weapon attachments, and masks. Of course this is facilitated by a live service style of progression, where we have in-game stores, premium currencies, loot boxes, and battle passes.\r\nTechnically, I found the game to be very stable.

FPS wise, it seems to support up to 120fps, judging from the graphics settings, but the graphics settings are still locked and cannot be changed as of this beta test.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6424627) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Forza Motorsport\r\n8.6\r\nRacing\r\nSimulation\r\nForza Motorsport is the thirteenth installment in the renowned Forza racing video game series. It is a soft reboot of sorts with high expectations and a storied history to uphold, this racing simulation game has faced the challenge of redefining the series for a new generation.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Realistic handling and an immersive driving experience\r\n- Extensive car roster with over 500 vehicles.\r\n- Great gamepad support with the best use of Xbox controller’s haptics that I’ve seen\r\n- A middle ground between arcade and realism, fine tune it to your liking\r\n- Accessibility options for various difficulty settings## Cons\r\n-The car upgrade system tends to feel grindy\r\n-Suboptimal optimization and performance on PC\r\n-Microtransactions/DLCs/Extra Content at launch, on top of a full priced AAA game\r\n-Feels like an Early Access game\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nForza Motorsport, developed by Turn 10 Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios, was released on October 10, 2023. Unlike its predecessors, it ditches the numerical sequencing, opting for a fresh approach to the series. The game was launched recently on PC and Xbox. It doesn't focus on an open-world arcade gameplay like its sibling Forza Horizon; instead, it immerses players in the world of motorsport, where the cars, tracks, and competition are the stars. It emphasizes the thrill of racing and the journey to become a top-tier racer.\r\n## 📺 Graphics and Presentation\r\nThe visual quality of Forza Motorsport is a decent leap forward in terms of graphics compared to previous titles. It’s not exactly groundbreaking as compared with other jumps, but I still find the game's visual quality particularly striking, especially the stunning ray tracing and particle effects. The reflections and lighting, especially when experienced with a high-end setup, contribute to an overall visually captivating racing experience.\r\nMoreover, the diverse selection of tracks, which includes classic favorites and exciting new additions, creates an engaging racing environment. The roster of over 500 cars are insanely detailed, and this is easily on par with the best looking racing sims out there like Gran Turismo 7 or Project Cars 2. Although I confidently wouldn’t say it is THE best looking race sim.\r\n## 🏎Gameplay\r\nForza Motorsport is basically a racing sim that tries to find a middle ground between arcade and realism, and you can even fine tune the gameplay to your liking. Making it more arcadey can be immediately satisfying and entertaining, but learning how to face the difficulties in properly handling the more realistic settings can be a more rewarding experience. The game's handling and driving physics are simply amazing, which I find significantly more nuanced and satisfying compared to its predecessors. For someone who enjoys racing, it provides a solid and enjoyable driving experience.\r\nIn addition to the tuning of the gameplay, the game's accessibility is another highlight. It caters to both newcomers and veterans, offering a wide range of difficulty settings and assist modes. This ensures that everyone from the casual player to the hardcore racing enthusiast can find a suitable challenge. I'm personally right in the middle, so I preferred the moderate settings.\r\nI haven’t really invested much into the online multiplayer experience since I'm more of a singleplayer / career type, but the multiplayer mode offers both a regular mode where you race with other players at events scheduled in real-world times, and a more asynchronous Rivals mode, featuring the time trial leaderboards, where players can attempt to match the performance of top drivers.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nForza Motorsport's progression system is where the game's weaknesses seem most evident. It shines in the context of the career mode, providing an engaging sense of progression that handholds the player into a guided journey. Starting with a basic vehicle and evolving it through a series of races can be immensely satisfying.\r\nHowever, not all is smooth on the racetrack. The car leveling system has come under fire for its grindy nature. Progressing through this system can feel like a laborious and unrewarding task. I would even like it to the grind often seen in free-to-play mobile games — and rightfully so, as it already comes with many micro-transactions baked in — which is simply downright a disrespect to those who have purchased the game just to find out many of the content is locked and can be accessed either by grinding or spending more money.\r\nI find it slow and cumbersome, requiring hours of investment to unlock meaningful upgrades for my cars, which can be a turn-off for players seeking a more rewarding experience. Some have also noted that the order of unlocks can result in early levels offering little more than raw power for muscle cars, neglecting handling upgrades, which may leave some players with underutilized vehicles.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI've experienced issues with optimization on PC on my i7-8700k 32GB RTX 3080 PC, I had to turn down many settings that I usually leave on in other games to achieve an enjoyable fluid performance. Even then, I’ve had many frame rate drops especially when the game changes scenes or camera angles. However for the entirety of the race, it’s at least stable, even though the FPS performance is underwhelming. It's disheartening for those with mid-range hardware, as it seems the full benefits of ray tracing are primarily reserved for top-tier PC configurations. Performance wise, it seems that the best-in-class smooth and stable performance is currently the Xbox Series X version.\r\nEven then, the visuals are inconsistent and have their fair share of issues. Players may encounter stuttering, broken LODs, and occasional weirdness in car models. Despite its visual improvements, it doesn't consistently offer the jump in fidelity one might expect.\r\nOverall, it feels like a game released too early and would have benefited from more time in the oven, or perhaps from an Early Access release. Gamepad support is good though. Finally, the haptics in my Xbox controller are being used properly once again.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nForza Motorsport offers a genuinely immersive driving experience that’s probably the best-in-class right now mechanically, but it isn't without its very rough edges. The car leveling system, progression, and subpar optimization on PC leave some players wanting more. If you're willing to power through the grind and ignore the technical hiccups, it’s still a rewarding driving experience. However, if you seek a polished, flawless racing game made to be enjoyed from day one, it might be advisable to wait for patches and overhauls to address the current issues.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6421746) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It emphasizes the thrill of racing and the journey to become a top-tier racer.\r\nForza Motorsport is at its core an exhilarating driving simulator, offering an engaging wheels experience that I would even say as the best in the franchise's history. The gamepad handling is top-notch, providing consistent and realistic control. Its adjustable and tunable difficulty caters to a broad audience, from novices looking for fun casual to seasoned SIM racers.\r\nThe car progression system, especially in the career mode, is engaging, starting with stock cars and allowing players to evolve them into competitive vehicles over time. However, outside of the career mode, the progression system is sluggish and requires significant grind.\r\nThe game's graphics are a mixed bag. On one hand, Forza Motorsport shines with its stunning particle effects and detailed tracks, breathing life into the racing environment.

    "body": "Polygun Arena: Online Shooter\r\n7.6\r\nAction\r\nShooter\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nPolygon Arena: Online Shooter is a fast-paced casual mobile shooter. This team-based deathmatch FPS is all about shootouts with opponents in thrilling battles across a four bite-sized maps: Bank Heist, The Garden, Parking Lot, and Farm House. Featuring a cast of ten characters, each armed with a unique passive and active ability. The game is currently in an Open Beta Test for Android as of writing with many new features added.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nPolygon Arena features a low polygonal art style. The game's visual design is a refreshing departure from the hyper-realistic graphics that have become the norm in the shooter genre. Polygon Arena's visuals are sleek, minimalistic, and crisp. Every aspect of the environment, from the maps to the character models, feels inspired by either Minecraft or Roblox. The minimalist design allows for excellent visibility, crucial in a fast-paced shooter where split-second decisions matter.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game features 10 characters and 20 weapons to unlock, collect, and upgrade, along with gear like armors, weapon attachments, and masks. You can equip more than just two weapons during matches.  Each character have their own ability, toxic grenades, turrets, or even COD-esque airstrikes.\r\nThe core mechanics are easy to pick up and the gunplay is enjoyable, straightforward, and designed for casual play with room for some competitiveness. Whether hipfiring or aiming down sights, guns fire automatically, eliminating the need for a dedicated fire button unless you turn off the Auto-fire option. However, the aim/fire assist feels a bit too strong and overpowered.\r\nPlayers can also throw frag and smoke grenades and activate a special ability once the meter is filled. It offers a standard COD-like FPS action but with a more casual and accessible feel. Almost anyone can jump in and play this game easily. However, for those accustomed to games with deep mechanics and a high skill ceiling, it may feel lacking.\r\nMatches are designed to be quick, lasting only around two minutes, making it ideal for both quick on-the-go sessions and low-stress competitive gaming.\r\n## 🚧Some new beta test features\r\nNew to this beta test is the League system, where you can rank up by playing more matches, starting from League 1 up to League 6 for now. Progressing through your league will also earn you additional currency and loot. You can also invite your friends and create public and private rooms with each other.\r\n## 💵Free-to-play or Premium?\r\nThe game is likely designed to become a free-to-play game, as the groundwork for microtransactions is already in place, with an in-game store, premium currency, loot boxes, and passes for acquiring characters and weapon cards for unlocks and upgrades.\r\n## 📊Open Beta Performance\r\nTechnically, I found the game to be very stable. It ran smoothly without any crashes on my Snapdragon 888 device. As expected, I noticed that I was playing with bots and in offline mode during the first few matches of my playthrough. Even when I turned off my Wi-Fi, the game and the players in my match continued to fight until I got disconnected when the match ended. Settings wise, there is currently no way to adjust your touch control placement, which is a highly requested feature for mobile games. FPS wise, it seems to support up to 120fps, judging from the graphics settings, but the graphics settings are still locked and cannot be changed as of this beta test.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nSimple controls and already a fun and familiar style of gunplay, If you're a fan of shooters or just looking for an casual and simple shooter on mobile, Polygon Arena: Online Shooter is one of the games that you should look out for, or even try right now while the beta test is opening. It’s clearly in its early stages, but it’s looking good so far.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6424664) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Assassin's Creed Mirage\r\n8.4\r\nAction\r\nAssassin\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nAssassin's Creed Mirage takes players on a journey to 9th-century Baghdad during the anarchy at Samarra, delivering a fresh installment in the long-running Assassin's Creed series. Developed and published by Ubisoft, this thirteenth major release in the series follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, Assassin's Creed Valhalla.\r\nThe game became available on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation on October 5, 2023, with a commendable support for previous-generation consoles. It's also set to release on iOS for iPhone 15 Pro and iPad M1+ models in early 2024.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Classic stealth oriented gameplay\r\n- One-hit assassinations are back\r\n- A more compact, shorter narrative experience that doesn't burnout players\r\n- Captures the unique beauty and charm of 9th-century Baghdad\r\n- Wide platform support (previous gens and older PCs)## Cons\r\n-Generic parkour system without much improvements\r\n-Weak and monotonous combat, arguably the worst in the series\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖 Story and Premise\r\nMirage offers players a narrative that revolves around Basim Ibn Ishaq, a character familiar to those who have played Valhalla. This story follows Basim's transformation from a street thief to a veteran member of the Hidden Ones, a group that stands for peace and freedom. They are in opposition to the Order of the Ancients, who seek peace through control. Both are precursors to the Assassins and Templars the mainline series is known for.\r\nThe game unfolds as a \"coming-of-age story\", set two decades before the events of Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Basim starts as a street thief and grows into a Hidden One under the guidance of his mentor, Roshan. True to the series' tradition, the game features historical figures from the 9th-century Baghdad, adding a layer of authenticity to the narrative. The game does away with mythologies and magic, and features a more grounded tone this time around. The story is now much shorted this time, around just 1/4 of the length of the previous game.\r\n## 🎨 Graphics and Art Style\r\nMirage's graphics and art style are not that impressive, the Anvil engine is showing its age, and the characters look really plasticy. However, I still commend Ubisoft for attention to detail with the world brought to life, immersing players in the historical setting of 9th-century Baghdad. While the graphics have basically stagnated since Assassin's Creed Origins, there is still beauty in this game.\r\n## 🎮 Gameplay Overview\r\nMirage aims to recapture the essence of earlier Assassin's Creed titles, placing a stronger emphasis on linear storytelling and stealth gameplay than recent RPG-focused entries. Parkour, close-quarter combat, and stealth remain at the core of the gameplay.\r\n## 🌲Well, does it return to its roots?\r\nNot exactly, its not a return to form just yet, more like 1/3 on the way there. While it doesn’t feature RPG elements anymore like XP leveling, numbered damages, and ridiculously high health points, it still doesn’t quite capture that classic Assassin’s Creed feel just yet, at least gameplay wise.\r\nSince its using the same engine without much modifications, It inevitably still shares a lot of elements from the past three “RPG” games, but heavily stripped down to try and capture that old AC feel. The parkour system is almost the exact same as the last three games far as I’ve noticed. Which was to say, underwhelming compared to older titles like Unity and even Black Flag. It’s just there to let you climb buildings and travel vertically, nothing more, nothing less. As far as being graceful, fluid, or reliable, it’s not any of those things.\r\nAssassin's Creed Mirage still features a skill tree system to unlocking new moves and abilities, but the skill points are now given upon mission competitions instead of accumulating experience points. Players can still upgrade their character’s gear, weapons, and cosmetics, but only to a limited degree that doesn’t entirely change how the game plays.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat is still a third person Souls-like style of combat, where parries and dodges are the main line of defense. Instead of AC: Origin’s Shield, or Odyssey’s and Valhalla’s dual wield or two handed weapons, Basim is limited to wielding a sword for combat and a dagger on the off hand for parrying. The classic Hidden Blade makes its return for swift assassinations. Finally, you can now do one-hit assassinations again without much trouble.\r\nDespite its efforts to return to its roots, the combat still feels like Valhalla just without the spongy enemies and numbers. It still doesnt beat the good ol classic Assassin’s Creed combat with 2-3 enemy counters and the ability to pickup and use any weapon around. In Mirage, the combat can be somewhat underwhelming and arguably the worst in the series. Parrying is too easy and monotonous, and there is no depth to it, even when you’ve unlocked all skill points. Mirage features just three distinct enemy types: ranged, melee, and unparryable big guys.\r\n## 🥷Stealth is back, front and center, at least\r\nWhile it hasn't fully returned to its roots, Assassin's Creed Mirage is a pleasant nod to the series' roots. The game places a strong emphasis on stealthy gameplay, which is favored in most, if not all, of the missions. It is complemented by level design that caters to this gameplay direction. Classic mechanics like eavesdropping, blending in with crowds, and enlisting the aid of civilians to further your objectives are back.\r\nIn contrast to the RPG games in the series, where stealth opportunities were limited, Mirage offers a much more enjoyable stealth experience. In major assassination missions, the level design compels players to investigate the environment to uncover varies approaches for reaching and dispatching their targets.\r\nAdditionally, Mirage introduces a new ability called \"Assassin Focus.\" This powerful ability allows players to dispatch multiple enemies simultaneously, and replenishes its use when executing stealth assassinations. When activated, time halts, enabling the player to designate up to five enemies who are subsequently eliminated by Basim in rapid succession. It’s similar to Dead Eye from Red Dead Redemption, or perhaps Mark and Execute from Splinter Cell: Blacklist. This ability is a bit out of place for a game returning to its roots, but its a nice feature nonetheless that encourages Stealth and Assassination gameplay above all.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI played this game on my Xbox Series S, which ran with a surprisingly 60FPS performance mode, absolutely stable. It’s also highly commendable job well done for supporting older gen titles like the Xbox One and PS4. PC wise, the game supports a range of lower than expected hardware configs, which is a good thing. However, the game is suffering from slight stuttering and frame drop drops for PC as of now.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nAssassin's Creed Mirage isn’t exactly a return to its roots yet with its poor combat and existing baggage left by the “RPG” games. However, it’s a good step in the right direction with its focus on stealth, assassination, and gameplay mechanics to support this direction. To truly succeed, the next two games should continue down this path, shedding more remnants of the \"RPG era\" while reintroducing classic elements. Maybe start by actually coming up with a next gen engine or a substantial overhaul of the existing one to better cater to the classic style of play.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6422935) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Assassin's Creed Mirage is a \"coming-of-age story,\" for Basim starts as a street thief and grows into a Hidden One under the guidance of his mentor, Roshan. True to the series' tradition, the game features historical figures from the 9th-century Baghdad. The game does away with mythologies and magic, and features a more grounded tone this time around. The story is now much shorted this time, around just 1/4 of the length of the previous game.\r\nIt's set to release on iOS for iPhone 15 Pro and Ipad M1+ models in early 2024, with the recent release last October 5, 2023 for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.\r\nAssassin's Creed Mirage aims to recapture the essence of earlier Assassin's Creed titles, placing a stronger emphasis on linear storytelling and stealth gameplay than recent RPG-focused entries. Parkour, close-quarter combat, and stealth remain at the core of the gameplay. The game is even being marketed as a \"return to the series' roots\"\r\nHowever, the return to the series' roots is a gradual process. While it has shed many RPG elements, such as XP leveling and number-based damage systems, it hasn't fully recaptured the classic Assassin's Creed feel. The parkour system, for instance, feels largely unchanged, lacking the grace and fluidity seen in earlier titles. The also combat still retains some elements from Assassin's Creed Valhalla ableit also stripped down to a bare minimum that is arguably the weakest combat system that I've seen in an Assassin's Creed game.\r\nWell, there's still work to be done to fully recapture the classic feel of the series, but Assassin's Creed Mirage is definitely a step in the right direction for the series, embracing its roots by focusing on stealth, assassination, and linear storytelling.\r\nAs said earlier, the game is also coming to mobile devices, and I can't wait to replay this game on Apple mobile phones and tablets, to see what it's going to be like performance and visuals-wise.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6422818) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "REC.O.R.D\r\n6.7\r\nAction\r\nFPS\r\nDownload\r\n## 🤔This game looks familiar?\r\nWhen I first saw the game reveal of Unrecord four months ago, I was immediately wowed by its ultra-realistic graphics that use body cam-style first-person perspective, blending seamlessly with photorealistic visuals and animations resulting in terrifyingly lifelike visuals. However, this is not Unrecord, but a mobile game titled REC.O.R.D. It's pretty darn close though, even the similar names speaks for themselves.\r\n## ✨Game Overview\r\nWhile Unrecord is still unreleased and basically dead silent as far as public updates go ever since the viral announcement four months ago, REC.O.R.D. is actually playable right now, with a very early preview version that feels more like a proof of concept than an actual finished product. However, I can't help but be impressed. They actually beat the original to the punch as far as coming up with a tangible, playable, game. Way before its inspiration. The preview version is free to try, but there are in-game ads every time you enter and exit a match.\r\nLooking at REC.O.R.D., it feels like a game made for PC hastily adapted for mobile devices, because it resembles a PC game UI wise. Extensive graphics settings are available for fine-tuning the game to match your device's specifications, complete with small fonts typically reserved for PC gaming.  Honestly, it just made the “port” even more impressive.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nThe graphics of REC.O.R.D are indeed amazing and photorealistic, especially for a mobile game, there’s zero doubt that REC.O.R.D. is totally inspired by the idea ignited by Unrecord. However, the game's appeal largely ends here. The game itself is basically a proof of concept, not even worthy to be called a Demo.\r\nIt only features one map “Factory”, which aesthetically and visually looks close to the abandoned looking map featured on the Unrecord reveal, but a lot smaller. REC.O.R.D most likely used real-life scans of the environment to achieve a photorealistic effect to a convincing degree. However, the weapons and character models are a bit less impressive, and looks much more from a normal video game instead.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay centers around team-based deathmatches within these confined spaces,  until the time runs out, offering zero variety.. There are different servers in place around the globe, but most are understandably empty, and the game connects by default to US NSW, regardless of actual location. I was able to play a few matches with a handful of players dropping in and out of the game. It was visually impressive, but frustratingly horrible from a gameplay standpoint.\r\nIt suffers mainly because the controls are horrible as of this current state. There is a noticeable “dead zone” for my touch inputs resulting in very inaccurate movement and aim. No amount of sensitivity setting fixes this. This proof of concept could have also benefited from bots, to be able to play TDM without the need of actual players, but for some reason it was removed (The Playstore screenshots showed bot players).\r\nThese issues hamper the entire experience and transforms what could have been an enjoyable proof of concept into something only mildly interesting. Gameplay wise, the game adopts a realistic approach. Guns are loud and effective, and single bullet hits are already deadly. There’s foundation for a class system already in place. I can select Recon, Engineer, Strike, or Support, but there’s no real implementation yet. There are four weapons available to try: Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Pistol, and Knife.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nREC.O.R.D. showcases remarkable potential with its stunning photorealistic graphics, clearly influenced by the aspirations of Unrecord. Yet, it remains in a nascent state, more a proof of concept than a fully-fledged game. If you want to get a glimpse of what Unrecord is like, on your mobile phone no less, there's no harm in giving this a try. Just don’t expect more than a few minutes worth of amusement.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6425931) Originally posted on TapTap.",

You might have seen the original inspiration for this tilted Unrecord, which was unveiled 4 months ago to viral acclaim. Both are still unreleased, but REC.O.R.D. beats the original by having an actual playable early test version.\r\nIs it as realistic too? Yes it is. However the visuals aren't as sharp as Unrecord, as there's only so much a mobile phone can do. Visually, it uses the same techniques and styles that result in a photorealistic graphics.\r\nIn terms of gameplay, there isn't much here at the moment. There's only one map, an almost non-existent number of players, and the FPS touch controls leave much to be desired. Nevertheless, it's still worth a try, as there's nothing quite like it in the market right now.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6425928) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It's basically a Dota/MOBA like game that instead features popular characters from popular Animes such as Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, and more.\r\nWell, JUMP: Assemble is exactly that game fully realized into full pledge MOBA for mobile devices, and it comes with official license from Weekly Shōnen Jump! It features characters from eighth different Weekly Shonen Jump properties: One Piece. Dragon Ball. Naruto. Bleach. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Jujutsu Kaisen, Undead, Unluck, Mashle: Magic and Muscles.\r\nIf you're familiar with mobile MOBA games, then this is easy to pick up and play. It feels exactly like Mobile Legends, even the announcer’s voice and lines are heavily inspired by it. The game features typical MOBA character roles like Mage, Fighter, Jungler, Support, and Tank. The three-lane layout, with top, mid, and bottom lanes, provides a classic MOBA structure.  The game is enjoyable as a MOBA title, with various character types and diverse skills. Examples include AOE attacks, movement skills, stuns, heals, and knockbacks.\r\nThis game made is currently on a limited slots beta testing, and I'm fortunate to be among those who gained access. Slots have been consistently opened for three consecutive days, so far always at around 11 AM GMT+8.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6435900) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "7.9\r\nMultiplayer\r\nRPG\r\nPre-register\r\n## ✨Overview\r\n## 🚧Limited Beta Test\r\nThis game made is currently on a limited slots beta testing, and I was fortunate to be among those who was able to join in. Slots have been consistently opened for three consecutive days, so far always at around 11 AM GMT+8.\r\nUpon creating your avatar and completing a set of tutorials, you step into the third-person mode lobby, a vibrant 3D space brimming with various sections, including different game modes such as normal and ranked play, and the store. It's still somewhat barebones; there's no background music yet in some scenes. However, this extra element adds a nice touch considering it's a MOBA game.\r\n## 📺Graphics, Art-style and Voice-overs\r\nThe game presents itself with cel-shaded visuals that are crisp and vibrant. The battleground, called  the \"All-Star Arena,\" draws inspiration from various anime worlds, with elements reminiscent of Dragon Ball, One Piece, and others with its monsters, towers, and map.\r\nThe character animations and skills are amazing and tantalizing, and for anime fans, this is where JUMP: Assemble captures the anime feel. The attention to detail in replicating characters like Naruto or Goku in 3D cel-shaded form commonly seen in modern Anime video games now.\r\nFurthermore, characters come with original voice-overs, adding authenticity to the experience. While some voice-overs are still in progress, the promise of complete character voice-overs upon the game's official release is exciting.\r\nAside from the overall gameplay format, the UI design seems to borrow exact elements from Mobile Legends and features a comic-book style aesthetics. Manga panels serve as background visuals, and everything here seems very immersive for an Anime-inspired video game.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nIf you're familiar with mobile MOBA games, then this is easy to pick up and play. It feels exactly like Mobile Legends, even the announcer’s voice and lines are heavily inspired by and sounds very similar.\r\nJump Assemble offers a familiar MOBA experience, allowing players to choose from various roles, including Mage, Fighter, Jungler, Support, and Tank. The three-lane layout, with top, mid, and bottom lanes, provides a classic MOBA structure .The variety in character abilities and roles ensures that players have plenty of options to suit their preferences. Of course, I expect the support will be the least favorite role, as usual.\r\nThe game introduces unique elements, such as red and blue buffs spawning at the 30-second mark and the first objective at the two-minute mark. Players can reach a maximum level of 15, with access to their ultimate ability at level 4. Battle Skills, Flash skills, Retribution skills for Junglers, and Scoot for temporary movement speed boosts add depth to the gameplay. This is almost an exact replica of the Mobile Legends’ formula, which isn’t a bad thing as it means its going to be easy to pick up and get popular.\r\nThe game is enjoyable, with various character types and diverse skills. Examples include AOE attacks, movement skills, stuns, heals, and knockbacks.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game allows you to select one free starting character, which can be either Luffy, Naruto, or Goku. The rest of the characters can be unlocked by playing and earning points or by spending money to purchase characters and cosmetics. Progression is further incentivized through live service elements such as daily logins, events, and passes.\r\nIn my case, I chose Luffy, but I won't be able to unlock Naruto or Goku next immediately. I'll have to go through other supporting characters first. This isn't a drawback, as they are all designed to be equally powerful and balanced, given it's a MOBA. Some are better suited for killing, others for tanking, and some for support. If you want to play your favorite character, the pressure is on to either grind or pay. As common in hero-based games, teams can't choose identical characters simultaneously, although two opposing teams can have the same characters facing each other.\r\nOverall, the roster features 25 characters from eight prominent anime and manga series, including Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, Undead Unluck, and Mashle. Each character comes with a unique set of skills and abilities, catering to different playstyles. As mentioned earlier, unlocking characters involves playing and accumulating points or purchasing them with real money.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game looks sharp and crips, runs smoothly and is very stable from my testing, with no crashes or freezes experience. During my testing with my Snapdragon 888 device, it can reach up to a 90FPS ceiling. However, it doesn't feel as smooth as the indicators are showing, and the overall feel of the game seems closer to 30FPS for some reason.\r\nConclusion\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6435901) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The world is beautifully designed, offering captivating environments and intricate details. Players can easily get lost in the mesmerizing architecture and dark ambiance. The art style is reminiscent of the Dark Souls series, with its Dark Fantasy Medieval theme mixed in with grotesque eldritch horrors, akin to those found in Bloodborne. However, the visuals aren't perfect. The characters are definitely the weakest part of the visuals. Human characters look plastic, and the close-ups during cutscenes expose the low quality details used in their textures and models.\r\n## 📖Story\r\nThe game presents a dark and treacherous world divided into the physical Axiom realm and the shadowy Umbral plane that also serves as the games underlying and signature mechanic, much similar to the recent horror game The Medium. Players step into a world teeming with eldritch horrors and embark on a journey filled with deep lore and emotional depth. The narrative sets the stage for an epic adventure, driven by players' choices and profound consequences. It connects to the first game very loosely, and it set many years after the game’s conclusion, with the once defeated evil Adyr now regaining back its strength once again. As one of the few chosen warriors blessed with immortality (AKA the Souls-like respawn mechanic of the game), you've been assigned a sacred mission by a religious order to ignite five beacons scattered throughout the land to stop the resurgence of Adyr.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core of any Souls-like game is its gameplay, and Lords of the Fallen offers a diverse array of character classes, playstyles, and weapon combinations to experiment with. Players can choose to be brawny bruisers with swords and shields, nimble characters dual wielding weapons, or a variety of ranged magic users. Lock targets to enemies, dodge, parry, and block your way into the game’s exploratory but kinda linear campaign.\r\nThe concept of dual realities, with the physical Axiom world layered over the eerie Umbral world, has the potential to draw players into a richly woven narrative of otherworldly abominations and eldritch horrors. In this game, players navigate the physical realm while also having access to the shadowy Umbral world through a magical lantern, both via the lamp’s light or by fully and directly transporting yourself to the alternate reality. This mechanic adds an intriguing layer to exploration and combat. For instance, a broken bridge or a closed gate in the physical world may become crossable in Umbral, opening up new avenues for exploration. A river might just be sunken pathway, dry and traversable in the Umbral world.\r\nThe ability to use the lantern's light to interact with the Umbral plane without fully entering it provides an exciting twist, making exploration more about deciphering each area's secrets, and the game becomes less of an action but more of an exploration or puzzle-solving when presented with these segments.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nLords of the Fallen’s combat is a bit of a mixed bag. It attempts to blend the familiar elements from FromSoftware's Dark Souls series with its unique mechanics. The combat can be satisfying, hits feel weighty, the weapons are varied and have multiple stances to mix and match, and I found the parry, block, and dodge mechanics a bit more forgiving. Especially the block/parry wither mechanic that essentially acts as a buffer to your HP, and one more chance to regain that lost HP back when inflicting damage. With that mechanic, I was able to go toe to toe with enemies and bosses more often, and it encourages actually taking risks with your attacks instead of extremely playing it safe by dodging and chipping in small amounts of damage. Upon death, you are also given one more chance to revive in the Umbral realm and continue the fight. In this respect, its basically a Souls-lite instead of a Souls-like.\r\nThe combat system has its share of issues. Attacks, while powerful and weight, can feel somewhat clunky and imprecise. Hits often don't land as intended, making combat less fluid than I am used to. The dodge mechanic also feels off. The lack of fluidity in the combat experience is definitely noticeable. Which is a shame because the underlying mechanics behind it are promising.\r\n## 🗡️Bosses are fun, regular enemies are not\r\nUnlike recent Souls-like titles, the bosses in Lords of the Fallen are easier. Still challenging, but instead of efeling seemingly impossible, you can easily see yourself beating these bosses the first few times you encounter them. Their movesets are predictable and not particularly challenging. However, there are problems with camera angles and controls, which can make these encounters more frustrating than they should be. The game's regular enemies on the other hand offer a more challenge experience, albet more frustrating too. Enemies play hide and seek and ambush too much, and consistently puts you in dire and tense situations.\r\n## 🕹A failed co-op implementation\r\nWhile advertised as co-op-friendly, the game falls short of expectations. Guests in another player's world can't interact with NPCs, pick up items, or trade with traders. Thety receive way less souls and doesn’t even have the extra revive. It’s basically a singleplayer experience with drop-in player assist, which is the worst kind of co-op implementation for me.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nAt first the game was stuttering heavily, even the movie cutscenes and main menu were laughably stuttering. However, after a driver update and a reboot, things initially looked promising on my i7-8700k, RTX 3080 system. However, as soon as I left the starting area, I encountered glaring performance issues once again. Erratic frametimes, poor and unstable frame rates, and visual bugs like heavy texture pop-ins were prevalent.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nLords of the Fallen had the potential to shine even amidst the immense success of Elden Ring and more recently, Lies of P. Its refreshing dual-reality mechanic and forgiving but still challenging combat system had the potential to set it apart. However, technical issues, combat annoyances, and the poor co-op experience hold it back. Who knows? Maybe this will be patched in the future, but for now, I would advise waiting for a sale, that is if you are running out of better Souls-like games to play.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6443254) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Total War: PHARAOH\r\n6.9\r\nAction\r\nStrategy\r\nTotal War: PHARAOH is an refreshing addition to the popular Total War series, with a unique blend of historical strategy and grandeur, set in ancient Egypt. Developed by Creative Assembly, this title delves deep into the mystical world of pharaohs and pyramids, delivering a gaming experience that is somewhat both exhilarating and educational… ableit with creative liberties.\r\nIt is a full-on PC game released on Steam with no console or mobile ports for now. However for mobile players looking to try out a game of this caliber, you can pretty much play their older titles like Total War: MEDIEVAL II and ROME: Total War or any modern android device and experience mobile grand strategy at its finest.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Stays true to the franchise's core formula, and even back to its historical roots\r\n- New weather effects that affect the battles\r\n- New campaign mechanics\r\n- Impressive detailed visuals\r\n- Smooth performance## Cons\r\n-Poor AI behavior\r\n-Clunky unit combat\r\n-Feels like an expansion instead of a full-on Total War entry\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nThe graphics of Total War has evolved a lot throughout the years from tiny low poly units to detailed individual units even on par with third person video game levels of fidelity. Total War: PHARAOH continues that evolution and is nothing short of spectacular. The game transports players to the heart of ancient Egypt, with stunning attention to detail with the architecture and environments. The graphics are more crisp and sharp, and the monotonous sand throughout its setting adds a certain asthetic that makes the game look more smooth and clay-like. However, the game brings a refreshing twist to the table with novel mechanics, enriching the experience for historical Total War fans.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nTotal War: PHARAOH stays true to the franchise's core formula, which combines turn-based grand strategy and real-time battles. Players step into the role of an Egyptian ruler, overseeing the grandeur of an ancient civilization as they vie to become the Pharaoh. The game offers a refreshing change of pace from the recent Fantastical settings of Total War, and returns back to its historical roots as it immerses players in the complexities of managing an Egyptian dynasty.\r\nIn contrast to Total War: Troy, Total War: Three Kingdoms, or Total War: Warhammer, Total War: PHARAOH wisely steps away from turning leaders into demigod-like figures portrayed as superhero like units. This is a more grounded approach that aligns well with the historical setting and the tone of the game. Although, it still features immortal leaders, which limits the potential for alternate stories and character deaths.\r\n## 🗺Campaign\r\nThe heart of PHARAOH is its campaign mode, a complex web of diplomacy, resource management, and warfare. Building and governing your Egyptian dynasty is no small feat. Players navigate the world through a familiar top-down isometric view, where cities are spread across the whole region.\r\nDiplomacy plays a pivotal role, allowing you to interact with neighboring factions, forge alliances, and pursue your strategic objectives. Total War players will find themselves at ease with the user interface and mechanics, which have become staples of the series.\r\nEach faction in Total War: PHARAOH brings its own unique flavor to the campaign. Players can choose to lead the mighty Egyptians, the resurgent Hittites, or other distinctive factions. These factions have their distinct units, culture, and playstyles, the developers have really tried their best do differentiate these so that every campaign feels different.\r\n## 🏘Outposts, Religions, and Economy\r\nA significant new addition to Total War: PHARAOH's city management is the introduction of outposts. These outposts, smaller than traditional cities, allow players to strategically position their influence across the map. This feature requires careful consideration of what type of outpost to build, adding a layer of strategy to the game. Defensive and economic outposts can be crucial for maintaining a growing empire, while outposts related to faith support the religious aspect of gameplay. This feature is a nice addition to the game and perhaps livens up the rather bland region we are playing in.\r\nThe game also introduces a pantheon of deities that players can worship, each granting unique bonuses. Worshipping up to three gods at a time, you gain access to their shrines and temples. A nice touch to the game, but something we have seen before in previous titles.\r\nResource management and trade is at the core of the economic system in Total War: PHARAOH. The game's Bronze Age setting offers an array of resources and a slightly different take on trading. These resources are not only essential for maintaining your armies and settlements but also for trading with other factions. As a player, you must strike a balance between resource production, trade, and military expenditure to ensure the growth and prosperity of your empire.\r\nEstablishing trade routes is a crucial aspect of the game's economic strategy. You can form alliances and trade agreements with neighboring factions to secure access to their resources and expand your trade network. This network can provide your empire with valuable resources that might be otherwise unavailable, enabling you to maintain strong armies and develop your settlements.\r\n## ⚔️Battles\r\nBattles in the game largely follow the tried-and-true formula of the Total War series. Players deploy their troops according to their strategic plans, and the chaos of battle unfolds. However, units in Total War: PHARAOH feel more substantial, granting players greater control over their movements. Leaders, while not equipped with the fantastical abilities seen in titles like Total War: Warhammer, fit seamlessly into the historical context of the game.\r\nTotal War: PHARAOH maintains the classic feel of Total War battles, but with some exciting dynamic features. Each battle begins with a weather forecast, introducing weather effects that influence the course of the fight. These weather conditions can either boost or hinder your forces, adding an extra layer of strategy. For instance, a battle in the rain might reduce archers' accuracy, while fog can obscure visibility. These weather dynamics inject freshness into the battles, making them more engaging and dynamic.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance and additional drawbacks\r\nThe game also ran perfectly on my i7-8700k, RTX 3080 PC, which was surprising as Total War games tends to be one of the most CPU-heavy games I play, and my processor is 6 years old at this point. My game ran smoothly, even in large battles. Although I can’t help but notice that the graphics engine, while still impressive in most respects, is showing signs of aging. LOD pop-ins are still a problem, and animations still looks clunky sometimes. Enemy units 1v1-ing each other locked in an animation is back and is now a problem again that I can’t overlook, in which games like Rome and Medieval 2 infinitely did better.\r\nOne of the game's notable downsides is the AI, which can sometimes display baffling behavior, both for your enemies and your own units. This means fair amount of micromanagement during battles. While this can be a bit frustrating, it doesn't detract significantly from the overall experience. Fortunately you can pause the game speed during battles.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nTotal War: PHARAOH is a solid entry in the Total War series. While it may not reach the heights of Total War: Warhammer, Three Kingdoms, or Medieval II, it is a game well worth playing for Total War enthusiasts, and even for those diving in for the first time. I would say that for newcomers, this is a viable first game, as it doesn't redefine the series or set the bar higher. This means you'll still be able to enjoy older games in the series without a significant downgrade in the experience, but it some respects it feels like an expansion instead of a true sequel, Also, the price is a bit higher than usual, but overall it offers a robust strategy experience with excellent campaign mechanics, large scale battles, great presentation, and a refreshing bold new era.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6441349) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "I first noticed this interesting game -- Lords of the Fallen -- many years ago on Steam, but I never got around to playing it. It appeared on my radar quite a few times, especially during Steam sales, but I never had the chance to try it. Fortunately, they made a reboot, and I played that instead.\r\nIn this game, players navigate the physical realm while also having access to the shadowy Umbral world through a magical lantern, both via the lamp’s light or by fully and directly transporting yourself to the alternate reality.  We also have a more forgiving combat system, with a balanced implementation of using dodges, blocks, and parries. The wither system designed to buffer your HP from attacks is a commendable feature, and encourages actually taking risks with your attacks instead of extremely playing it safe.\r\nThe game features new mechanics and novel ways to spice up the Souls-like gameplay, which is refreshing to see. However, I experienced a bit of mechanic overload at the start. The game is explaining things at an accelerate rate, like using the lamp to peer into the alternate world and maybe traversing through it, gathering and pulling souls from enemies, the dual stance mechanic of weapons, or perhaps the wither mechanic that goes hand in hand with blocking and parrying.\r\nWhen I started the game, there were so many stutters at first; even the movie cutscenes were stuttering. However, after a driver update and a reboot, things initially looked promising on my i7-8700k, RTX 3080 system. However, as soon as I left the starting area, I encountered glaring performance issues. Erratic frame times, poor and unstable frame rates, and visual bugs like heavy texture pop-ins were prevalent. Overall, this game looks fun and feels like a Souls-lite game instead of a true Souls-like, but the technical issues are severely undermining this game's potential.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6443253) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE is a Gacha 6v6 Autobattler game allowing players to engage in strategic battles featuring an array of beloved mobile suits and pilots. With its recent global release, this game is now accessible to fans worldwide.\r\nThe game offers an enticing blend of classic Gundam lore and a new narrative that combines animation with engaging battles and adventures. It's possibly a dream come true for fans of the Universal Century timeline, as it brings together various iconic characters and mobile suits in a single mobile game.\r\nThe gameplay primarily revolves around assembling squads of mobile suits and pilots, with gacha mechanics playing a crucial role in collecting them. While I found the strategic element to be super simple and borderline an illusion for players, the ability to collect and upgrade different mech suits and pilots is sure to be delight to Gundam fans/\r\nThe battles themselves are automated, with the option to activate the EX ability manually --- again, an illusion of choice as it too, can be automated anyway.  As with many mobile games, MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE incorporates gacha mechanics, which can be enticing but also present a potential pitfall as they are put into separate banners and can be costly to both acquire.\r\nThere isn't really much of an \"actual\" gundam gameplay here. You cannot directly control your Gundam team, the strategic element is a smoke and mirrors at best, and most of the gameplay is centered on the gundam collecting mechanic and experiencing the visual spectacle of the battles. Which honestly, is still a draw on its own especially for Gundam fans. The narrative angle is also a strong suit, as it both features revists and new storylines for the UC timeline.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6449465) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE\r\n7.5\r\nSimulation\r\nStrategy\r\nDownload\r\nMOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE catapults players into the heart of the iconic Gundam universe, delivering an epic Gundam auto-battler gacha experience on mobile devices. Released globally this October 17th, two years after it’s release in Japan, It combines the rich lore of the Universal Century with an exciting new storyline that seamlessly blends animation and thrilling battle sequences.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Gundam universe immersion\r\n- Narrative, both classic and new\r\n- Collecting your favorite Gundam and Pilots\r\n- The visuals capture the essence of Gundam battles\r\n- Can pretty much skip everything and fast forward the battles## Cons\r\n-Limited gameplay elements and strategic depth\r\n-Outdated looking presentation and menu systems\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nMOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE immerses players in the Universal Century timeline. The game brings together a plethora of beloved mobile suits and their respective pilots, offering fans the opportunity to assemble their dream teams. Animated cutscenes and scenes taken from the anime adds depth to the game's narrative, making it a must-play for Gundam UC fans. The game's promise of a new storyline alongside classic lore ensures an engaging experience for both newcomers and veterans of the franchise.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nWhile MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE might not push the boundaries of mobile game graphics, it effectively captures the essence of the Gundam universe. The visuals reminded me of an HD version of the PS3 game Battle Operation, featuring clay-like aesthetics and straightforward simplistic 3D environments. The battles, however, stand out as visually spectacular, with mobile suits engaging in combat across diverse terrains, including cities, space, and underwater. Some clumsy animations and weird movements, but overall is visually pleasing to watch. The menu and UI is a bit outdated looking, feels like something that came out in the PS2 era.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nGameplay primarily centers around forming squads of mobile suits and pilots, acquired through gacha mechanics. Players can level up both suits and characters, enhance their power level, and change pilots to influence their effectiveness in battle.\r\nThe game presents players with an opportunity to engage in thrilling 6 vs. 6 battles with an array of iconic mobile suits, each piloted by characters from the Gundam universe. The battles themselves are largely automated, which may disappoint those seeking more hands-on engagement. The only control you have is the placement of units and activating the EX ability with features flashy animated moves.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThere is a slight strategic layer to the battles, by way of positioning mobile suits and using the rock-paper-scissors like weakness system but in practice, it doesn't really carry significant weight, and even using the EX ability can be automated. The camera can change between top-down view or third person mode to either get an overview of the battle or a close-up of the skirmishes, however the placement could have been more improved as currently it’s kind of a mess and does not really do a good job of showing the action.\r\nThe core gameplay doesn't offer a significant level of depth or strategy. The primary objective revolves around leveling up your mobile suits to maximize their power and defeat the enemy by overpowering their units.\r\n## ♟️🤖 Gacha + Auto Chess + Gundam\r\nIn essence, MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE operates as an auto-battler or autochess game with gacha elements, carried by the popular Gundam IP. While the combat is visually appealing and the concept of positioning units offers a promising start, it ultimately leans towards automation, limiting the depth of player engagement. Nevertheless, the spectacular EX moves and the opportunity to command your favorite Gundams make the combat an enticing aspect of the game.\r\n## ⏩Control over the pacing\r\nYou can skip pretty much everything: cutscenes, movies, and even fast forward the gameplay. Although you need to pay for game/x3 speed. I did notice there are a lot of loading/connecting screens present and while I didn’t find this an issue, it may potentially annoy other players.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nMOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE starts players off with a generous influx of in-game resources, including an AP system to regulate playtime. Early-game progression is comfortable, even granting access to rare characters through gacha pulls, in which I received on UR early on, and multiple SR characters.  I haven’t reach the far ends of the game, but I hope the developers strike a balance that ensures an enjoyable experience for free-to-play players too. For the first few hours though, progression isn’t really an issue and there is a 72 hour Limited MS and Character Gacha for 6% chance.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nMOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE offers an exciting revisit into the Gundam universe. The game's greatest strength lies in its narrative, which blends classic lore with fresh adventures and captivating animated cutscenes. Although the visuals may not be groundbreaking, they succeed in capturing the essence of Gundam's epic mecha battles. The gameplay predominantly relies on auto-battles and gacha mechanics, which may not suit everyone's preferences. However, the game's early generosity make it an appealing choice for Gundam enthusiasts to at least give it a chance.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6449484) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players can engage in side missions, activities, and even enjoy One Punch Man-themed arcade games. The freedom to explore at your own pace adds depth to the game and allows for a more immersive experience.\r\nOf course, don't forget that this game is a gacha: collect new heroes, and change team compositions and strategies.

    "body": "One Punch Man: WorldSEA\r\n8.5\r\nRPG\r\nAction\r\nPC Version\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nOne Punch Man: World delivers an action-adventure gacha experience with the official One Punch Man license, immersing players in the world of Saitama, the unstoppable One Punch Man himself. The game covers the first season of the anime but also includes new original stories involving other side characters for the main quest and game progression. Additionally, it incorporates some extended combat sequences from anime fight scenes, further enhancing the action-oriented gameplay. The game is yet to release, but a closed beta test that started October 18 is now ongoing.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nThe graphics showcase cel-shaded visuals typical of anime video game adaptations, and the overall presentation is executed exceptionally. Many scenes from the anime are faithfully recreated using this graphics engine. It looks so impressive that they could potentially use this engine to generate authentic anime fight sequences. It’s that good that if they just use this to generate Season 3 and beyond, I wouldn’t actually mind and it’ll probably be even better than Season 2. While the voice actors from the anime are returning, I found many of the segments still lack voice-overs, so there is a bit of reading involved during dialogues.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nOne Punch Man: World adopts a gacha game model with action-oriented gameplay, akin to titles like Genshin Impact and Aether Gazer. Players can assemble a team of up to four heroes, embarking on missions and quests to combat menacing monsters and villains. The gameplay is typical of action games, granting players the freedom to move, dodge/block, and activate three unique abilities for each hero. Additionally, there's an ultimate ability known as \"MAX\" activated by filling an attack meter, and a Link Attack mechanic that encourages synergistic play among your party members. While all four characters are present simultaneously during battles, you must select a main character to control before the battle commences. No seamless character switching or tagging.\r\nEvery hero in One Punch Man: World possesses a distinct ability set, offering varied mechanics to enhance your gameplay experience. Even if with the same heroes, different variants with distinct abilities are available. For example, my SSR Genos can seamlessly switch between melee and ranged attacks as part of his combo attacks, while another Genos variant I used in story missions have a whole different ability set that are more catered to ranged playstyle.\r\n## 🥊Combat\r\nThe combat in One Punch Man: World is an absolute BLAST, mirroring the action-packed feel of the anime. Every strike delivers a satisfying punch, accompanied by stunning visual effects faithful to the magnitude displayed by the Anime.  Of course, there needs to be a bit of suspension of disbelief, especially when playing as Saitama in the introduction quest as the enemies don’t die in a single punch, although the incredible stopping power of Saitama is still translated excellently into this hack-and-slash-style gameplay.\r\n## 📜Progression\r\nAfter the introduction sequence, the pace slows down as we're introduced to side characters such as Lightning Max, Smile Man, and Golden Ball. We initially follow their stories and activities within the Hero Association. Periodically, we transition to key anime events from the first season, taking control of characters like Saitama and Genos to battle monsters like Vaccine Man and Mosquito Girl.\r\nWhile we initially control Lightning Max, we can pull new heroes to our roster using the gacha system in place. During this beta, I was able to get an SSR Genos immediately which I used as my main. These heroes can be leveled up, their skills augmented, and enchanced that can also affect their power. Players can also pull “Arms” via the gacha system, which are used to augment characters.\r\nOutside of combat, the game treats us to various side missions and random activities. It even allows players to explore the vibrant and beautiful Z-City at their own leisure. Convenience stores offer meals that provide stat boosts. The arcades are brimming with One Punch Man-inspired versions of classic games, including shooters, racing, VR, and fighting games. However, only one of these is currently playable: Panzer Cyborg, which is a subway surfer-esque platformer where players collect coins.\r\nAs of now, the game is generous across the board. It features a stamina/energy system called \"Intel\" designed to limit playtime, but this restriction wasn't a significant issue during my playthrough. As a gacha game, it incorporates familiar elements like login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, and premium currency. Additionally, it includes idle game elements for resource farming, albeit at the expense of more Intel. While the closed beta test is currently underway with gacha and premium currency in place, the final game model remains to be seen. I'm hopeful that the developers will strike a balance that ensures an enjoyable experience for free-to-play players as well.\r\n## 📊Beta Technical Performance\r\nThe game ran satisfactorily on my system, although I did experience occasional drops in performance during action-packed scenes on my Snapdragon 888 device while running at medium settings. The game supports frame rates of up to 60 and 120 FPS and offers limited controller support, although there are no prompts and navigation still relies on touch controls for certain functions. Since the game is also set to come on PC and judging from some of the game’s early screenshots, Keyboard and Mouse support will also be implemented.\r\n## ⚖️Beta Conclusion\r\nWith its faithful reimagining of iconic anime scenes, and action-oriented gameplay, One Punch Man: World successfully captures the essence of One Punch Man, offering an exciting journey for fans of the popular anime series or even those just experiencing the story for the first time. The combat system provides a satisfying and visually striking experience and beyond that, the game also offers more with the exploration  of Z-city and plenty of side activities. The only potential stumbling block that could mar this otherwise promising experience is a poorly implemented gacha mechanics upon its eventual release.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6452903) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Cyber Rebellion\r\n7.6\r\nRPG\r\nStrategy\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nCyber Rebellion is an upcoming mobile game that falls into the strategic hero collection genre with a cyberpunk theme. It's set in a future world, particularly in the year 2177, where human civilization has entered the Cyber Era.  the game is set to have its soft launch on October 25, and I was fortunate enough to get a sneak peek preview of the game before its release.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Stunning visuals and lively presentation\r\n- Character customization options\r\n- Engaging progression mechanics\r\n- Menu is accessible and easy to navigate## Cons\r\n-Combat is shallow\r\n-Voice acting and localization is underwhelming\r\n-The gacha wall draws near within your first few hours of play.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story\r\nThe game's storyline revolves around the destructive force known as \"[Apocalypse]\" that has released “α” viruses, causing the gradual erosion of the world's order. As a result, Skyfall City becomes humanity's last sanctuary. Players take on the role of the commander of Skyfall City, and their primary mission is to resist the attacks of the Invaders, which are robot-like creatures led by [Apocalypse].\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nCyber Rebellion stands out with its remarkable visuals; gorgeous, vibrant, and even looks like prerendered in certain shots. The game's glitchy stylized cyberpunk presentation and comic-book-inspired art style create an immersive and visually captivating world. Even the UI and Menus are sleek and heavily influenced by these Futuristic cyberpunk elements.  At present, there is little to no voice acting, and the English localization and voice acting appear to be somewhat underwhelmingly translated.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nCyber Rebellion features turn-based combat which are then automatically played out for the most part. Players can assemble a team of up to six characters, each with unique skills and abilities. During battles, as characters engage in combat, your team accumulates Tactical Points. These points, when filled, allow players to unleash a variety of character-specific abilities. There is an option to increase the game's speed to 2x and even automate battles, subject to your teams power level against the enemies’ power level.\r\nHowever, I found the actual combat lacking depth and predominantly relies on power levels for progression. The difference between manual selection of abilities and automation is minimal. The AI's performance in managing regular attacks is downright bad and annoying, as it sometimes leaves enemies with low HP alive, choosing to target other foes instead of prioritizing efficiently. This aspect might benefit from further refinement to enhance the strategic depth of combat.\r\n## ⏫Progression and Character Customization\r\nThe core of gameplay revolves around increasing the power of your team, referred to as \"BR.\" This can be achieved through character leveling, equipping \"Skill Codes,\" and utilizing Implants and Modules. The inclusion of a gacha system provides players with opportunities to acquire new and more powerful characters. Although there are a limited number of characters, the presence of multiple variants for each character expands the roster considerably. The character tree system, allowing for character modification and evolution to higher variants while retaining progress, enhances the depth of character customization.\r\n## ⚡️Mission Structure\r\nThere is an energy system called Neurocons that limits play and is consumed during combat-oriented missions. The main story is composed of different chapters, and I like how combat-packed the missions are, and not filled with cutscenes with battles few and far between. Apart from the main story, there are other combat-oriented game modes catered for the purpose of farming specific materials to increase the power of characters. I found the option to skip some of these modes after the first completion by expending more Neurocon for faster farming is a player-friendly feature. The upgrading and prerequisite system is seamlessly integrated into menus, making it accessible and easy to navigate.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nCyber Rebellion follows typical gacha game monetization patterns, including login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, and premium currency. As a free-to-play experience in its current state, I find the game already enjoyable, but expect a gacha wall when progressing through the main story even in the first few hours of play, despite the early-game bonuses and generosity. Nevertheless, the mechanics of how upgrades are implemented can be addictive in their own right. When you combine that with the stunning and visually appealing graphics, this game has the potential to become a daily farming mainstay for you.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nCyber Rebellion offers a captivating and visually striking cyberpunk adventure for mobile gamers. The game's strengths lie in its remarkable graphics, stylish presentation, and character customization options. While there are areas that can be enhanced, Cyber Rebellion shows promise as a game that can keep players engaged on a daily basis.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6454227) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "In Endless Dungeon, you explore a mysterious abandoned space station alongside other stranded heroes. Prepare for the dangers that lie ahead by managing your resources and constructing defenses, protecting the Crystal Bot from harm, and eliminating any hostiles that stand ready to kill you, be they monsters, bugs, or robots.\r\nThe game hooks you right in from the very start, from its initial tutorial to its actual rogue-lite gameplay, you’d want to keep playing for more. The objective: reach the core or perish in the attempt, and then try again with better knowledge and gear, rinse and repeat. Whether played solo or with friends, Endless Dungeon offers a fun-filled addicting experience.\r\nThe core loop of Endless Dungeon involves exploration, preparation, protection, and extermination. The layout of each district within the space station is procedurally generated, ensuring that no two runs are the same. As you explore, you'll uncover secrets, gather resources, and confront various enemy types and bosses. The game's dynamic and strategic gameplay seamlessly combines elements of turn-based games, tower defense, and twin-stick shooting. Players open doors to reveal rooms, and every room can house generators, turret slots, and enemy spawners. Waves of enemies trigger after opening doors, prompting you to defend your generators and the crystal bot.\r\nThe game is undeniably addictive. My first session started late at night, and I was already feeling somewhat drowsy by then. Without even realizing it, I continued playing until the early morning hours. The gameplay is incredibly diverse, with a fusion of different genres such as RTS, tower defense, twin-stick shooter, dungeon crawling, rogue-lite, and escort missions, ensuring that it never got boring. Plus, the progression system is highly rewarding, offering new upgrades, characters, and levels to uncover. As far as Rogue-lites go, this might just be one of the best ones of the year.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6456306) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "In the not-so-distant future of 2177, humanity faces an existential threat in the form of a cataclysmic event. It's in this dystopian setting that Cyber Rebellion takes center stage,  a mobile game poised for a soft launch on October 25, 2023, offering players a glimpse into a world on the brink of destruction, where advanced machines and robots have turned against their creators.\r\nCyber Rebellion introduces players to an engaging turn-based gameplay experience. Players can assemble a team of up to six characters, each with unique skills and abilities. While you don't control regular attacks, the game introduces a Tactical Points system that accumulates with normal attacks. These points can be strategically used to unleash powerful special attacks, not only adding strength to your arsenal but also providing visually captivating combat sequences.\r\nThe game offers a range of challenging combat modes, from the story mode and challenges, to epic battles with world bosses, ensuring that there's always a thrilling challenge to overcome. Cyber Rebellion offers a deep character upgrade system, allowing players to customize the transformation strategy of each warrior. I can even evolve my characters into other higher variants, and keep the same level, which is nice as I don't always have to pull new characters and re-level in order to increase my team power.\r\nI am already smelling a grind/pay wall in my first few hours of play, even still, the mechanics of how upgrades are done can be addicting enough on its own right, combine that with the stunning and eye candy visuals and this is game that can be a mainstay for you for a daily farming basis.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6454193) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "ENDLESS™ Dungeon\r\n8.3\r\nAction\r\nStrategy\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nEndless Dungeon is a genre-defying rogue-lite that merges elements of dungeon crawling, twin-stick shooter, and tower defense genres. Developed by AMPLITUDE Studios and part of the ENDLESS franchise of video games, this co-op action roguelike takes players on an adrenaline-pumping journey through the ruins of a long-abandoned space station.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Masterful execution of multiple genres\r\n- Gorgeous visuals\r\n- Fluid performance\r\n- Varied gameplay; from action to survival to resource management\r\n- Engaging progression## Cons\r\n-Missed opportunity for local co-op (it doesn't have one)\r\n-Commanding AI companions and Crystal Bot feels underwhelming\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 📖Story\r\nEndless Dungeon's narrative centers on recruiting a team of shipwrecked heroes who are on a perilous quest to navigate the eerie corridors of an abandoned space station. Their goal is to safeguard a valuable crystal against ceaseless hordes of hostile creatures, all while attempting to reach the station's core. Whether you embark on this journey solo or with friends, Endless Dungeon offers two distinct experiences.\r\n## 🎨Graphics And Art Style\r\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous with its vibrant and finely detailed low-fi visuals. The game's world is brimming with detail, thanks to gorgeous lighting to highlight the space station’s both lighting and darkness. The developers have gone to great lengths to create a world that feels alive and thriving, despite its desolation. Even the presentation with its dialogues is done via cartoonish art style that fits perfectly with the tone of the game. The game has a unique approach to its dialogue by omitting fully voiced lines and instead opting for mixing text-based interactions with murmured voice lines.\r\nOverall, Endless Dungeon boasts a Space Western setting that captivates players with its ambiance, lighting, and a meticulously crafted soundtrack. The game takes you on a rhythmic journey, seamlessly transitioning between moments of calm planning and frenetic battles against incoming waves of foes. I definitely love the vibe of this game.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nEndless Dungeon's gameplay is a tapestry of various genres, seamlessly interwoven to create a multifaceted and engaging experience. The game features several key gameplay elements that work together harmoniously to create an ever-evolving and captivating adventure. The game hooks you right in from the very start, from its initial tutorial to its actual rogue-lite gameplay, you’d want to keep playing for more.\r\nRoguelike Exploration: At its core, Endless Dungeon presents a traditional roguelike experience. You explore room after room, uncovering unique challenges, enemies, and secrets that vary from run to run, ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same. When you die or the crystal bot explodes, you restart, but keep some persistent progress to bring in to new runs, eventually pushing further and further. Endless Dungeon keeps the gameplay fresh with its procedurally generated levels, so not every run is going to be the same.\r\nRTS-lite Elements: Real-time strategy elements are expertly blended into the gameplay. You have the ability to construct buildings strategically, position turrets, and manage resources on predetermined slots around the map. Buildings called generators will generate resources for every door you open, which functions as “turns”, and is used to construct more buildings or unlock upgrades. This aspect adds a layer of complexity, requiring thoughtful planning and resource allocation.\r\nTower Defense Mechanics: Of course, with the turret-building comes tower defense, the game incorporates classic tower defense mechanics, where building and positioning turrets is crucial for surviving enemy waves and defending key elements like generators, shields, and your crystal bot. Players must carefully choose turret locations and decide on upgrades, which significantly impact the success of their strategy.\r\nEscort Gameplay: Endless Dungeon introduces an escort mission dynamic, which feels very similar to Payload from Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch. Players are tasked with protecting the Crystal Bot. You must create a protective path throughout the space station and ensure the crystal bot's safety, especially when it tries to mine crystals or unlock new doors. In addition, you can command the crystal bot to follow you, and teleport to it at any time.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nEndless Dungeon is basically a twin-stick shooter when it comes to combat, you can activate your basic ability and ultimate ability, and pick up and switch between two different weapons. Each hero in the game possesses a distinct role and set of abilities, adding a tactical dimension to the combat. Real-time combat keeps players on their toes, making precise shooting and strategic decisions paramount for survival.\r\n## 💎 Resource\r\nManaging resources is a central component of the game. Balancing resources, including Science, Industry, and Food, is crucial. Decisions about allocating these resources affect your ability to face the challenges of each district. The game constantly demands risk assessment when deciding to building new structures, defenses, opening new doors and creating entry points. Personally, I found some success by prioritizing Industry, as I really love filling the map with turrets.\r\n## 🎮 Perfectly executed all at once\r\nThese diverse gameplay elements seamlessly merge into a cohesive and engaging experience. Players have the freedom to explore roguelike dungeons, employ RTS tactics, fend off enemy waves in a tower defense style, and engage in thrilling escort missions. The game's dynamic gameplay ensures that players remain captivated and entertained throughout their adventure.\r\nOverall, the gameplay offers a great deal of variety. It combines the simplicity of a roguelite, where you clear room after room, with RTS and tower defense elements involving the construction of buildings and turrets. The escort mission dynamic is also another nerve racking aspect that pressures players to be more careful and think outside their own lives. This amalgamation instills resource and risk management into all of the above aspects, ensuring that players are continually engaged with a never-ending variety throughout the expansive randomized levels.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nEndless Dungeon offers a robust progression system that rewards players with a sense of accomplishment and a drive to delve deeper into the game. Each death serves as a learning experience and an opportunity for gradual progress. The game provides rewards such as new information, district keystones to unlock additional areas, resources for upgrades, and the discovery of new heroes and questlines. Resource management is critical once egain, as players must strike a balance between investing in defense, character upgrades, and exploration.\r\n## 🎮🎮 Solo or Coop?\r\nThese exciting gameplay, are all playable in either Solo or multiplayer, which offers two distinct experiences. Solo play allows you to bring in one or two AI companions with you, and seamlessly switch between them at any point.  This solo experience rewards cerebral gameplay and strategic thinking, as you are all on your own, only slightly assisted by the AI. The command system is a little too basic for my liking, as it only features hold and follow commands. A more comprehensive command system would have been a great icing on the cake.\r\nMultiplayer gameplay, on the other hand, introduces a whole new level of excitement. Here, you collaborate with your squadmates, sharing resources, strategies, and the thrill of battling together just like any other twin stick coop game. You also share all rewards, including unlocking new heroes, enhancing the sense of camaraderie.\r\nMy only gripe about the multiplayer experience is the missed opportunity to include local co-op play. The addition of either shared or split-screen local co-op would have been a welcome intermediate option, bridging the gap between solo and online co-op play. Personally, I'm more of a singleplayer gamer, and my experience with the singleplayer mode has been absolutely amazing. I've always enjoyed having AI companions in my games, and this one gets a bonus point for including that.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game ran without any issues for me, aside from occasional micro stutters when loading new areas. The game is almost at locked 120fps on my i7-8700k RTX 3080 PC, and achieves a stable 60fps frame rate at medium settings on the Steam Deck. It is well optimized and the fluidity of the game really helps with its action-packed twin stick shooter nature.\r\nThe game supports both mouse and keyboard, as well as controllers in a twin-stick format. On gamepads, shooting benefits from a slight aim assist, which significantly aids in making the gameplay smoother without diminishing the challenge\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nEndless Dungeon is a masterful execution that blends various gaming genres to create a fun and addicting roguelite experience. The game's premise of defending a crystal in the ruins of an abandoned space station is brought to life through its gorgeous visuals and fluid performance, and it keeps players engaged and entertained with its ever-evolving and multifaceted challenges.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6456330) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Marvel’s Spider-Man 2\r\n9.0\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nAction\r\nGet\r\nSpider-Man 2 --- actually the third installment in the Marvel's Spider-Man series, swings onto the scene with high expectations and boy it delivers. Following the success of Marvel's Spider-Man and the enjoyable spin-off, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which is one of the first games I reviewed here on TapTap, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is not just another sequel but a progression of the series that builds upon the solid foundation laid by its predecessors.\r\nI reviewed here on TapTap\r\n## Pros\r\n- Balanced emotional storytelling with Peter, Miles and their supporting casts and villains\r\n- Seamless character switching between the two Spider-Men\r\n- Satisfying Spider-Man mechanics: Swinging and Combat\r\n- Engaging character progression: unique abilities and gadgets for both characters\r\n- A wide range of accessibility and visual options, from swing assists to 60FPS## Cons\r\n-Back are the boring unskippable non-superhero stealth missions that disrupt the fun\r\n-Totally a missed perfect opportunity for co-op play\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSpider-Man 2's narrative doesn't hold back, thrusting players into an action-packed intro that's nothing short of breathtaking. The story takes place in the same continuity as the previous games, and it's centered around Peter Parker and Miles Morales as they grapple with personal challenges while facing new and formidable threats. Additionally, the narrative delves into Peter's past, shedding light on his early days as Spider-Man, adding more depth to his character already established in the first game as a seasoned Spider-Man.\r\nOne of the central antagonists in this installment is Kraven the Hunter, who leads a private militia and turns New York City into a hunting ground for super-powered individuals.  The other major threat comes in the form of the Venom symbiote, which bonds itself to Peter Parker and exerts a dark influence on him. This dynamic adds an intriguing layer to the story, putting Peter's personal relationships at risk and intensifying the struggle against a powerful extraterrestrial force that we are all familiar with.\r\nThe game's narrative approach is masterful in maintaining a balance between the superhero personas of Peter and Miles and their personal lives. Players get a deeper look at their characters as friends, partners, a son, mentor, and student. It's not always about being Spider-Man; sometimes, it's about being Peter or Miles.  The game dives into each character hero; supporting cast, or villain and takes time to show their human side. This human element is one of the game's strengths and contributes to a richer storytelling experience.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Direction\r\nGraphically, Spider-Man 2 maintains the high standards set by its predecessors. The visuals strike a balance between realism and comic-book stylized character designs. New York City and its added new surrounding boroughs are finely detailed, providing an impressive backdrop for the game's open world setting. Swinging through the towering skyscrapers is an exhilarating experience, and the day-night cycle adds depth and atmosphere to the city.\r\nCharacter models are intricately designed and detailed, with both Peter and Miles moving with incredible fluidity and realism. This attention to detail extends to the various Spider-Man suits and their unique designs. The combat animations, web-swinging mechanics, and even simple actions like character stopping from a running motion are executed beautifully.\r\nThe game supports raytracing on the PlayStation 5, enhancing the visual experience with improved lighting and reflections, although honestly, its really not that noticeable and not big of a deal. A big deal however, is the addition of a performance mode that allows for a smooth 60FPS experience. A literal game-changer, making the transition from the previous PlayStation generation to the new one a leap forward in performance and visual fidelity.  It is for this reason that I shamefully never played the first two Spider-Man games on the PS4, and waited until it is on the PC/PS5 to be able to play at 60FPS. Luckily with Spider-Man 2, the game now supports 60FPS right out of the bat.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay – if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but maybe improve it\r\nThe introduction sequence is immediately action-packed and doesn't skip a beat. I literally got goosebumps while playing through the initial set piece, which could even pass as a climax in other games. It also clearly showcases the power of the PS5's SSD with the amount of city panning and fast traversal it seamlessly executes.\r\nGameplay in Spider-Man 2 sticks to the tried-and-true formula established by the first two games, with several subtle improvements and enhancements. At its core, the game is about embracing the dual roles of Peter Parker and Miles Morales as Spider-Men.\r\nThe game is essentially a case of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' which is evident because the first game is already a masterpiece. While some animations remain the same or are just slightly tweaked, this is understandable since a character wouldn't just change his entire moveset just because he’s in a new game. However, there are indeed new animations added for various actions, including swinging, fighting, and finishing moves. Both Spider-Man characters have their own distinct movesets and have been improved upon compared to the first two games.\r\nThe option to seamlessly switch between Peter and Miles at almost any point in free roam —- similar to the style of GTA V’s multiple characters —- basically doubles the gameplay variety, as both characters offer unique abilities and gadgets. Add to that the symbiote suit for Peter that introduces a dark twist to his moveset, so might as well make that triple variety.\r\nThe implementation of having two Spider-Men characters in the game is exceptionally well done. You can seamlessly switch between Peter and Miles at almost any point while in free roam. Loading is extremely fast, as evidenced by the 1 second fast travel. It loads in just about one second, regardless of your location on the map or where you choose to fast travel to. It's nearly instantaneous. Additionally, you can occasionally encounter the other Spider-Man on the map fighting crimes and provide assistance.\r\n## 🕸Who needs a 1 second fast travel when the swinging is this good?\r\nThe web-swinging mechanics remain as thrilling as ever, allowing players to traverse the city with agility and grace. The addition of Web Wings to glide throughout the air on both Peter and Miles' suits is a game-changer, enabling them to glide across the city especially across the river to transfer between islands. The wind tunnels and environmental elements add depth to traversal, making it an essential part of the experience. Players can also surf temporarily across the surface of the river if they have enough momentum, ensuring that the traversal experience is as smooth and accessible as it can be despite the huge gaps between islands.\r\n## 📟 New abilities and gadgets\r\nThe game levels the playing field for Peter and Miles by introducing new abilities and gadgets for Peter, which balance with Miles' electricity and invisibility powers. In this sequel, many of Peter's previous gadgets have been replaced, leaving him with just four; however, the game compensates by providing four abilities simultaneously. While each Spider-Man can equip only four powers at a time, they will unlock at least eight (two choices per slot) during the campaign. Peter wields both his mechanic spider-arms and the symbiote suit, while Miles relies on his venom powers. Additionally, both Spider-Men have their own sets of costumes to unlock and wear, and each costume offers various color variants, significantly expanding the roster.\r\nThe wide range of unlockable abilities and mods for the web-shooters offers a sense of personalization. Players can experiment with different playstyles, from stealthy takedowns to all-out brawls, depending on their preferred abilities and gadgets.\r\n## 🥷The boring parts\r\nI was never really a fan of the first game's minor side missions and puzzle segments, especially those that involve on-rails stealth and non-suit gameplay, and they're back here once again. For example, playing as a young Peter Parker sneaking his way into his school in a flashback scene or the stealth segments involving MJ. While these sequences have been slightly improved with faster mobility, they still bring back traumatic memories of mediocrity in an otherwise masterpiece title. They do provide a nice break from the action-packed gameplay of being Spider-Man and add some gameplay variety, but I feel that they disrupt the pacing and overall enjoyment too much. Fortunately, there is some minor relief as you can choose to skip at least the puzzle segments once again if you prefer.\r\n## ♿️Accessibility\r\nMany accessibility options are available, and there are even new optional gameplay features, such as the ability to turn off Swing Assist, which provides a challenging swinging experience akin to the classic Spider-Man 2 game for the PS2. The game also offers an option to slow down gameplay down to 30%, resulting in some rather cool and cinematic moments. In the first game, we had to use our photo camera to manipulate the game into slowing down time.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nIn the combat department, Spider-Man 2 builds on the existing Arkham-inspired system with refinements and new elements. Both Peter and Miles can now parry physical attacks, a welcome addition instead of purely relying on dodges. As a result, on the enemy’s side, there are now certain enemies that cannot be dodged. The gadgets have received upgrades, including mods for web-shooters that allow for new strategic possibilities. For example, players can cast a Web Line across pillars for added footing during stealth sequences, which is particularly useful for performing Stealth Takedowns on multiple enemies.\r\nEach Spider-Man has their own skill tree as well as a shared general skill tree usable for both, which includes unlockable abilities tied to their experience level. Both Spider-Men exhibit fluid and acrobatic movements, which are visually impressive and satisfying to execute. The addition of the Venom symbiote for Peter brings unique abilities and a darker edge to his fighting style, adding a layer of complexity to battles. The combat system maintains the fun and fluid nature that fans of the series have come to love while introducing meaningful improvements that keep battles fresh and exciting. If you’re an expert combatant in the first two games, then this game will feel very similar.\r\n## 🕷🕷Be Greater. Together… the greatest missed opportunity of this game.\r\nHowever, given that the Spider-Men angle is executed very well, I can't help but think that this represents a missed opportunity to introduce optional co-op play to the game, even if it's in a limited capacity, as it wouldn't work for story missions. Even for activities like free roam or an entirely separate co-op campaign, similar to games like Far Cry 4, this could have elevated the game to new heights. Imagine one player assuming the role of Peter and another as Miles, collaborating in a cooperative manner. This is certainly something that has never been done before in a Spider-Man game and is entirely feasible in today's console generation. It's one of those rare instances where it would have not only made sense but also aligned perfectly with the game's theme of 'Be Greater. Together.' — Maybe in a future spin-off?\r\nConclusion\r\nSpider-Man 2 swings into action with the weight of high expectations and delivers an experience that doesn't disappoint. The game's story and premise offer a captivating experience that balances the superhero personas of Peter Parker and Miles Morales with their personal lives, providing a richer and more emotionally resonant experience. As said earlier, Spider-Man 2 is not just a sequel; it's a continuation of a beloved series that builds upon its predecessors in all the right ways. It's a game that respects the legacy of the character while introducing new elements to keep players engaged and entertained. Even at $70 and the potential cost of buying a new console, this game is undoubtedly worth swinging into your gaming collection.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6459949) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dancing Duelists\r\n8.5\r\nStrategy\r\nRelaxing\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nIn Dancing Duelists, you step into the shoes of one of ten charming, cartoonish characters, each radiating a unique silly vibe. The goal is straightforward - win seven battles to claim the title of the ultimate Dance Duelist. However, be wary of accumulating three losses, as that spells your way out of the competition. It's also a roguelike in the truest sense, with every defeat resetting your progress.\r\nThe game was made in just three weeks, as part of the developers decision to consider switching to Godot Engine from Unity, in light of recent controversial events surrounding royalty payments with Unity developers.\r\n## 🕺The Dance-Offs\r\nThe battles themselves are not something you control directly; instead, they play out automatically. The 'dance-off' theme is primarily aesthetic, with an energetic and jazzy soundtrack adding to the game's groove. Unfortunately, if you were expecting rhythm game elements, you might be disappointed, there are actually no real dance or rhythm game elements involved. The focus here is squarely on deckbuilding and strategic choices. Overall, the game is decent for an autobattler dance-off created in just three weeks.\r\n## 🃏 Deckbuilding and Strategy\r\nThere is no real tangible gameplay aside from the deckbuilding, but the deck building is a bit limited too and requires an initial winning momentum to add cards to your deck and optimize it. You cannot change your initial deck of three cards, aside from choosing characters, each of which has its own starting set of cards. However, you can't view them outright while on the character selection screen and must choose blindly.  You must learn each character's strengths and weaknesses through trial and error, or taking a screenshot of each and viewing them manually.\r\nThe cards themselves introduce variety to the gameplay. They come with different effects such as gaining HP, dealing damage, and inflicting status effects like Dizziness. Every other battle presents you with the opportunity to acquire trinkets, which grant unique abilities to further optimize your deck, such as gaining HP every X amount of turns, Playing 1 extra card on the first turn, or dealing damage whenever you get Dizzy.\r\n## ⏰️Beatable within 10 minutes\r\nWhen you play long enough, you’ll find that the game is not well balanced due to its reliance on randomness. You can either find yourself snowballing on a winning streak or facing defeat just as quickly. Understandably, for a project completed in just three weeks, I expect not much thought has been put into this game with regarding to balancing it. However, when you're winning, the game is undeniably fun. The game is really short, and you can beat it in just 10 minutes, even in your first playthrough.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDancing Duelists is a decent mini-game as Mega Crit’s practice in using the Godot Engine. This deckbuilding autobattler dance-off, despite its brevity, manages to deliver an enjoyable experience with catchy music and silly character designs. While it may not offer an extensive gameplay experience, it's a worthy diversion available for everyone to check out. Dancing Duelists is available for free on itch.io.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6460394) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Fresh from its recent update last month, \"Fogbound Dream\", Snowbreak: Containment Zone is about to get even fresher, quite literally, with its new content update called \"Verdurous Holiday\".\r\nThis tropical-themed update promises a refreshing change of scenery and gameplay, introducing Yallu Island, a mesmerizing beach paradise that will challenge players with mysteries and adventures.\r\n## 🌴A Tropical Escape\r\nThe new expansion transports players to the pristine shores of Yallu Island, a picturesque oasis nestled in the West Patra Sea. With its tranquil beaches, lush landscapes, and inviting azure waters, it's no wonder Yallu Island has become a world-famous vacationers' paradise, often referred to as the \"Verdure Star of the Sea.\" I didn't know what Verdurous meant before this announcement, but now I know it means green and lush, and this update surely is.\r\nBut this vacation is not your typical relaxing getaway.

The island's pristine beauty is contrasted by its enigmatic secrets.\r\n## 👙New Content and Features\r\nVerdurous Holiday introduces a range of new content and features, including outfits and rewards such as Yao Winter Solstice’s “Sparkling Swell” and Enya Murphy’s “Sultry Sunshine.”  The outfits look sexy, amazing, and surely a treat for fans of the game.\r\nThe highlight of this expansion is the introduction of a new character, Mauxir - Shadow Ka. Mauxir wields a tactical exosuit equipped with a tactical robot module. The connection between Mauxir and the robot, \"Kebechet,\" grants them the power to transform, offering unique combat capabilities. Mauxir can swing \"Kebechet - Sacrifice\" at enemies, causing it to explode upon impact and deal damage. Judging from the trailer and subsequent reveals, the character is indeed interesting.\r\n## 🎣New Activities?\r\n## \"Fogbound Dream\"\r\n## \"Verdurous Holiday\"\r\nWhile exact details on all the activities included in the expansion remain unknown, the official trailer for Verdurous Holiday provided a sneak peek into what players can expect. Island exploration seems to be a significant focus, with breathtaking vistas awaiting discovery. The trailer also teased fishing as one of the confirmed activities, as well as a board game like mini-game.\r\n## 🎉Party Board game?\r\n## \"Goddrush Pam\" is a gold-grabbing party game jointly developed by Ramses Group and Fujiwara Entertainment. Players will have the opportunity to compete against others in this entertaining board game mode, offering a unique twist to the Snowbreak experience.\r\nSeabound Warfare, set on the island, will offer traditional Snowbreak shooter gameplay. Players will undertake a series of trials across five islands, each promising valuable pearls as rewards. Teumessian, a notable character from the Snowbreak universe, is set to make an appearance in this action-packed mode.\r\nVerdurous Holiday is set to release on November 2, 2023 and expect more details to come soon as we approach the date. Stay tuned for more updates, and prepare to escape to Yallu Island's Verdurous Holiday and have some much needed refreshment.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6460128) Originally posted on TapTap.",

(which I'm not going to spoil, the gameplay shown above is a random snippet taken from my playthrough). Immediately, It also clearly showcases the power of the PS5's SSD with the amount of city panning and fast traversal it seamlessly executes.\r\nThe story takes place in the same continuity as the previous games, and it's centered around Peter Parker and Miles Morales as they grapple with personal challenges while facing new and formidable threats.\r\nGraphically, Spider-Man 2 maintains the high standards set by its predecessors. The visuals strike a balance between realism and comic-book stylized character designs. New York City and its added new surrounding boroughs are finely detailed, providing an impressive backdrop for the game's open world setting. Swinging through the towering skyscrapers is an exhilarating experience, and the day-night cycle adds depth and atmosphere to the city.\r\nThe game introduces new traversal and combat abilities, including web-based gadgets and unlockable suits that enhance the Spider-Men's playstyles. Notably, the game strives for a balanced playing field between Peter and Miles, introducing new abilities for Peter to match Miles' electric powers and invisibility. Both Spider-Men boast a wide range of costumes with various color variants, which expands the roster considerably.\r\nOverall, Spider-Man 2 appears to be building on the strengths of its predecessors, delivering an exciting and visually impressive experience, with a deeper narrative that explores the personal lives of its beloved characters. The game keeps the essence of what made the series great while introducing subtle improvements and offering various options for players to customize their experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6459948) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "HOT WHEELS UNLEASHED™ 2 - Turbocharged\r\n8.3\r\nRacing\r\nSimulation\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged, the sequel to the 2021 original, comes charging onto the scene with high-octane racing and the beloved charm of Hot Wheels. Although the game's popularity pales in comparison to giants like Forza or Gran Turismo, The original game — Hot Wheels Unleashed — was a lowkey good racing game and had a moderate amount of success, and this game offers a similar but enhanced experience compared to its predecessor. While it doesn't introduce groundbreaking changes, it refines and expands upon the elements that made the first game enjoyable.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Decent vehicle handling and controls\r\n- Introduction of new vehicle types and classes\r\n- Immersive graphics that resemble real Hot Wheels toys instead of actual cars\r\n- Expansive Track Builder to create custom tracks\r\n- New challenging ways to race, on and off track## Cons\r\n-Story is forgettable\r\n-Progression system is not that rewarding\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nHot Wheels Unleashed 2 adds a touch of narrative to the series, setting the stage with a story about massive monsters invading the city. This time, the heroes combat these creatures by racing Hot Wheels cars, and the story is delivered through short cutscenes every now and then in between races. The main heroes and the storyline are presented with a comic book or cartoon style of tone, with over the top dialogues and humor that goes along with the cartoonish theme.\r\nHonestly, the story is forgettable, literally. After a very short cutscene, you get to play multiple races, these races along are pretty much disconnected with how the story plays out. No dialogue during races, or something to glue the narrative together. It feels like I’m watching a separate unrelated cartoon and then taking a break to play a different game altogether. If you only care for the races, then you aren’t really losing much in terms of the narrative.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe game continues to impress with its graphics and attention to detail. The Hot Wheels cars are incredibly faithful to their real-world counterparts. The graphics genuinely resemble toy cars with all their imperfections and die-cast aesthetics, and they are clearly not intended to mimic or look like real-life or full-sized vehicles. Rotating them in the menus or in the photo mode reveals intricate details that make them look like real toys.\r\nThe game features various life-sized environments where everyday objects like stools and skateboards are blown up to gigantic proportions. The lighting and reflections, particularly in locations like the Arcade and Gas Station, are decent looking and can pass as current gen visuals.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe heart of Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 lies in its high-speed, arcade-style racing, with little toys around a huge track set in a normal sized place, like a backyard, or a museum. This game improves upon the second by introduction of different vehicle classes. Each class, such as Rocket, Balanced, Swift, Drifter, Off-Road, and Heavy Duty, has its own unique characteristics, offering variety in terms of control and handling. Drifters excel in drifting, while Off-Road excels in going off course, It’s pretty much self explanatory. You can select any class for each race, so it’s still a good ‘ol free for all. The game also now features ATV’s and Motorcycles, which are welcome additions to the overall vehicle roster.  Although, much like the toys they are, it's always a bit disorienting to see these small riderless ATVs and bikes racing around the track.\r\nThere are also new abilities like jumping and side dashes for bumping into enemies. These abilities require boost and are essential for successfully navigating the tracks because there are now gaps and obstacles to jump over or evade. You can't simply abuse the boost meter to constantly propel yourself anymore. You'll need to pay close attention. If you run out of boost before a significant gap, you'll fall and have to reset. Fortunately, resetting replenishes you with the necessary amount of boost to make it through.\r\nObstacles in the game have been improved as well and come in various forms. Some can be knocked away, some can be totally avoided, some need to be jumped on. Additionally, there are track hazards, such as a spider spitting webs over the track to stop vehicles or a shark closing its mouth over the track, which adds a bit of flavor to races.\r\nThe racing environment features five distinct locations, including the Gas Station, Mini-Golf, Museum, Arcade, and Backyard. These environments are not just visually different but also offer unique obstacles that become part of the race track. It's especially noticeable in the Waypoints races, where players navigate through the environment rather than on a traditional track, which felt similar to one of my favorite toy racing games growing up: Re-Volt.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nHot Wheels Unleashed 2 offers a wider variety of Hot Wheels cars to collect and race with. With the introduction of vehicle classes, each type of Hot Wheels vehicle feels distinct, providing excitement when unlocking new ones. The vehicles can be upgraded, increasing their overall level and providing a boost to stats. Additionally, there are perks that can be unlocked and equipped, although they often come with trade-offs, allowing players to customize their vehicles to suit their playstyle.\r\nHowever, the progression system overall is a bit of a downgrade compared to the original. Challenges, which are meant to offer rewards, often provide profile customization options (which are almost entirely useless) instead the actual titular Hot Wheels cars.\r\n## 🛣Track Builder\r\nOne of the best features of the Hot Wheels Unleashed series is its track builder, which truly emphasizes the toy-like nature of the game. With this tool, players can create custom tracks using a user-friendly editor, and it's back and better than ever. It no longer requires players to unlock track parts, granting them the freedom to create tracks without unnecessary restrictions.\r\nThe track builder includes all the track pieces used in the campaign races, making it versatile and unrestricted. Building and racing on community tracks can be a highly enjoyable experience. Finding community tracks is made easy with recommended tabs, filters for tags, environments, and track names. The sharing system is straightforward and offers enough filtering options to quickly discover the desired type of track.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game ran smoothly on a lock 120fps 1080p on my 8700k RTX 3080 PC, and I had no problems in running the game. It fully supports split-screen coop, controllers and rumble, and features both DLSS and FSR, although I found it weird not being able to use DLSS on a fullscreen windowed mode, and I had to use FSR on my NVIDIA GPU.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged builds upon the success of its predecessor with enhanced gameplay, diverse vehicle classes, and an expanded track builder. While the story is forgettable and feels disjointed from the actual gameplay, it’s small part in the game doesn't detract from the overall racing experience. It may not reinvent the wheel and can feel like the same game at times, but it certainly gives it a turbocharged spin worthy of being called a sequel, delivering a great arcade Hot Wheels racing experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6463800) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is continuation of the original game with some noticeable improvements, especially in the gameplay and content.\r\nThe game tries to tell a story about massive monsters invading the city, which adds a narrative layer to the racing events. I find the story a bit disjointed though with the actual gameplay and racing parts of the game, which is probably 99% of the game, fortunately.\r\nContent wise, there are a lot of subtle gameplay enhancements. New vehicle types and classes such as Off-Road and Drifters, or ATVs and Bikes are added. There is also a new type of race called Waypoint, which is completely offtrack and is set throughout the five environments in the game: Gas Station, Mini-Golf, Museum, Arcade, and Backyard.\r\nGameplay wise, two new abilities are added to spice up the action: Jumping and sideways dashes. Jumping to go over track gaps, obstacles, and enemies, and dashes for better maneuverability and  to bump enemies to the sides.\r\nOverall, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged feels very similar to it's predecessor. With similar graphics and arcade racer feel to it. Just with enough improvements that it gets a pass from being a full-on sequel instead of being an expansion, DLC, or a mere update. If you love the first game, then this is no question a must buy for you. If you're just looking for a Hot Wheels racing experience on a video game, then look no further, no need to play the first.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6463742) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Classic 2D platformer Mario is back, and it's probably the best Super Mario game to date.\r\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder is not just a game; it's an experience that redefines what we can expect from a 2D platformer. It seamlessly blends the classic Mario gameplay with a heavy dose of whimsy and unpredictability.\r\nThe level design is simply wonderful and lives up to its name, the introduction of Wonder Seeds that you need to gather throughout the six worlds to defeat Castle bowser carries the whole game with its relentless whimsical surprises that keeps players engaged throughout their adventure.\r\nThe co-op experience is also a blast. You can play up to four players locally and online, and you and your friends can basically conquer the whole game that way. It's easier, more fun, and chaotic, which is perfect for the game's chaotic tone.\r\nFor those who have been following Mario's journey since the 1980s, Wonder is a joyful reminder of the series' enduring magic. For newcomers, it's an excellent entry point that embraces the spirit of the franchise while offering something refreshingly new. Nintendo has successfully combined the traditional and the innovative, making Wonder a must-play title for fans of all ages.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6465657) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder\r\n9.3\r\nPlatformer\r\nAction\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nDeveloped and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch, Super Mario Bros. Wonder marks the return of traditional side-scrolling Mario after a decade-long hiatus. The game introduces us to the Flower Kingdom, a vibrant and fantastical world neighboring Mushroom Kingdom that's filled with surprises and extraordinary gameplay mechanics.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Innovative new gameplay mechanics\r\n- Accessible difficulty for all ages\r\n- Creative level design and wonderful gimmicks that keeps on surprising\r\n- Wonderfully beautiful; colorful and joyful looking\r\n- Fun local co-op play with its own mechanics## Cons\r\n-No cons\r\n## ⭐️Score: 10/10\r\n## 📖Story\r\nThe story of Wonder serves as a delightful backdrop for the game’s sidescrolling adventures. Bowser's taken an unusual turn by turning himself into a giant evil castle, and it's up to Mario and his friends to set things right. The premise might sound bizarre, but that's where the charm of this game truly shines. It's not about complex narratives but rather a platform for unbridled creativity.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe game's art style is wonderfully beautiful; colorful and joyful looking, intricately animated with a strong attention to detail. While adhering to the 2D platformer tradition, Wonder adds a dash of surrealism to the mix. The level design is a visual masterpiece, with environments that can transform into something utterly unexpected thanks to the Wonder Seeds, resulting in dynamic art styles that's both nostalgic and refreshingly new. The dialogues aren't fully voice-acted, but for the voiced lines, the acting is wonderfully done, even with the inclusion of new voice actors, especially for Mario.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is nothing short of a delightful odyssey. At its core, it adheres to the classic Mario formula – running from left to right, jumping over pits, smashing bricks, stomping on Goombas, and collecting those precious coins. Players can play as any of the eight characters aside from Mario: Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Toad, Toadette, Nabbit and Yoshi.\r\nWhat sets \"Wonder\" apart and lives up to its name is its introduction of Wonder Seeds, the whimsical game-changers that redefine the Mario experience. With these seeds, you can never quite predict what's coming next. They invite players to experiment, adapt, and, most importantly, have fun.\r\nThe game's innovation lies in embracing chaos. When you encounter a Wonder Seed, the world transforms into a canvas of surprise and wonder. One moment, you're swimming through water; the next, you're evading falling pipes or being chased by bubbles to float you upwards in the air. At first I thought Mario’s fixation on mushrooms have gotten into him and it’s finally a gameplay element, but it’s actually the Wonder Seed’s doing. The unpredictability and variety introduced by these seeds keep players engaged and curious, like kids exploring a toy store. It’s really like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\r\nWhile the game introduces these dynamic changes, it doesn't lose its fundamentals. You still have those satisfying – perhaps frustrating — moments of precision platforming and timely jumps. It's a balancing act between the classic Mario mechanics and the refreshing infusion of Wonder Seeds, making it accessible for all types of players.\r\n## 🕹Accessibility\r\nOf course, it’s probably the most accessible Mario to date, as it welcomes players of all skill levels, ensuring that no one feels left behind. For starters, there is no time limit. Players have the freedom to tailor their experience to their liking. If you're new to Mario or just want a more relaxed playthrough, you can choose characters like Yoshi and Nabbit, who essentially serve as an easy mode because he does not die from damage at the expense of not having to use power-ups, but he does die from falling into hazards, so it’s not a full-on invulnerability mode. These characters can also jump farther, providing a comfortable experience. When me and my partner played the game, and had some difficulties in the harder levels, we chose to play Yoshi and it was immediately a more fun experience.\r\n## 🎲Multiplayer\r\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder features local multiplayer support for up to four players, allowing friends and family to join in the platforming fun. The lives mechanic is changed a bit compared to solo play, allowing players to revive their friends one last chance before dying. Additionally, the game introduces characters that players can ride on alongside each other, further promoting collaboration and shared exploration. The game is made easier by playing multiplayer, but this aspect basically doubles, triples, and quadruples the fun for me. Whether you're cooperating or competing, the multiplayer mode enhances the overall experience, making it a fantastic choice for group gaming sessions.\r\n## 🌷Level Design\r\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder takes players on a delightful journey through the Flower Kingdom, offering a total of six distinct worlds to explore, each with its unique charm and challenges: Pipe-Rock Plateau, Fluff-Puff Peaks, Shining Falls, Sunbaked Desert, Fungi Mines, and Deep Magma Bog. It’s weirdly named yes, but still self-explanatory as far as describing the general aesthetic of these worlds. There is also The Petal Isles that play a vital role in connecting the six main worlds, although you'll need to complete several stages within it before unlocking the next world.\r\nEach world and the stage in them is a meticulously crafted work of art, blending aesthetics with playability, while adhering to the 2D platformer Mario we all recognize and love. These stages are more than just challenges; they're experiences.  The levels are diverse and filled with imaginative design elements.\r\nThe game's multi-layered approach to levels adds depth to the exploration. You're not just moving left and right; you're also venturing into the background, discovering hidden secrets, and unlocking new possibilities. Enemies behave in surprising ways, adding an extra layer of challenge. It's a marriage of creativity and player engagement. In one encounter, I kicked a turtle towards an enemy, only for that enemy to kick back that turtle to me and surprise me. In another, I saw Wonder Seed locked behind bricks that I can’t destroy, only to find out that you had to lure a type of enemy towards it (instead of killing it) to be able to destroy it and gain access to it.\r\nIn the overworld, the levels's star ratings for difficulty provide transparency, helping you gauge what to expect in each level. It's an approach that ensures players can find the right balance between challenge and enjoyment.\r\n## ⏫Progression, Power-Ups, and Abilities\r\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder introduces a delightful array of new power-ups. These include the ability to transform into an elephant to break through obstacles, creating bubbles that capture enemies while serving as temporary platforms, and the unique Wonder Flower that triggers unpredictable effects like pipes coming to life or entire hordes of enemies spawning.\r\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder also introduces badges, a system that grants special abilities which are different from power-ups. You can unlock and equip badges as you progress, granting everything from gliding and wall jumps to playful abilities like a Piranha Plant grappling hook. These badges are a dynamic way to customize your gameplay based on your preferences or the specific challenges of a level.\r\nThe game's ability to skip challenging levels without getting stuck is a welcome feature, making it less frustrating for those who might face difficulty spikes. This versatility in progression keeps the game inclusive and enjoyable for a wide range of players.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder is a delightful, whimsical, and mind-bending experience that pushes the boundaries of what a 2D platformer can be, both for you and your friends. In a gaming world filled with endless quests and artificial rewards, Wonder stands out for offering a different kind of satisfaction – the joy of playing itself. It's likely Nintendo's swan song for the Switch, and they're certainly leaving with a masterpiece of a bang, before the potential launch of their new console next year.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6465693) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "8.1\r\nStrategy\r\nRPG\r\n## ✨Overview\r\n## Pros\r\n- Charming chibi-style visuals\r\n- Strategic layer in combat instead of a full-auto battler\r\n- Diverse array of hero and units types\r\n## Cons\r\n- Story is forgettable and not interesting\r\n- Weak combat AI for your army\r\n- Grindy progression from the start\r\n- Many of the gameplay modes are locked further in\r\n## ⭐️Score: 5/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game's premise revolves around the players' role as Lords tasked with leading their Heroes and Legions to restore Camelot, which is ravaged by the Time Holes that players will need to close. It sets the stage for epic battles and strategic conquests, but honestly it’s not that interesting. I find myself not caring about the story especially that the presentation is underwhelming, from the pretty static visuals to the text-based dialogue without voice acting, its likely that you’ll skip these long and drawn out cutscenes to get right into the action.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\n## 🗺️The World\r\nThe world design is notably Chibi-based too, with mini-castles, structures, and units battling on hexagonal tile-based maps. The in-game world is replete with diverse regions, each uniquely designed with its own distinctive style and culture, contributing to the immersive experience of governing and developing reclaimed lands.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nKnightcore offers a distinctive blend of tower offense and real-time strategy, which sets it apart from many idle or autobattler mobile games. Players are tasked with balancing the deployment of their units, and they must decide when and where to deploy various heroes and army types for maximum impact. The game provides players with a time limit of 99 seconds for battles, while points are given to you over time to use and to deploy units. The 99-second time limit forces quick thinking and decisions, making every moment of the battle count. I've had many moments where I barely beat levels with only a few seconds left, adding tension and excitement to matches.\r\nWhile battles are automated, players maintain a degree of control over unit deployment and prioritizing targets, which adds a layer of strategic depth that is often missing in other mobile games. This control gives you the ability to fine-tune your approach and adapt to the battlefield as needed. Players can also activate the ability of their units once the meter fills up, but they can opt to have it automated.\r\nThe world has multiple regions to progress into, and every region has multiple areas with 3 levels to beat. You need to meet the required conditions to achieve a 3-star rating for each level. If you successfully beat all three levels in an area, it unlocks a boss fight level before you can proceed to the next. After that, you move on to the next region and the next map to progress in the game.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe actual combat itself is also automated, it incorporates a Rock-paper-scissors Weakness system, where unit types counter each other.  There is also an option to sped up the battles, auto-deploy units, and skip cinematics. However, it's worth noting that boss fights cannot be automated, demanding players' full attention.\r\nAs far as autobattles go, the AI needs improvement in how it controls units. I've had an experience where, even though I exceed the power level recommended by the game, auto-generated troops still barely manage to win. Additionally, I've encountered some soldier units getting stuck and standing around doing nothing during combat.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression in Knightcore has both positive and negative aspects. On the plus side, the game offers diverse army types with specialized abilities, encouraging players to experiment with various compositions to create formidable Legions. Players can also build upon their reclaimed lands to get some passive resource bonuses. However, I found the progression very grindy even in the early stages, and energy/stamina limitations can become a constant hindrance, requiring patience or in-app purchases to keep going.\r\nAt my first hour of play, I’ve already hit a soft wall that need me to utilize the game’s gacha mechanics to improve my characters. At my second hour of play, I already ran out of energy/stamina to use to keep going and must buy from the store using gems or wait. The game has other features such as PVP or Guild, but it’s locked deep further in the progression that it’s hard to keep invested in. There’s only so much the initial gameplay loop can do, and it gets repetitive, grindy, and monotonous without a constant stream of interesting gameplay elements.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nKnightcore follows the typical gacha-style monetization model commonly seen in mobile games. The game has gacha mechanics that can be used to improve your characters. While gacha systems can be enjoyable for some players, it's essential to approach them with caution to avoid overspending. In addition, the game includes options for in-app purchases related to stamina or unit upgrades, which is necessary for continuous gameplay and to overcome the power level requirements of levels.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI’ve also encountered some minor bugs, especially when you are trying to do other stuff while the tutorial is trying to point you in another direction. It sometimes bugs out and locks you out of the game unless you restart. The UI navigation could use some more work too; transitions are slow, it’s quite confusing to navigate, and I feel like there are too many steps to do anything.\r\nIn terms of performance, it isn't the most fluid game I've experienced, but the game runs decently. One minor quirk I find weird is that the loading screen uses a 16:9 aspect ratio with borders instead of utilizing the full screen of my phone. There are no extensive graphics settings; the game features only one where you can choose between performance, balanced, and efficiency.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6470471) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "BATTLE CRUSH\r\n7.1\r\nAction\r\nMultiplayer\r\nTest\r\nBattle Crush (Beta), is an upcoming game that boldly combines the intense battle royale format with the strategic depth of a MOBA in a bite sized manner. Developed by NCOSFT, this multiplayer action game seeks to carve its own niche by combining two genres. It is coming for Android, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam), with an ongoing Closed Beta Test from Oct 23 to Oct 30. It will feature full cross-play support between these platforms.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nBattle Crush plunges players into an arena filled with Calixers, mythological figures personally chosen by the gods. These heroes range from Gods like Hades and Hercules, Myths like Medusa, or Legends like King Arthur and Lancelot. Their mission? To stand as the last warrior in the arena. If this sounds like a typical battle royale setup, you're on the right track. However, Battle Crush brings its own flavor to the mix.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe graphics are simple but striking, adopting a stylized hand-painted aesthetic. The visuals are characterized by their cartoony and soft appearance, which adds a lighthearted and somewhat casual tone to the game.\r\nThe art style isn't overly complex, but it works perfectly for Battle Crush. The characters and in-game assets are charming, and the effects, especially during combat, are over-the-top and flashy\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe royale battlefield arena can host up to 30 combatants in solo or team-based matches, every few seconds, the arena shrinks ever so smaller as the floor outside the zone collapses, leaving no room for passive gameplay. Rounds are kept brief, clocking in at a maximum of 8 minutes. Players must adapt to the constantly changing battleground, avoiding the collapsing terrain while fending off opponents from all sides.\r\nThe game, although straightforward, provides a high-octane gaming experience with a strong competitive element under a casual tone. It's a formula that's tried and true, but Battle Crush adds its own unique mechanics and charm to make it stand out.\r\n## ⚔️MOBA + Battle Royale?\r\nAt its core, Battle Crush is a fusion of battle royale and MOBA elements, and the result is a dynamic and strategic gaming experience. The gameplay is focused on quick rounds, strategic choices, and action-packed battles.\r\nThe game offers various character choices known as Calixers, each with its own unique abilities and playstyle. This character variety is reminiscent of MOBAs, where characters fulfill different roles, including support, melee damage, tank, ranged attacks, and more. It's a clever way to blend MOBA character depth with the competitive nature of battle royale.\r\nAs a genre we’re all familiar with, The gameplay dynamics are centered around a constantly shrinking battlefield. Although this feels like another light take on Battle Royale, as players just pin their starting positions on a map divided into nine areas, leading to a quick start phase. During this phase, players can see other players' starting positions, and have one last chance to quickly switch to any nearby location. The round begins, and over time, the map starts to shrink as the playable zone collapses. Players caught outside the zone will fall to their death, discouraging camping outside and relying on healing to get by.\r\nLooting is also part of Battle Crush. Players can find weapons, armor, and healing items scattered around the field, and everything is automatically picked up and equipped. This streamlined approach keeps the pace fast and the focus on combat.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nWhile the controls are simple, the combat can be quite complex. Players can combine five types of skills, including Light Attacks (quick moves and combos), Heavy Attacks (powerful blows that knock enemies back), and Dodge Attacks (quick counters). Additionally, Ultimate Attacks become available as players fill their meters from attacking, allowing them to unleash powerful attacks that deal massive damage and knockback. This variety in combat skills adds depth to the gameplay.\r\nAll attacks and abilities, along with dodge and swimming in water areas, consume stamina. Managing stamina effectively is essential for success. Players must strike a balance between offense and defense to avoid running out of stamina or being too passive.\r\nAnother interesting twist is the way player elimination works. Depleting an enemy's HP doesn't outright kill them; it leaves them groggy with a silver health bar that must be depleted to finish them off. Players can also revive themselves by letting the timer pass without dying. Teammates can collect their souls and revive them at randomly appearing Revive Statues throughout the map. Knockback effects can also be used strategically to bypass an enemy's health bar, adding layers of depth to combat.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nBattle Crush is a live service game, and as such, it is set to introduce monetization elements such as battle passes, cosmetics, and daily bonuses. While the foundation for live-service is already here, it's important to note that all 15 characters are currently available to all players, but that may change as the game matures. Perhaps some of these existing characters will be locked behind a grindy progression system, or maybe new characters will be added for that purpose. I would prefer to keep these 15 characters free, though, as they provide an excellent starting point for a battle royale hero roster.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nAs of the current beta test, I found the performance still a bit lacking, and even the game doesn't support my phone's aspect ratio which is pretty standard (seems to be locked to 16:9 only), probably because it is also being developed for the Switch and for PC (Steam). I also found the controls to bit a bit too floaty and unresponsive, and it feels like everything has a delay for me, on top of some of the already delayed attacks like Heavy Attacks and the Ultimate. This aspect needs more work in order to be able to provide a more fluid combat experience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nBattle Crush Beta presents an interesting blend of two popular gaming genres, in a lighthearted and bite sized manner. The gameplay is a dynamic blend of short battle royale matches, frantic clashes, and varied abilities, with a MOBA-style combat system that strikes a balance between accessibility and depth.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6468570) Originally posted on TapTap.",

From battle royale style of gameplay to sports-like team-based matches, Players can invite friends to play with them up to the maximum team size of the game mode.\r\nThe first mode I unlocked was the Battle Royale mode called Showdown. Solo play first, then the Duo version is unlocked next alongside Brawl Ball which is the sports-like mode and is the most played mode recently last month.\r\nI soon unlocked Gem Grab, and it’s about holding more gems for your team until the time runs out. The game modes are varied enough and the maps and events rotate every few hours so there is a lot variety even for regular players.\r\nIn Showdown, there are ten players around a relatively sized large maps with energy boosts and bushes to hide into, and the map gets smaller and smaller as time passes, thanks to a toxic gas cloud. For duo modes, it’s five teams.\r\nGetting energy boosts increase your brawlers power, and incentivizes players who tries to find these boosts across the map and alongside the toxic cloud, it serves as a catalyst for players to move around and reveal themselves. The game mode is quick, decisive, and fun. Although I found it easy to snowball matches with the other team having no way to upset you, if you grow too powerful.\r\nHonestly, just try it out, with its plethora of game modes available, there’s bound to be game mode that you’ll probably like. Although you'll have to play a lot of the Showdown or Brawl Ball first to unlock other modes.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6468997) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Brawl StarsGlobal\r\n8.2\r\nAction\r\nArcade\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nBrawl Stars, developed and published by Supercell, has been lighting up mobile gaming since its release on December 12, 2018, and has no plans on stopping. This multiplayer online battle arena and third-person hero shooter brings together a diverse cast of characters called Brawlers and unique fun gameplay modes.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Diverse characters with unique abilities\r\n- Smooth and fluid performance\r\n- Multiple gameplay modes which are all fun and great for solo or with friends alike\r\n- Quick matches, only around a minute or so\r\n- No energy system to limit play## Cons\r\n-Pay-to-Win elements are present\r\n-Balancing issues with brawlers\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## ✊Introducing the Brawlers\r\nAn eclectic cast of characters, each with their own distinct abilities and playstyles. These characters are unlocked through via credits and chroma credits on progression systems like Starr Road, via Battle Passes, or by spending money. You can further personalize your Brawlers by acquiring skins through Gems, Star Points, Coins, or the Brawl Pass, adding a unique flair to your in-game experience.\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nBrawl Stars features a unique and visually appealing art style that combines vibrant, cartoony graphics with detailed character designs and fluid animations.  The game's graphics are characterized by bright and vivid colors. The environments, characters, and special effects are all designed in a colorful and cartoony manner. Each Brawler has its distinct appearance, animations, and personality, as well as a host of cosmetics to be unlocked by the player.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay Mechanics\r\nBrawl Stars offers a unique blend of strategy and action. Players control their Brawlers using on-screen joysticks and can perform normal attacks, super moves that charge as you engage opponents, gadgets with special abilities, and hypercharges that temporarily boost your Brawler's capabilities. Brawlers can only have three attack charges at a time and using them will need a cooldown to be able to attack again. This prevents spam attacks and rewards players with good precision and timing.\r\nFurthermore, each Brawler can be upgraded with Gold and Power Points affecting their attacks, health, movement speed, and recharge time, making it technically a pay-to-win as you can spend money to upgrade the performance of these characters. Additionally, Brawlers may possess unique traits that influence their interactions with the game's environment and other characters.\r\n## 📜Variety of Game Modes\r\nOne of Brawl Stars' strengths is its wide array of game modes, catering to various playstyles. From the battle royale-style Showdown to team-based sports-like matches in Brawl Ball, players have plenty of choices. As you progress, more modes unlock, such as Gem Grab, where the objective is to hold gems until the timer runs out. The game modes are varied enough and the maps and events rotate every few hours so there is a lot variety even for regular players. Honestly, for the majority of mobile gamers, there’s bound to be game mode that they’ll probably like.\r\nShowdown, the first game mode in Brawl Stars and it’s Battle Royale mode, pits ten players against each other on progressively shrinking maps by way of a toxic gas cloud. Power boosts and bushes for hiding add layers of strategy to the game. The toxic gas cloud keeps the action intense as players must continually reposition.\r\nGetting power boosts increases your brawlers power, and incentivizes players who tries to find these boosts across the map and alongside the toxic cloud, it serves as a catalyst for players to move around and reveal themselves. The game mode is quick, decisive, and fun. Although I found it easy to snowball matches with the other team having no way to upset you, if you grow too powerful.  Overall, the ighting feels satisfying and the matches are very brief, lasting around anywhere between a minute to five minutes\r\nFor competitive players, the Power League unlocks at 4500 trophies, providing a structured ladder system with ranks and seasons that last two months. The competitive scene offers a chance to earn Star Points based on your rank. There are more game modes and events that you can participate in, and these are just some examples.\r\n## 💵In-Game Purchases\r\nBrawl Stars does feature in-game purchases, which can provide advantages in certain situations. Players can also spend money to gain  Gems, Star Points, Coins, or progress the Premium Battle Pass called Brawl Pass.  At first, it was confusing with all the currencies in place, thankfully one single tooltip feature is all it needed to explain everything.\r\nHonestly, it’s a bit pay-to-win with regards to acquiring better Brawlers or upgrading their power, but ultimately, remains a skill-based game.  I also love that there is no energy system so you can play all day without restrictions.\r\n## 📊Performance\r\nAlthough the graphical settings were a bit lacking and basic, the game ran absolutely smooth and I think it was locked to 60fps at all times on my Snapdragon 888 device. I had no slowdowns whatsoever nor any crashes. The menu navigation is also snappy and the clear user interface with the big fonts and buttons really helps a lot. The developers really nailed it in the technical department.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nBrawl Stars is a very engaging and fast-paced mobile game that offers a diverse set of gameplay modes, characters, and events. Despite some pay-to-win elements, its core remains skill-based, and the overall game itself is fun, and perfect for both casual and competitive gamers.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6468998) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The core gameplay centers on large scale hack-and-slash combat on expansive, open battlefields. Players command their chosen officers to engage in epic battles against hordes of enemies and rival officers, using combos and special attacks to dominate the field.\r\nCombat is undoubtedly a highlight of Dynasty Warriors M and the series as a whole. The game provides an immensely satisfying experience as players face off against hundreds of on-screen soldiers and officers. Each officer boasts unique weapons and abilities, and players must skillfully execute combos and special attacks to handle massive groups of foes. The battles are visually striking, with an abundance of on-screen action, featuring intricate animations and detailed character models.\r\nIn addition to the gacha character progression, the game incorporates a kingdom building aspect.

    "body": "Cities Skylines II is an immersive city-building experience that combines creativity with strategic planning. As mayor of your virtual city, you'll shape a thriving metropolis from the ground up.\r\nWhen I started the game, performance hit me in the face with around 10+ FPS even in the main menu. I quickly adjusted the settings to prioritize performance, and immediately experienced a better-performing game, running at around 40-60 FPS on my aging i7-8700k processor paired with an RTX 3080. However, as I grew my city to over 30,000 citizens, my performance took significant hits, dropping below 30 FPS, accompanied by heavy frame drops and freezes. Sometimes, it even becomes a slideshow. So yeah, performance = BAD\r\nGameplay wise, it is all about the creation of your city, starting with a blank canvas. The initial phases are where you'll lay down the foundations, setting up roads, power, water, and sewage systems. These elements are the lifeblood of your city, and their efficient design is crucial. Personally I started with the sandbox mode, so I could freely construct the City of my own likings without budget or progression limitations, and it is just as fun.\r\nA lot of things have been added and improved upon compared to the first game which was already excellent as it. The most notable change is the expanded map size, offering a fivefold increase in playable area. In the original game, players had access to a 5x5 grid of map tiles, with only nine unlockable. In Cities: Skylines 2, there are 441 map tiles, each 1/3 smaller, enabling players to create sprawling metropolises and intricate city systems.\r\nBuilding tools have been refined, taking inspiration from popular player-created mods, particularly for road construction. This results in a more accessible and user-friendly experience for both new and experienced players.\r\nThe AI system has been overhauled, providing more personalized and realistic NPC behavior. Players can follow citizens' Lifepaths, witnessing their daily routines and behaviors, adding depth and connection to the city. The progression system now relies on Development Trees and Milestones, offering a more customizable approach to unlocking buildings, services, and policies.\r\nOverall, I am having a blast creating my own city and it is about every bit as fun as when I first fired up Cities Skylines, or even SimCity 4. If only the performance wasn't such a deal breaker. For now I cannot recommend it unless you have a decent PC and even then you'd have to be okay with sub 30FPS performance.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6476565) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This follow-up title from Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order builds upon the success of the original Cities: Skylines while introducing a host of new features and improvements. With the promise of a five times larger playable area, enhanced building tools, overhauled progression systems, and much more, Cities Skylines II aims to redefine the city-building genre once again.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Addicting and immersive city building experience\r\n- Expanded map size\r\n- Improved city building tools\r\n- Complex simulation of traffic, economy, and citizens\r\n- Dynamic climate and seasonal changes\r\n- Mod and gamepad support## Cons\r\n-Massive performance issues that may make it unplayable for 99% of players\r\n-Not as feature-packed as the first game with its DLCs\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 🎨Graphics\r\nThe graphics and art style of Cities Skylines II have undergone a significant upgrade, further enhancing the visual appeal of the game. Building upon the charm of the original, the sequel retains its signature top-down perspective but presents it in a more detailed and refined manner.\r\nOne of the most noteworthy additions in Cities Skylines II is the inclusion of Cinematic and Free Camera modes. These modes allow players to appreciate the beauty of their cities from new angles. In Free Camera mode, players have access to various lenses, filters, and the ability to manipulate weather and time of day. This enables them to capture stunning snapshots of their city's development, a feature that caters to the creative minds who want to share their creations with the world. The Cinematic Mode takes it a step further, offering detailed tools for video recording, making it an excellent addition for those who want to create videos showcasing their cities or even documenting natural disasters.\r\nImmediately after starting it, the soundtrack brought me back to the good old days of SimCity 4, with a cheerful and lighthearted melody that captures the essence of the game's playful simulation tone, which is also in line with the soundtrack of the first game.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game begins with the creation of your city, a blank canvas waiting to be transformed into a bustling metropolis. The initial phases are where you'll lay down the foundations, setting up roads, power, water, and sewage systems. These elements are the lifeblood of your city, and their efficient design is crucial.\r\nZoning plays a pivotal role in shaping your city's character. Residential zones will house your citizens, commercial zones are where businesses will flourish, and industrial zones provide the backbone of your economy. Balancing the distribution of these zones and the services they require is a delicate task. Over time, your city's skyline will evolve, and you'll witness the birth of towering skyscrapers, bustling shopping districts, and sprawling industrial complexes.\r\n## 🏢Manage your city\r\nEffective city management goes beyond roads and zoning. To keep your citizens happy and your city running smoothly, you must provide essential services. These include schools to educate the youth, healthcare facilities to ensure well-being, and fire and police stations to maintain safety. New to Cities: Skylines 2 is the ability to upgrade these services, reducing the need to clutter your city with multiple variations of the same building.\r\nMoreover, the game introduces modern services such as internet and cell towers. These are vital for keeping your citizens connected in the digital age. The inclusion of these services adds a layer of realism to your city and reflects the modern challenges faced by real-world urban planners.\r\nOne of the most satisfying aspects of Cities Skylines II is watching your city grow and evolve over time. From the humble beginnings of a small town, you'll witness the emergence of towering skyscrapers, bustling commercial districts, and sprawling industrial areas. The game's expansive map size allows for endless possibilities, from creating multiple small towns to a sprawling mega-city.\r\n## 🌍 Five times the fun... or stress?\r\nThe most obvious difference with the first game is the massive increase in map size. While the first game had a 5x5 map tile area, Cities Skylines II boasts a colossal 441 map tiles, providing players with a canvas five times larger. This expansion empowers players to create sprawling cities or multiple smaller towns within a single city system, enhancing creativity and customization.\r\n## 💵Economy Simulation\r\nThe ripple effect of your economic choices is a captivating aspect of gameplay. Shortages of resources can lead to economic downturns, which, in turn, affect unemployment and citizen happiness. This realistic economic modeling encourages players to think strategically, considering the long-term consequences of their decisions.\r\n## 🚦Traffic management\r\nEfficient transportation is the lifeblood of a thriving city. Just like the first game, road systems and public transportation networks play a pivotal role. The game offers an enhanced road-building experience inspired by popular player-created mods from the first game. These tools make planning and managing roads more intuitive, even for complex layouts. The tools are more granular and can make better adjustments now.\r\n## 🌤 Weather effects\r\n## 🏯Architectural themes\r\nThe game allows you to personalize your city like never before. You can choose between European and North American themes, which influence everything from road markings to architectural styles. It’s only two themes for now, but it sets the foundation for future mods and DLCs to take advantage of this feature.\r\n## 🚶Citizen Simulation\r\nThe games goes the extra mile with its improved AI for NPC citizens that adds a personal touch to city management. NPC citizens now have lifepaths, you can follow individuals, tracking their daily routines and life events. Over time, your citizens age and pass away, leaving a lasting impact on your city's history. It's a feature that adds depth and emotional connection to the citizens who call your city home.\r\n## 📰The literal noise of radio and social media\r\nThe city feels alive with two radio networks to listen to, GTA-style. We also have Chirper, a Twitter-esque feed back from the first game that sends continuous updates on the city's daily affairs. However, the radio networks quickly became repetitive even after just a few hours, and it became increasingly annoying as I played more with repeating bits and lines. On the other hand, Chirper feels disconnected from what is actually happening in the game. For example, citizens will complain and constantly chirp about health problems, whereas I have essentially overwhelming healthcare coverage for all my citizens.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression system in the sequel has evolved, with Development Trees and Expansion Points replacing traditional Milestones. This change allows players to have more control over their city's development and offers a more customized experience. I like this change better and it results in varied playthroughs and playstyles.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWhen I started the game, performance hit me in the face with around 10+ FPS even in the main menu. I quickly adjusted the settings to prioritize performance, and immediately experienced a better-performing game, running at around 40-60 FPS on my aging i7-8700k processor paired with an RTX 3080. However, as I grew my city to over 30,000 citizens, my performance took significant hits, dropping below 30 FPS, accompanied by heavy frame drops and freezes. Sometimes, it even becomes a slideshow. This is a game that clearly requires optimization work, or it might be take the Crysis route, where we simply just wait for newer, more powerful hardware to handle the game.\r\nOne notable feature I do like though, is the controller support. Since the game is also coming out for consoles next year. It’s nice to have this already implemented in the PC version, as strategy games are usually notorious for strictly adhering to having only mouse and keyboard control schemes.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nCities Skylines II successfully builds upon the strong foundation laid by its predecessor. The game offers a vast and visually engaging canvas for players to unleash their creativity and urban planning skills. With an expanded map size, improved building tools, a deeper economic system, and an overhauled AI, Cities: Skylines 2 delivers a robust city-building experience that caters to both newcomers and veterans of the genre, that is if you have a PC from the future that can run the game comfortably.\r\nIt is already a good game and is better than Vanilla Cities Skylines in many ways. Content-wise, it still lacks some DLC and expansion features from the first game, but, as far as basic city-building gameplay goes, it doesn't feel like I was deliberately deprived of features just to sell them to me later. Of course, the foundation for adding DLCs is always there; this is Paradox we're talking about. However, given that the game still suffers from performance optimization issues, it might be wiser to wait until the game matures with updates and more DLCs if you genuinely want the best Cities: Skylines II experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6476591) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Wizard of Legend Mobile\r\n9.2\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nRoguelike\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nWizard of Legend Mobile is a a portable port of the popular PC title that successfully recreates the magic of the original game while adapting to touchscreen controls. This game delivers a fast-paced and challenging roguelike adventure, which is well suited for gaming on the go.\r\nThe timing of this mobile release couldn't be better, especially with the recent announcement of the upcoming Wizard of Legend 2. With the sequel on the horizon, fans and newcomers to the series alike have an opportunity play the first game on their mobile phones.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fast-paced satisfying spell-based combat\r\n- Challenging roguelike elements and progression\r\n- Procedurally generated dungeons\r\n- Spell and Item customization\r\n- Touch and Gamepad support## Cons\r\n-Stunlock is overused as a combat mecahnic\r\n-Progression system can feel grindy\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\nStory and Premise\r\nSet in the Kingdom of Lanova, Wizard of Legend Mobile immerses players in the annual Chaos Trials held by the Council of Magic. The game doesn't dwell heavily on storytelling, but its Museum tour style of introduction adds a touch of charm and context. At the end of the day, the game is not about an intricate plot but rather about spellcasting and battling foes.\r\nWizard of Legend is all about gameplay. The short but sweet backstory doesn't interfere with the primary action, which revolves around battling through the trials, mastering the art of spell combinations, and exploring this world of magic.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe transition from the PC version to a smaller screen is basically translated 1:1, preserving the pixel art style and visual charm. The retro pixel art style is wonderfully animated, Every spell, every enemy has a unique character, and there is attention to detail. The visuals are both captivating and charming, even during the visual clutter of combat. The heroic orchestral soundtrack that reminds me of the Superman theme, complements the pixel art and magical theme beautifully. Each element, from spells to characters, fits seamlessly into the overall aesthetic.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nWizard of Legend Mobile is basically the fast-paced gameplay of the original version while adapting to touch controls, with optional gamepad support. The controls are pretty easy to grasp, left touch for movement and right touch for the skills. It is noticeably harder to control the character because of the touch controls as oppooed to using a gamepad, so this adds an extra challenge to the already difficult nature of Wizard of Legend.\r\nYou start with a choice of four arcanas (spells), and as you explore the dungeons, you can collect, loot, and buy additional spells. The spells you loot are instantly unlocked for future runs, eliminating the need to repurchase them. Wizard of Legend Mobile boasts an impressive list of spells and items, including around 200 spells and 180 relics. Relics, on the other hand, add depth to the game by modifying various aspects of the gameplay. Some offer significant advantages, while others come with drawbacks. Careful relic selection can lead to powerful character builds, allowing you to crush the Grandmaster.\r\nThe procedurally generated dungeons called Trials is pretty linear in terms of progression, but the maps themselves are a labyrinth that the player will need to explore. You’ll encounter NPCs along the way that provides services to the player such as Relic, Arcana, or Potions vendors, with color coded portals that can bring you back and forth to the start of the dungeon. The end of the dungeons lies a mini-boss and completing them advances you to the next level. This is the basic gist of the game, and you’ll find not much variety in the dungeons and bosses except for the elements and colors, and it can get repetitive over time due to the limited level design and enemy variety. However, since the dungeon layouts, enemy encounters, and available spells are randomized, each run presents a fresh challenge, replayability is high even if it can get repetitive.\r\nThe progression in the game is engaging, as you aim to unlock new items and enhance your character with the currency you collect. The game heavily relies on RNG for spell and item acquisition. While this randomness adds unpredictability and replay value, it can also lead to frustration when players are unable to access certain spells or items that would enhance their preferred playstyle. This can make the game very grindy and leave players feeling like they've made no progress even after playing for hours.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nYou'll encounter a wide array of enemies, each with distinct abilities and attack patterns. The game's challenge lies in your ability to adapt to different enemy tactics. You'll need to learn when to dodge, when to strike, and when to use your spells strategically to overcome your adversaries. When you die, you reset back again and can go right back into runs again, or perhaps you’d want to tweak your starting Arcanas and Relics.\r\nYou'll rely on a wide array of Arcanas to take on conjured enemies and prove your magical prowess. The combat system allows for creative spell combinations, making every encounter a puzzle to solve. Chaining these spells together to unleash devastating combinations is incredibly satisfying. Maybe you want to unleash AOE spells all the time, maybe you’ll want to have defensive spells, or perhaps you’d want to disable the enemies first before dealing damage, just to be safe.\r\nThe game is designed to keep you on your toes, as you can go from full health to defeated in a matter of seconds. The game is notorious for heavy use of the stunlock mechanics, which is a double edged sword. It can be overpowering for the player to constantly stunlock enemies to death, but it can also be frustratingly unfair when groups of enemies catch you offguard, back you into a corner and basically chop half your health because you got stunlocked. At these times, the game feels floaty and unresponsive, and I found this not to be a great combat mechanic.\r\nThe game can also become visually cluttered during intense combat scenarios, especially in crowded rooms with multiple enemies and numerous spell effects. This visual clutter can make it challenging to track incoming attacks, leading to unintended stunlock situations where players are unable to dodge or counter effectively.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nPerformance wise, Wizard of Legend Mobile ran absolutely well on my Snapdragon 888 device. I’ve experienced no slowdowns or FPS drops even during visual clutters and you will pretty much forget that you’re playing on a mobile phone instead of the original game on PC or consoles. Controller support is implemented, complete with its own UI navigation and button prompts. The game has no graphics settings, and adjusts accordingly based on your phone’s specs. There is also an aim assist/auto target support option to assist the player.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nIf you enjoy action-packed combat, highly difficult roguelike challenges, and the thrill of playing as a mage, sorcerer, wizard, or basically any casters, Wizard of Legend Mobile offers a satisfying gameplay experience. The touch controls work well to bring fast-paced combat and spell combinations to mobile devices, and it's basically a 1:1 well-made port. I found it immensely difficult to master and progress in, but it's a game that encourages creativity and adaptability, making every run a unique adventure.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6473734) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Ghostrunner 2\r\n8.8\r\nRPG\r\nAction\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nGhostrunner 2 is a game that features lightning-fast, one-hit-kill combat and parkour gameplay. Developed by One More Level and published by 505 Games, this game aims to capture the essence of the first while expanding on its foundation, offering a compelling experience for fans and newcomers alike.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 3D cyberpunk ninja simulator\r\n- Best-in-class first person parkour and combat\r\n- Improved mechanics from the first game\r\n- Variety in level design\r\n- Bonus roguelike mode\r\n- Forgiving and instantaneous loading checkpoint system\r\n## Cons\r\n- Minor performance issues\r\n- Pacing is debatably worse than the first game\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story\r\nGhostrunner 2 kicks off not long after the events of its predecessor, and this time, the story is more involved in the experience. Players are once again back on the post-apocalyptic cyberpunk dystopia known as Dharma City. The game also now features a hub world in-between missions where players can talk to NPCs new and returning, and learn more about their backstories and motivations, adding character and world-building to the narrative.\r\nThe sequel's approach to storytelling is a significant improvement over its predecessor, giving players a reason to connect with the game beyond its lightning-fast combat, although there is no way to skip these hub missions to go to the next level, so players looking to experience the same fast-paced nature of the first game with its unrelenting barrage of missions might be disappointed.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nGhostrunner 2 thrives in delivering an art style that embraces the cyberpunk aesthetic with flair. The world is a mesmerizing blend of neon lights, stark contrasts, and oppressive cityscapes that scream dystopia. The design of Dharma City and its beyond areas are all visually distinct, with each locale feeling like a work of art. The level variety, from the towering spires to the sprawling open environments, showcases the game's visual range. The art style complements the narrative's darker tones and the frenetic gameplay.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nI was a bit worried that the sequel will try and change things up, including the one-hit-kill mechanic. Fortunately, the sequel remains true to its gameplay formula. You, along with your adversaries, are incredibly fragile, most are dead in just one hit: one shot or one slash is all it takes. It creates a relentless sense of tension and urgency. If you slip up, you pay the price. Thankfully, game's quick respawn system, almost instantaneous loading, and forgiving checkpoints that save scums by itself at every corner ensures that frustration doesn't overtake your enjoyment. It's a mechanic that may sound punishing, but it's the essence of the Ghostrunner experience, providing a near-constant adrenaline rush.\r\n## ⚔️Parkour and Combat\r\nThe game is essentially a 3D cyberpunk ninja simulator, and it excels in making you feel like a cybernetically enhanced badass. The parkour segments involve wallrunning, railgrinding, grapple hooking, and pole swinging, and they introduce an impressive variety of challenges and mix them up with each other along with your abilities. The level design is carefully crafted to demand precise movements, creating an exhilarating flow as you traverse the environment. In some instances, you'll need to use special abilities like the Shuriken to disable or activate elements while parkour-ing, adding a layer of complexity and puzzle-solving to the parkour sections.\r\nCombat in Ghostrunner 2 is just as intense and satisfying. It's like a high-stakes puzzle where you must determine the best approach to deal with various enemies, factoring in their behavior, the environment, and your skillset. The addition of block mechanic and its stamina system brings a new dimension to combat, allowing you to block attacks and dash multiple times, adding a new layer to movement in the game. There are special abilities like Shurikens to deal electrical damage or Shadow Skills to become invisible. Moreover, Ghostrunner 2 introduces the concept of ultimates, enhancing the combat with powerful abilities that can be a game-changer. The boss fights are now with less parkouring, and has more traditional style of boss fights where you need to dodge enemy attacks and deplete their HP.\r\nPerhaps the biggest addition in the game is new motorcycle segments, which introduce a dynamic and exhilarating change of pace. These segments are a significant departure from the intense one-hit-kill combat and parkour elements that dominate the rest of the gameplay. They involve high-speed chases, environmental challenges, and serve as an exploration tool in the latter semi-open world part of the story. Personally, I would have preferred the original pacing of the game with its parkour-based gameplay and one-hit-kill combat. But this is something that is now a part of the Ghostrunner experience.\r\nOverall, both the parkour, combat, and motorcycle segments are challenges and puzzles that are needed to be solved. You’re almost always expected to take multiple tries to successfully pass through. Every death and retry is an opportunity to refine your tactics and find creative solutions.\r\n## 🎲Ghostrunner 2 is also a rogue-lite… kinda\r\nThe game also includes a secret roguerunner.exe mode (unlocked by playing the Main Story) where it takes on the form of a roguelike game with high replayability thanks to its dynamic and randomized factors. In this mode, players are presented with four distinct stages, each consisting of a series of challenging nodes, some involving parkour and others combat. The challenges start off relatively manageable and gradually increase in difficulty as you progress through the stage.\r\nSuccessful completion of a challenge node rewards players with modifiers and extra lives. Modifiers enhance the player's abilities and come in various rarities, while extra lives are essential to continue your run, as once your lives are depleted, the run ends.\r\nEach stage concludes with a daunting challenge room that combines parkour and combat elements. Overcoming this challenge room marks the completion of the stage and allows players to progress to the next unlocked stage, provided they've made sufficient progress in the main story.\r\n## 🏠The Hub\r\nOne notable addition in Ghostrunner 2 is the hub, where you interact with fellow rebels before embarking on missions. This change places a more significant emphasis on character interactions and world-building. You can also upgrade your character here and unlock new abilities or perks.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nGhostrunner 2 reimagines its progression system, simplifying the skill progression by unlocking upgrade chips naturally as you play through the campaign. You have the flexibility to choose which chips to purchase, but to equip them, you must find purple memory chips hidden within each level. This incentivizes exploration and secrets, which actually has real tangible impact to the gameplay now, offering meaningful enhancements to your abilities.\r\nThe upgrade chips significantly impact your approach to the game. Investing in Shurikens can give you a ranged edge, while improving your sword skills can reward perfect parries. You can invest in defensive capabilities, offensive bonuses, or better parkour and movement. The progression system allows players to strengthen their preferred playstles, or perhaps experiment with new ones, discovering the most effective combinations.\r\nGhostrunner 2 is a very short game by today’s metrics. Even with its one-hit-kill difficulty, the game will only around take around ten or so hours to complete. Luckily, At $40, it is $30 lower than AAA offerings and is probably worth the money f you really like the first game. It isn’t a strict requirement to play the first game, as there is a video recap of the first game anyway, but I highly recommend playing it first.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game ran relatively well on my i7-8700k and RTX 3080. I was CPU bottlenecked at around 80FPS at any settings (low or high) so I just capped the game to 60 and it was fine all throughout the game at high settings and DLSS. There were stutters that took my timing off with the parkouring a little bit, especially before the framerate cap, but it all became less noticeable as I played more of the game and had fun.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nGhostrunner 2 is that is faithful to what made the first game great while introducing new features and gameplay mechanics — most are welcome, some are debatable. The parkour segments are still one of the best first person parkour systems ever made, and the addition of motorcycle and The Hub segments adds a nice change of pace and allows players to take a breather in this fast paced world. If the first game was great in your books, then this sequel is definitely a must-play, building on what made the original great and perhaps one of the best Cyberpunk experiences in the market today.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6481096) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Recently, I had the opportunity to try Wizard of Legend Mobile, the mobile port of the popular Wizard of Legend originally released on PC in 2018 and on other consoles.  Well, it's basically the same game just on your mobile phone.\r\nWizard of Legend Mobile is all about action-packed spell casting combat and roguelike dungeon crawling. The game thrusts you into the role of an up and coming wizard who must overcome the yearly Chaos Trials, a series of magical challenges that test your spellcasting skills and combat prowess. From the get-go, the action is relentless, and the game is very difficult to both play and progress into.\r\nIn my initial hours with the game, it has already proven itself to be immensely challenging. The roguelike elements keep you on your toes, persistent progression is notoriously slow, and the procedurally generated dungeons ensure that no two runs are the same.  As you explore dungeons, you'll unlock new spells and relics to use, to be able to fare better next time, not to mention you'll need to hone your actual player skills.\r\nThe combat is fast-paced, requiring quick reflexes and strategic thinking. Combining spells is the key to success, and the game encourages experimentation to create devastating spell combinations. You'll find yourself casting, dodging, and chaining spells together to obliterate enemies in a dazzling display of magic.\r\nWhile the progression is indeed slow, the game does a great job of hooking you in with its initial flash of gameplay and combat to keep playing, which is done very well. As primarily a magic user in most of the RPG games that I play, this basically focuses that element into one roguelike game, and it works out very well. Easy to learn, fun to play, hard to master.\r\nThis mobile release is just timely as Wizard of Legend 2 has already been announced and is coming soon.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6473720) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "THE FINALS is currently in an open beta test on Steam that started last October 26 and will run up to November 5, available for PC (Steam), Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.\r\nIt's basically an FPS game with class-based abilities where teams of three players battle it out with other teams on the map and go for objectives such as collecting cash or defending vaults to win the game.\r\nThe open beta currently has limited servers, so it took me a lot of time to find matches, but when I did, its legit tons of fun. The combat in THE FINALS is an explosive, high-octane experience. It's fast paced, but the players have noticeably high HP and take longer to kill than other shooters, you’ll probably unload a magazine or two to kill just one player.\r\nHowever, the gameplay is still engaging and encourages teamwork, ability use, and proper map knowledge and positioning in order to succeed. The game is firmly rooted in the shooter genre, but it offers a fresh take by merging elements of realism and arcade-style action.\r\nI got disconnected during the tutorial phase, so I had to learn the game mechanics via trial by fire. At first, I encountered some difficulties killing players due to the high TTK (time to kill), but once I found my groove in this game, I started to enjoy it more.\r\nRegarding the abilities, the flashy visuals are not over-the-top and don't create visual clutter, Although the destruction on the other hand is simply superb. I have never seen a game like this since Battlefield introduced total destruction in their games and then subsequently toned down that feature in recent years. In this game, looks like its going all out with the destruction. Walls, Floors, Pillars have been destroyed. Entire roofs have collapse all over our objectives.\r\nThere is also a lot of verticality in this game. Buildings have multiple floors and rooftops. There are ziplines to use in the environment, and jump pads to be deployed by the players.\r\nOverall, I had a lot of fun and will be recommend this to everyone to play once it releases. I'll definitely invite my friends to play with me in this game, as playing solo is hard, especially that there are only three players and high TTK.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6481958) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "THE FINALS\r\n9.2\r\nFast-paced\r\nAction\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nTHE FINALS is a free-to-play team-based competitive FPS, featuring class-based abilities, realistic visuals, and a destructible environment. Developed by Embark Studios, founded by former DICE developers, the game is currently in an open beta test on Steam that started last October 26 and will run up to November 5, available for PC (Steam), Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nTHE FINALS' premise is reminiscent of dystopian-themed entertainment like \"The Hunger Games\" and battle royale video games like Apex Legends. The matches are set within a televised game show, where players act as participants, vying for victory in a flashy, high-octane spectacle. The game's user interface and menu design reflect the reality TV show premise beautifully, complete with in-game commentary and the distant sounds of an enthusiastic audience. The presentation is top-notch and fully immerses you in this dystopian battle arena.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe visuals in THE FINALS are simply stunning, with lifelike lighting that adds depth and realism and vibrant level design and environments. The character designs are sleek and complement the game's futuristic premise. The art style strikes a perfect balance between realism and entertainment, which is quite a feat considering the game's arcade-like elements.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay Overview\r\nTHE FINALS is an FPS game at its core that provides a unique blend of realism and arcade shooting elements. The movement feels weighty and grounded, while the guns maintain a realistic feel. It's not a game where you'll be bunny hopping around like in some other shooters, This feeling of weight in the movement adds a level of strategy and tension to the gameplay that's often missing in other arena shooters. Despite all this, there is a high level of vertically in this game with the inclusion of jump pads, ziplines, and zero fall damage. Buildings also have multiple floors and rooftops, all accessible by the players.\r\nThe game's three available classes (Light, Medium, and Heavy) each come with distinct abilities and gadgets. The Light class can dash, cloak, and dash again for a nimble and stealthy approach. The Medium class offers the ability to deploy healing and activate recon vision, while the Heavy class is all about charging attacks and ground slams. These class distinctions create a dynamic team-based experience, encouraging players to work together strategically to succeed. You start with a basic loadout and can customize it as you progress and unlock more by playing more matches or availing the paid Battle Pass.\r\n## 🔫Combat\r\nThe combat in THE FINALS is an explosive, high-octane experience. The Time to Kill (TTK) is notably high compared to games like Call of Duty or Valorant. It doesn't take just a split second to eliminate an opponent. This aspect makes the game feel more akin to Apex Legends, where TTK is higher and you’ll probably unload a magazine or two to kill just one player. However, the gameplay is still engaging and feels fast-paced. The game is firmly rooted in the shooter genre, but it offers a fresh take by merging elements of realism and arcade-style action.\r\nRegarding the abilities, the flashy visuals are not over-the-top and don't create visual clutter like games such as Overwatch or Valorant, Although the destruction on the other hand is simply superb. I have never seen a game like this since Battlefield introduced total destruction in their games and then subsequently toned down that feature in recent years. In this game, looks like its going all out with the destruction. Walls, Floors, Pillars have been destroyed. Entire roofs have collapse all over our objectives.\r\nAs a solo player during my open beta experience so far, this game is difficult, as the game is highly teamwork dependent with its objective-based matches, multi-team setup, and high TTK. You'd never know what teammates you're gonna get and the small 3-man setup amplifies this. It's going to be hard to carry two randoms in this game so I'd recommend playing this with friends, no matter what role you choose to play.\r\n## 💥Destructible Environments\r\nThe game takes a page from the early days of Battlefield, where destruction was a game-changer. In THE FINALS, destruction is not just cosmetic; it's strategic. You can use it to your advantage in numerous ways, from blowing up the floor above an opponent to creating cover from the rubble. What's truly impressive is that the destruction is physics-based, so you must target critical points for efficient destruction. This is the most satisfying and comprehensive destruction system I've seen in years, and it adds a layer of depth and strategy to the gameplay that is unparalleled.\r\n## 📜The open beta includes three game modes to play in\r\nQuick Cash: This is a quick and casual 3v3v3 mode, perfect for players looking for fast-paced action. It's an ideal choice if you want a shorter, more intense gaming experience.\r\nBank it: Bank it is a new mode, a more fast-paced version of Quick Cash. In this mode, four teams of three battle for coins, making it combat-focused and casual-friendly.\r\nTournament Mode: In this mode, two simultaneous groups of four teams compete, with the top two teams eventually battling in the titular THE FINALS. This mode offers a competitive and exhilarating experience.\r\nPrevious betas have featured additional modes like Cashout, a longer version of Quick Cash, focused on collecting cash boxes from vaults and defending points for victory. The open beta features three maps, Skyway Stadium, Monaco, and Seoul.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe open beta also run smoothly on my i7-8700k RTX 3080 PC. I set everything to “Epic” and even turned on Ray Tracing. I haven’t noticed any technical bugs or issues aside from the usual server and connection problems. It takes a lot of time to find matches during the beta even going as long as 20 to 30 minutes to find one. I also wasn’t able to open the game on Steam normally and had to resort to a workaround to be able to run it.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nTHE FINALS is perhaps the most promising, refreshing, upcoming shooter that I’ve played all year. Its stunning graphics, competitive multi-team fights, engaging mechanics, and the exceptional destructible physics system set it apart in a saturated market full of game cancellations, delays, and discontinuations… and it’s completely free-to-play.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6481959) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Alan Wake II is a thrilling continuation of Remedy Entertainment's captivating narrative-driven games. The game features Remedy's signature storytelling prowess and delivers a survival-horror game experience impressive next-gen level of graphics and innovative gameplay features.\r\nIn terms of gameplay, it is much closer to the original Alan Wake than Remedy’s recent explosive and physics-based destructive games like Quantum Break and Control. It plays like a modern third person survival horror game, such as Resident Evil 2 or 3, but with more psychological thriller vibes that will mess with your head, senses, and terrify you without much physical effort.\r\nThe game offers a slow-burning, suspenseful experience. It took me some time to encounter action sequences, but these moments of intensity are masterfully crafted. The game weaves a complex narrative that combines elements of horror, psychological thriller, and supernatural mystery.\r\nAt first, you'll play as Saga Anderson, an FBI agent investigating a series of murders in Bright Falls. Eventually, you'll be able to play as Alan Wake. Further in the game’s narrative, players can take on the role of either Alan Wake or Saga Anderson, and their stories are interconnected, providing different perspectives on the unfolding mystery.\r\nOne of the game's most innovative features is the ability to play chapters in any order, giving players a sense of freedom and replayability. This choice adds a new layer to the experience and allows for diverse narrative exploration.\r\nAs a big fan of Remedy from their early Max Payne years to the most recent and excellent Control. Alan Wake 2 might be Remedy's best offering yet since the original Max Payne in terms of technical, storytelling, and gameplay prowess.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6489269) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "CoromonGlobal\r\n9.1\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nAdventure\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nCoromon is a delightful monster-taming indie RPG that captures the essence Pokémon while injecting its own unique flavor into the mix. Developed by TRAGsoft and Published by Freedom Games, Coromon offers a fresh take on the genre, blending sprite-based pixel art visuals, character and monster customization, and Zelda-like puzzle-solving elements.\r\nIt initially released on PC last year and is now making its way to mobile platforms on November 8, with a free demo and a one-time purchase of $5 to unlock the whole game. The free demo that I tried is actually out now for everyone to try here on TapTap, with progression to carry over to the full version once it releases.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nCoromon is set in the vibrant and technologically advanced world of Velua. As a newly hired Battle Researcher working for Lux Solis, a global research society, your journey begins smoothly until a mysterious force arrives. This event sets the stage for an exciting adventure as you build a squad of Coromon to confront a mysterious threat that endangers Velua.\r\nThe story is light-hearted, with a relaxed atmosphere and a dreamy, fun vibe. While it shares thematic similarities with the Pokémon franchise in its focus on creature collection and battling, Coromon brings its own unique twists to the narrative, especially with its player created protagonist who is well versed and well equipped by the time the game starts. There is also the powerful elemental Titans and a race against a shadowy organization seeking to harness their energy.\r\nThe narrative keeps players invested in the game's world. Coromon's story and premise provides a solid foundation for your adventure, encouraging exploration and development as you navigate through various zones and cities. The dialogues aren’t voice acted, but they’re brief and decently written enough to keep me compelled.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nCoromon employs sprite-based pixel art visuals, a style reminiscent of classic RPGs like Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda. However, it manages to infuse the classic look with its own unique flair. The art style is characterized by vibrant colors, strong outlines, extra detail in the animations, as well as emoji-like bubbles to show the characters emotions, all resulting in an experience that is both nostalgic and rich in character.\r\nThe overworld maps provide a top-down perspective, similar to earlier Pokémon games or 2D Zelda titles. The battle screens, on the other hand, are more detailed and take on the theme of the specific zone in which they occur. Village outskirts, an outdoor gym, desert region, rocky cave, or greeny woodlands, the background constantly changes to reflect the current location. This contributes to the game's overall charm and immersion.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nCoromon's gameplay revolves around the classic monster-taming RPG formula, similar to games like Pokémon, but with its own unique twists and features. You still roam around towns and the wilderness on a top-down view, with random encounters with Coromons when traversing through bushes and hazardous landscapes, as well as encountering other fellow trainers to battle. The battles are still turn-based, and feature different abilities for each Coromon in your lineup.\r\n## 🦑Coromons\r\nThe allows players to collect over 120 charming creatures, known as Coromon. Each Coromon has its own unique attributes, abilities, and elemental alignments, which can be a factor in building your squad. The creatures' designs are creative and varied, making each one feel like a distinct addition to your team. You can personally name them as well, adding a deeper level of personal connection and immersion. Allowing players to establish a unique bond with each Coromon, making them feel like they are real companions on your journey.\r\nThe rarity system introduces a fascinating twist, with each creature having rarer variants of its type. Unlike traditional Pokémon games, the potential of Coromon is directly influenced by its rarity, creating an incentive to hunt for potent and even perfect variants. This rarity system not only adds a layer of excitement but also extends the replayability of the game. Additionally, Coromon offers an extensive evolution system, allowing common Coromon to evolve into larger and more powerful forms as they reach certain levels or complete specific quest chains.\r\n## ⚔️Battles\r\nCoromon's combat system features tactical turn-based battles that require careful resource management. Unlike traditional Pokémon battles, where you can spam your most powerful moves, Coromon's battles demand more strategy. Each action consumes stamina, including skills, status effects, and attacks, requiring you to make thoughtful choices to overcome your opponents.\r\nThe combat screens are well-designed, again with the background art reflecting the zone in which the battle takes place. A quick press of a button opens a window displaying essential information about your actions, your opponents' elemental alignments, and more. This feature is immensely helpful, especially for newcomers to the genre or the game itself, making the gameplay accessible and intuitive. Although one gripe I have with the battles is that the animations and narrations aren't skippable, so after a while it gets old and becomes tedious to watch over again and again, especially for inconsequential encounters.\r\n## 🗺The World and Progression\r\nI have only scratched the surface with the Demo version, but the full version of Coromon's world is vast, comprising six major zones and cities interconnected by routes. These cities and villages are filled with citizens, services, and a plethora of side quests to complete. In outdoors on the other hand feature various biomes and dungeons that come complete with Zelda-like puzzles and hazards. Exploration is a rewarding experience, with hidden loot and things to discover should you venture off the beaten path.\r\nThe unique exploration actions and modules for your “Gauntlet” you unlock during your journey enhance the experience by enabling more extensive puzzle-solving and exploration. These actions add an extra layer of interactivity to the world,  instead of purely a travel from point A to point B.\r\nAlthough my minor gripe is that the maps are too cramped and too linear when it comes to connecting the zones and cities. And I always feel like I want to explore more of everything and I was consistently being kept from doing just that.\r\nThe game starts off with creating and customization your own trainer, including hair, fashion, and more. It's a small but enjoyable aspect that adds a layer of personalization to the game. The game's progression and accessibility is robust, offering players choices in how they approach the game. You can immerse yourself in the story on the easiest setting for a stress-free experience, or focus on tactics and resource management for a more challenging adventure.\r\nCoromon's mobile version introduces additional features, such as the Battle Dome mode, daily and weekly challenges to compel people to go back regularly to play, and support for 12 new languages.  Not to mention you can completely play the game using the touch controls.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe mobile version is already in a good state. A stable experience with no significant issues related to crashes or game-breaking bugs. I even had it minimized for quite a while and when I opened it, I was back in the game like nothing happened. No loading, no connection errors, or restarts. It helps that the game is completely playable offline. Coromon also features full controller support complete with UI navigation built-in.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nCoromon captures the essence of classic monster-taming RPGs while injecting its own unique personality into the mix. Its appealing pixel art evokes nostalgia while offering a fresh perspective. The gameplay of Coromon is not groundbreaking nor innovative,  but you don’t always need those qualities when the game understands its purpose and remains enjoyable at the end of the day. With its tactical turn-based battles, diverse creature collection, and an engaging evolution system, all available with a free trial and a $5 upfront cost to unlock everything else, without hidden microtransactions, trying out Coromon is a choice you can't go wrong with.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6491840) Originally posted on TapTap.",

All four characters have separate progression and uses their own stamina system, so you can basically cycle through four characters to basically quadruple the allowed playtime.\r\nThe 2.D brawler/hack and slash style combat is fast-paced, action-packed, and players can utilize two-button abilities, dodge/roll, jump, and parry/block actions to defeat enemies. The game encourages the creation of skill chains and combos for strategic and powerful combat. no need to memorize combos or have lightning fast reflexes, just customize your combo beforehand and activate it with a single tap.\r\nSince the characters are fixed, the Gacha system instead is all about obtaining and attaching Phantoms to your Skills. Phantoms are basically spirits or avatars that are activated when you use that skill attached to it. You can attach any Phantom to any skill, and customize your combos even further. The combat is cool and promising, but If ound that the 2.5D model clashes with it and makes the combat feel floaty and unresponsive.\r\nThe free-to-play game releases soon on November 2, for a variety of multi platforms (PC, PlayStation, Android, and iOS) and it's worth trying if you'll like the innovative combat system and refreshing Chinese inspired handdrawn art style.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6489732) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Resident Evil Village\r\n8.9\r\nAction\r\nSurvival horror\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nCapcom has officially unleashed Resident Evil Village onto mobile devices yesterday, October 30. Available for iPhone 15 Pro and supported iPad models equipped with an M1 chipset or better\r\nThis game, originally released for consoles and PC, brings players into a nightmarish journey through a mysterious European village, now right at their fingertips. The mobile release is the first among various AAA game announcements for Apple devices made a few months ago. The game follows a release model that begins with a completely free-to-download demo, with the full game content locked behind an in-app purchase. Next in line for Capcom is the Resident Evil 4 remake, which is a much more recent game.\r\nWith in-app purchases for unlocking the full game, the Winters’ Expansion DLC, and the All Access Voucher DLC, players can explore the horror-infused narrative while enjoying a release celebration discount of up to 60% off on full game unlock, expansion DLC, and voucher. Making the base game just $15.99, which is a bargain, especially if you haven’t played the game yet.\r\n## Pros\r\n- The full Resident Evil Village experience, without any gameplay compromises\r\n- Still impressive graphics\r\n- Controller support\r\n- Free demo\r\n## Cons\r\n- Touch control implementation is borderline unplayable. A controller is highly recommended\r\n- Massive audio sync/delay issues during cutscenes\r\n- Frame rate drops and performance is far from perfect\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📱The mobile version: Controls and Settings\r\nI played the game on an iPad Pro M1 model, but the game is also available for the iPhone 15 Pro. To get a grasp of the full mobile experience, I decide to alternate playing this with the touchscreen controls along with a proper gamepad connected via bluetooth. For the touch controls, it features virtual on-screen gamepads but there’s really no full implementation. The developers just slapped a customizable virtual joystick overlay on top of the game and called it a day, at least its customizable though.\r\nAs a touch-based game, Resident Evil Village is barely playable. Moving feels very clunky and aiming is very hard to control especially when you are aiming with LT and firing with RT at the same time. The gameplay mechanics and control are unchanged and there’s no compromise or adaptation done to better fit touchbased controls. There’s two ways to control the camera: virtual right stick or using blank part of the screen to look around like a mouse/touchpad. The latter works way better so I just stuck to using that scheme.\r\nController wise, the game supports most mainstream controllers like PlayStation or Xbox gamepad, and they’re basically the superior way of experiencing this game. I’d highly recommend bringing a controller with you whether you are playing this on an iPad or an iPhone.\r\nSettings wise, the game supports changing graphic settings, resolutions, and FPS just like a PC version would do. The freedom to do so is nice, but it would be nice to have an optimized setting depending on the device so people wouldn’t have to tinker. It supports four sets of resolutions from 1280x894 to 2388x1668 and up to 120 FPS max, although running it on an iPad Pro M1 model, the 1280x894 setting at mostly low settings seems to be the sweet spot in terms of getting a decent 30FPS. The option to increase the graphics are probably there for future, more powerful chips. Setting up the foundation for more Apple AAA gaming which is nice. The game does not use the full resolution of the display, and opts to display the game at a standard 16:9 aspect ratio.\r\nAlthough the developers have already added a third-person mode to the game for the PC and console versions, it appears that the Apple version doesn't include this feature and is limited to the first-person mode.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nResident Evil Village, the eighth main installment in Capcom's long-running survival horror series, is a game that strikes a delicate balance between paying homage to its survival horror roots and introducing fresh new elements, such as continuing the First Person mode that started with Resident Evil 7. Village continues the story of Ethan Winters and journey into the heart of a mysterious European village and its castle.\r\nResident Evil Village blends elements of classic horror storytelling with a fresh and intriguing narrative. The game opens with Ethan Winters and his wife Mia living a seemingly peaceful life with their baby daughter Rose. However, their seemingly peaceful life is soon shattered when a group of soldiers, led by Chris Redfield, storms their home, resulting in Rose's kidnapping and Ethan suddenly finding himself stranded on a strange Village. The plot revolves around Ethan's quest to rescue his daughter, which leads him to unravel the dark secrets of the village and its bizarre inhabitants.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nResident Evil Village takes significant strides in evolving the gameplay mechanics introduced in Resident Evil 7. The game retains the first-person perspective, which was a departure from the series' traditional third-person view, and continues to deliver a highly immersive and anxiety-inducing experience.\r\nResident Evil Village is all about exploration of its richly detailed and spooky environments, all while trying to survive the monsters and dangers the lurk around. Across the sprawling village itself, dilapidated houses, eerie catacombs, dark forests, and its neighboring castle, players need to solve puzzles and find key items to progress through the story. The village's lore and legends are also interwoven with the exploration and those invested in the story will find lots of interesting stuff about the game’s lore.\r\nThe inventory and crafting system allows players to create various ammunition types, healing items, and even explosives using materials found throughout the village. Resources are scarce, and players need to make critical decisions about what items to purchase and upgrade based on their playstyle and the challenges they face.\r\nAlong the way, you’ll encounter a range of enemies, including monstrous lycanthropes, grotesque mutants, and abonimations infused with technology. Combat in Resident Evil Village is both brutal and satisfying. Players are equipped with an array of firearms, from shotguns and pistols to more exotic weapons like a grenade launcher and a magnum. The shooting mechanics feel refined and responsive when using a controller. Precise aiming is rewarded: headshots will result in critical hits. For the touch controls, it isn’t really intuitive as I previously mentioned as they didn’t really invest a lot of work into translation the touch controls properly with this game. I’d highly recommend sticking to a physical controller.\r\n## 🎨Graphics, Art Style, and Audio\r\nResident Evil Village is a visual spectacle that showcases the pretty impressive RE Engine, used in Resident Evil 7 and the Resident Evil 2, 3, and 4 remakes. It basically delivers breathtaking graphics and animations, and has optimized performance across the board which probably what made the iOS/iPad port possible. The attention to detail in the environments, characters, and monsters are all AAA level.\r\nThe audio design on the other hand plays a crucial role in immersing players in the horror experience. The game's soundscapes are haunting and atmospheric, with subtle cues that keep you on edge. The creaking of floorboards, distant cries, and the howling of the wind all add to the sense of dread that permeates the game. I found it not as spooky as Resident Evil 7, but it’s still scary nonetheless. The audio for cutscenes are currently bugged right at the moment, and more on that later.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nOn my iPad Pro M1 model, the game ran at a decent 30FPS, with drops every now and then when using the  1280x894 resolution and mostly low settings. Anything higher than that and the game noticeably struggles. If you have an iPhone 15 Pro, things would probably be much worse as the iPhone has a slightly weaker GPU. The graphics still look beautiful though, despite most settings at low. There is a bit of aliasing and jagged edges especially when you are closer to the screen, but it is a service-able experience nonetheless.\r\nThe audio for this game is a currently bugged, with noticeably sync and delay issues throughout my experience especially in cutscenes. probably because the framerates can't keep up with the audio playback resulting in delay. While these audio problems don't necessarily make the game unplayable, they do have a negative impact on the overall presentation and the immersive quality of cutscenes.\r\nI also lost a significant amount of footage while recording this game for reasons unknown. The operating system likely prioritizes gaming performance for the GPU, which resulted in the built-in screen recorder on my iPad not functioning properly.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nResident Evil Village's arrival on mobile devices marks an exciting AAA expansion into mobile gaming courtesy of Apple and Capcom. On mobile devices, it still provides a solid AAA gaming experience, especially for those who appreciate the horror genre and are okay with the compromises to the visuals/performance for portability. It features touch controls, but I’d still recommend a physical gamepad. Performance wise, the game is playable on the iPad Pros, albeit with some occasional drops in frame rate. On the iPhone 15 Pro, performance might be slightly lower, nevertheless the graphics quality remains impressive for all devices, all things considered.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6494692) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Blade of God X: OrisolsGlobal\r\n8.7\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nAction\r\nPC Version\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nBlade of God II: Orisols is a hardcore ARPG set in a Nordic-inspired dark fantasy world. A sequel to the original Blade of God, players assume the roles of various heroes known as inheritors of the Library, battling hardcore bosses, one by one.\r\nDespite \"apparently\" launching last year on Google Play and last month for PC (Steam China only)., the game will start a new closed beta testing phases for the SEA region, and according to TapTap, it will start on Nov 7.\r\n## 📖Story\r\nThe story is centered around the Colossus Library, which is located deep within the Fog Realm, the root of Yggrasil. For those unfamiliar, Yggrasil basically comes from Norse Mythology. You know, Thor, Odin and his people. Yggdrasil is the cosmic tree that connects all the realms together.\r\nNow back to the Colossus Library, it has been invaded by a being called Amorphous and the Library has been damaged and its heroes corrupted. Now it’s up to our player characters, the so-called Inheritors of the Library, to redeem or sacrifice these corrupted heroes and restore the Library back to its form.\r\nThe story is a bit confusing, and the lack of voice-overs over the pretty long winded character dialogues and cutscenes doesn’t help. However there is substance in the narrative. You can opt to skip these cutscenes, and the game will nicely provide players with a brief summary of skipped events.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nBlade of God II boasts a gothic dark fantasy art style with Norse-inspired overtones. This art direction successfully conveys a sense of foreboding and a mysterious atmosphere that fits the narrative. The game's visual style draws comparisons to the Dark Souls series, thanks to its dark and gritty aesthetics.\r\nIn terms of graphics quality, the game falls somewhere between PS3 and PS4 levels of fidelity, and perhaps closer to PS4 when the graphics is at maximum. The game is brim filled with visual effects during combat, as well as over the top animations and abilities.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game offers players to choose between any of the three available characters: Chaos, Hela, and Esther, each with their unique skill sets and has their own separate progression. This variety brings a degree of replayability, as you can opt to unlock everything on one character while still starting from scratch with the others. The two unchosen characters also make appearances as side characters in the\r\nstory and as trial characters in specific missions, allowing players to explore their abilities.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat is often described as \"Dark Souls\" inspired or a Souls-like experience, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The only commonalities it shares are a third-person perspective and the ability to dodge attacks. In reality, the overall combat experience feels more like a mobile ARPG, featuring high mobility and visually striking, flashy movesets. It also doesn't feel like its predecessor, which was more of a God of War-esque game.\r\nHela and Chaos, which are both melee characters, play similarly, closing in with their enemies for a sword or an axe attack. Esther on the other hand wields guns, and can attack from a ranged position . The game doesn’t allow you to aim manually with these weapons, instead, it still functions like a hack and slash game, similar to Devil May Cry. where you just attack in the direction your looking or targetting. All characters have two variants of their attacks, light and heavy weaponry, and you can switch between these two variants at almost any time during combat as part of combos.\r\nHonestly, as of its current state, it feels too clunky and looks like its still in its very early stages. The animations look underwhelming and the visual feedback to the player isn’t the best when it comes to helping them dodge attacks or get information if their attack has connected or effective. Despite the targeting lock system, the camera work is in dire need of improvements too, with one of the camera modes being too weirdly angled towards the sky that it was a pain to play with.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nBlade of God II primarily revolves around these boss battles, with corrupted heroes now guarding Library Disks, which serve as essential tools for repairing the library. Your objective is to confront these bosses and restore the library. Each realm has multiple chapters to complete and every chapter is headlined by a unique boss at the end.\r\nThis is where the majority of your playtime will be spent, as the game strongly emphasizes boss battles over defeating regular mobs, which only play a minor and forgettable role in the chapters/levels. Some of these bosses can be incredibly challenging,  but pretty much the deciding factor, as always, will be the hero’s power level. Which can be upgraded by playing more of the game, or by leveraging the gacha system. Upon defeating these bosses, you have two choices: Sacrifice or Redemption. Depending on your choice, you will gain different rewards such as getting either Sacrificial or Redemption stones.\r\nHonestly, the menu, navigation and its presentation is s perhaps the weakest part of the game. I got lost in the sea of these features and its not a pleasant experience to dive in it and learn the different aspects of the game mechanics. The main features are the backpack (your items), transmorg (cosmetics), skills, soul cores – characters that and gear. There’s also a plethora of other minor features such as in-game stores, events, battle passes, a training mode, and daily and chapter quest rewards to attain. Pretty much most of the live service mobile game stapes are implemented.\r\nThe strongest part of the game on the other hand is that players can and will need to make their own skill combos. Featuring a fully customizable skill customization and upgrade system, complete with Soul Cores to augment these skills. This is where the gacha summoning system comes in which can give you different soul cores. This system offers players considerable freedom to mix and match skills as they see fit, allowing for the creation of potentially overpowered or weak combinations.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game does need slight optimizations for the average mobile phones to run the game with comfortably good visuals and frame rates. I was running it on a 888 snapdragon device and i’ve experience slight performance issues. Again it’s important to note that this is a test version so things can still change.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nBlade of God II: Orisols is a game with ambition but currently falls short in execution in several key areas. The game's combination of a dark fantasy narrative, Dark Souls-inspired combat, and a focus on boss fights is an interesting concept. However, the overall experience is marred by technical issues, underwhelming combat, and general polish and optimization.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6492924) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The skill chain customization mechanic is cool though, since you can customize your own combos and augment it with Soul Cores of heroes to give it unique powers. It's an ambitious title, but it ultimately needs more polish.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6492891) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game is available as a free demo, with in-app purchases allowing players to unlock the full game, and its DLCs. Currently at a discounted price of $15.99 for the base game.\r\nI played the game on an iPad Pro M1 model, which is probably in the middle tier hardware with regards to all the compatible devices. To get a grasp of the full mobile experience, I decide to alternate playing this with the touchscreen controls along with a proper gamepad connected via bluetooth.\r\nFor the touch controls, it features virtual on-screen gamepads but there’s really no full implementation. The developers just slapped a customizable virtual joystick overlay on top of the game and called it a day, at least its customizable though.\r\nThe game supports most mainstream controllers like PlayStation or Xbox gamepad, and they’re basically the superior way of experiencing this game. I’d highly recommend bringing a controller with you whether you are playing this on an iPad or an iPhone.\r\nIn terms of graphical settings, the game supports changing graphic settings, resolutions, and FPS just like a PC version would do.

    "body": "Over these past week I \"participated\" in the release of a brand new and ambitious horror game called Silent Hill Ascension, set in the iconic universe of the Silent Hill video game franchise. From the get go, it's a significant departure from the well-known Silent Hill survival horror gameplay style, moving towards a more Supermassive Games-style interactive storytelling akin to titles like Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and games such as The Quarry.\r\nHowever, the format is, in fact, much more unique. It doesn't provide the same experience as those games where there's a small gameplay element involving direct character control or even rendering graphics using your hardware. The Silent Hill Ascension app or website functions more like a streaming service, akin to Netflix or Disney+. It serves as a platform for players to engage in the narrative, watch clips, scenes, and episodes of the story. This format resembles Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, but with added interactivity and a social media touch. It's an amalgamation of gaming, Netflix, and Twitch, sprinkled with microtransactions.\r\nIt truly offers a one-of-a-kind experience but, ultimately, proves detrimental to the overall Silent Hill experience. The story fails to engage, and the daily release of long and drawn-out scenes doesn't create the same lasting impact as a traditional series.\r\nMoreover, affecting the narrative is challenging as it requires collective effort for all choices – essentially, votes. Even if you purchase influence points with real cash, you can't exert direct influence as you would in a typical interactive game. In those games, choosing between options like A, B, or C is an actual choice made by the player. In Silent Hill Ascension, it's more like casting a vote. No matter how much you desire the outcome represented by choice A, it won't happen if choice C has one million more votes.\r\nHowever, after the series finale which is expected in around six months, there's the promise of a New Game Plus speedrun with canonical outcomes disabled, featuring alternate story branches and deleted scenes. So, I find myself more excited about the series concluding and the game being released as a singular experience for everyone.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6517005) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Developed by Genvid Technologies and Behaviour Interactive in collaboration with Konami Digital Entertainment, the project marks a significant departure from the traditional survival horror gameplay that has defined the Silent Hill series. Instead, Ascension adopts a format reminiscent of interactive storytelling games like Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology while integrating a unique app-based or web-based interactive component. The game playable on both Android, iOS, or via web-browser.\r\nWith multiple possible paths and branches in the story, an interactive narrative led by viewer participation, and a worldwide streaming platform, Silent Hill: Ascension aims to redefine the Silent Hill experience.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Innovative social and presentation format\r\n- Multiple possible paths and branches in the story that will take months to finish\r\n## Cons\r\n- HUGE departure from traditional Silent Hill gameplay\r\n- Limited Interactivity\r\n- Cannot directly impact the narrative by yourself alone\r\n- Story is unengaging\r\n- Graphics are underwhelming for a pre-rendered animated series\r\n## ⭐️Score: 2/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story follows a diverse ensemble cast, each haunted by their own personal demons and battling against the traumatic horrors that threaten to consume them and their children, and the only escape from these psychological horrors lies in the decisions made by the audience in real-time. This premise provides a fresh perspective on the Silent Hill series, moving beyond the confines of the titular town to explore the psychological horror that can manifest anywhere in the world. This storytelling approach offers a broader canvas for exploring the psychological horror genre and attempts to create a truly global and immersive experience. Well, the attempt is novel and\r\nThe storytelling is a one of a kind experience, truly. but ultimately, a detriment to the whole Silent Hill experience. For the first week (daily scenes/episodes are released) that I’ve experienced, the story is unengaging, the scenes are too long and drawn out released on a daily basis that just doesn’t stick with you like a normal series would. Moreover, you cannot significantly influence the narrative on your own because it necessitates a collective effort for all the choices – or rather votes.\r\nHowever, after the series finale which is estimated to be six months from now, there will be a New Game Plus speedrun with the canonical outcomes disabled, showcasing alternate story branches and deleted scenes. So, I am much more excited about the series finishing and the game being released as a singular experience for everyone.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe graphics in the game are pre-rendered and are only shown as streamed videos on the app much like Netflix or Youtube. However, the computer animation isn't entirely modern CGI in terms of quality and still looks like something that could be rendered in real-time in-engine with modern gaming consoles. This is a bit disappointing as they could have leveraged this CGI nature and come up with some pretty impressive scenes instead.\r\nIn terms of Art Style, it retains the dark, foreboding, and eerie atmosphere that Silent Hill is known for. The visuals effectively convey the sense of dread and unease that is the hallmark of the franchise\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nHere's where Silent Hill: Ascension takes a significant departure from the traditional Silent Hill gameplay. Instead of the tense exploration and survival horror elements, the game adopts an interactive storytelling approach. Viewers engage with the story through a mobile app or the official website, making decisions that impact the direction of the narrative.\r\nThe gameplay, if it can be called that, involves participation in daily puzzles, minigames, and quick-time events. These activities are designed to earn \"influence points\" which are then used to vote on narrative outcomes. The choices viewers make are themed around three paths: Suffering, Redemption, and Damnation, which influence the story's direction.\r\nHowever, it's essential to understand that the gameplay is minimal compared to traditional video games. Ascension leans more toward an episodic streaming experience, with the interactive elements serving as a way to engage the audience and influence the story's progression. 5-10 minute scenes release on a daily basis, which forms the on-going story of the game, that is expected to take months to conclude.\r\n## 📺Presentation\r\nThe series unfolds like a traditional television show, with episodes released periodically. Scenes release on a daily basis, which is then forms into a weekly episode that is planned to span up to six months. However, the defining feature is the optional real-time interactivity, where viewers play an active role in determining the story's direction.\r\nEvery scene is live-streamed, creating an immersive experience where viewers can participate in the story's evolution. The use of an official site and mobile app facilitates engagement, allowing users to make decisions and interact with other viewers.\r\nThe format also includes a live chat box, chat emotes, stickers, avatars, leaderboards, and contribution histories, fostering a sense of community among viewers which will look very similar to Twitch’s format. There's also the interesting feature that lets participants enter a daily contest to have their custom avatars featured in the series, which adds a layer of personal involvement, for those who are willing to spend money on microtransactions.\r\n## 🕹Interactivity and Choices\r\nInteractivity and choices are at the core of Silent Hill: Ascension's appeal. Viewers earn \"influence points\" through daily puzzles and minigames, and these points are used to vote on narrative outcomes. It's a novel approach that empowers the audience to influence the story direction. The fact that viewers can collectively dictate the story's path is both unique and challenging.\r\nThe game's interactivity revolves around collective decision-making. Character fates are determined by the choices made by the community, and the aggregate vote determines the canonical scenario. These choices are boiled down to three color coded paths: Redemption, Suffering and Damnation, which will provide different results.\r\nEach scene culminates with a quick-time event, where participants must act within a limited timeframe to assist a character. If enough of the audience fails to act, the character suffers a dire consequence.\r\nWhile this approach adds a layer of unpredictability, it also limits the individual's ability to directly impact the narrative. The decisions are ultimately based on the majority vote, and even purchasing \"influence points\" doesn't guarantee the outcome you desire. This may frustrate players who are used to more agency and freedom in interactive storytelling.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game relies on the sale of \"Influence Points\" which then can be used to enter contests, buy avatars, and, more importantly, influence the narrative. It's a monetization model that aligns with modern gaming trends but may raise concerns for those who prefer a more traditional approach to storytelling. On one hand, the game is entirely free-to-play. On the other hand, the narrative weirdly becomes pay-to-win.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nSilent Hill: Ascension is a bold and and intriguing experiment that attempts to capitalize on Silent Hill’s name, but ultimately does more harm than good to the franchise. It offers a unique and communal experience for viewers but it doesn’t fully capture the essence of the Silent Hill franchise to begin with. Despite it’s best efforts, the story is unengaging, and the inability to affect the narrative in a much more personal way is a big issue for interactive storytelling.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6517006) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The franchise is kicking ass on practically all fronts, beating the likes of big mixed-media IPs like Star Wars and Marvel in pumping out video game content. Now, we are taking a look at Warhammer 40,000: Warpforge.\r\nWarhammer 40,000: Warpforge is a digital collectible card battler set in the grimdark future of the 41st millennium. It's a game that allows players to step into the war-torn universe of Warhammer 40k and engage in strategic card battle. It carries the rich lore and factions of the Warhammer universe and uses it as a basis to create a card battler game.\r\nThe game, currently in soft launch for Android, iOS, and PC, offers a blend of strategic card combat and a deep connection to the Warhammer 40k lore. Players can assemble decks based on their chosen faction and engage in battles that capture the essence of the tabletop experience.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful to the Warhammer 40k universe\r\n- Addicting card battler gameplay with dual-attribute ranged/melee attacks\r\n- Faction-based playstyles and mechanics\r\n- High-quality card art and solid visuals\r\n## Cons\r\n- Some balancing work needs to be done\r\n- Missing some QOL features\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nWarhammer 40,000: Warpforge immerses players in the dark, dystopian future of the Warhammer 40k universe. It presents a variety of factions, each with its own distinctive playstyle and mechanics that stay true to the tabletop game's lore. This deep connection to the source material is undoubtedly one of the game's strong points. Whether you're a die-hard Warhammer fan or just someone looking for an engaging card game, Warpforge offers an intriguing premise.\r\nThe game showcases a range of factions, including the hulking Space Marines, the chaotic forces of Chaos, the brutal Orks, the mysterious Eldar, the ancient Necrons, and the terrifying Tyranids. Each faction feels like a faithful representation of its tabletop counterpart, complete with unique abilities and playstyles. While some fan-favorite factions are understandably missing, the existing roster provides a diverse and satisfying gameplay experience already, with room to grow.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nIn terms of aesthetic presentation, Warpforge delivers solid visuals for a card battler game on PC and especially on mobile. The card art features striking and detailed designs that evoke the grim atmosphere of the Warhammer 40k universe and doesn’t over do it. It captures the essence of the source material just right.\r\nThe game's environments featuring a mix of 2D and 3D elements that are presented in a 2.5D style. This approach distinguishes Warpforge from other card battlers with abstract or static backgrounds. The overall graphics and art style contribute to the immersive Warhammer 40k experience.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nWarpforge effectively implements well-established concepts in the collectible card game genre. The core gameplay revolves around energy management, where players must carefully allocate their energy to play cards. More powerful cards require more energy, and the energy pool increases incrementally and replenishes each turn, resulting in more chaos as the battle wages on. This basic mechanic adds a layer of strategy and entropy as players must make decisions on card selection based on the available energy. Energy is replenished to the current maximum at every turn, so players are encouraged to maximize all their points at every turn.\r\nIn Warpforge, the cards in the game are not limited to a single attack stat; they have two: melee and ranged. This dual-attribute system adds a significant layer of strategic complexity to the game. It forces players to carefully evaluate their moves and make tactical decisions based on the positioning and the types of attacks each card in their hand can deliver. For example, If your opponent’s card has a weak ranged attack, strategically using your unit's ranged attack against it would yield maximum effectiveness.\r\nThe diverse range of factions offers a varied and strategic gameplay experience. The factions aren’t just reskins of each other with different card designs and effects. They fundamentally work differently. Each faction stays true to its lore and tabletop design. For example, Saim-Hann uses spirit stones to save the souls of fallen cards and even summon wraithguards. Another example is the Necrons, with their ability to bring cards back to life.\r\nHowever, the game isn’t without its issues. I feel that it still needs more balancing regarding cards’ health points and damages, especially that cards, specifically weak ones are often eliminated as soon as they are played. Since most played cards cannot attack until the next turn, this means that many cards WILL come and go without even doing anything meaningful to the match.\r\nThe game is also brutally difficult to master. It took me a lot of losses before I was able to come up with my first win. I think it’s safe to say that I was already playing with real players even at my first match, that or the starting bots are too advanced for beginners.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nPerformance-wise, the game is stable and playable, but there are a couple of UI and interface quirks that I've experienced, such as the settings button being on the edgemost part of the screen, which is prone to accidental touches, and dragging cards being a little too sensitive, etc. Nothing game-breaking, and no crashes. The game though is in dire need of QOL(Quality of Life) improvements, such as the ability to skip the opening of booster packs, skipping the dialogue, and perhaps decreasing the timer of turns to help liven up to pacing of matches.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nThe game features two main game modes. Multiplayer Mode is the standard game mode where players face off along with their built Decks against their online opponents in head-to-head card battles, it comes with a ranked and unranked game mode.\r\nThe other game mode is Draft: players construct their decks from a limited pool of cards. This process requires careful consideration of card synergies, strategy, and the composition of the final deck. Once decks are constructed, players enter battles or tournaments using the decks they've drafted. The opponents have also drafted their decks in a similar fashion. Draft Mode introduces an extra layer of strategy as players must adapt to the cards they receive during the draft, and is probably my preferred game mode, as it adds another layer of strategic and evens up the playing field even more.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nWarpforge introduces a progression system that revolves around faction-specific campaigns that fundamentally function as battle passes. Each faction has its currency, earned through gameplay and continuous matches, and used to progress along a branching timeline AKA a battle pass progrsesion. These campaigns grant rewards, such as booster packs, unique cards, and other in-game currencies. It's a structured system that keeps players engaged and motivated to explore different factions.\r\nIn addition to faction-specific currency, there's an earnable currency of pink crystals, which can be used to purchase or upgrade individual cards. Another currency, grey crystals, can be obtained by completing daily challenges and is used for a draft mode with premium rewards.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe presence of a premium currency, Gold, is where the game's monetization strategy becomes apparent. Gold can be used to buy boosters and cosmetics, but they come at a price. Some items like card backs and avatars can be relatively expensive. The game encourages players to spend real money to expedite their progress or access premium items.\r\nBooster packs, crucial for deck building, can be challenging to obtain through free means. Battle rewards might feel a bit stingy, and choosing boosters can result in missing out on other rare items from the battle pass. While there's an option to upgrade to the premium track, it comes with its cost, adding to the overall expense of the game. Still, I would say the free-to-play experience is highly enjoyable and you can find yourself playing a long time even without spending money.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWarhammer 40,000: Warpforge is a game that successfully translates the Warhammer 40k experience into collectible card combat. With its unique factions and mechanics that faithfully represent the tabletop counterparts, it is a compelling choice for those looking to try a new card game, and perhaps a must-try for fans of both the franchise and the card battler genre.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6517710) Originally posted on TapTap.",

However, Teyon and Nacon aren't your typical companies. Fortunately, they understandably want to capitalize on the coolness of '80s action movies, having previously delivered the mildly excellent Terminator: Resistance in 2019. And now, we have RoboCop: Rogue City.\r\nThe graphics, powered by Unreal Engine 5, exhibit a somewhat high level of fidelity and realism. However, upon closer examination, the character models and textures give off a distinct PS3-era vibe. It's as if they've been ported into Unreal Engine 5 in an attempt to modernize them. Instead, the game feels more like an HD remaster of a non-existent PS3-era title. Interestingly, The developer’s previous game: Terminator: Resistance, look just about the same in terms of graphical fidelity. Nonetheless, the game remarkably captures the essence of the late 1980s, even with its modern graphics engine.\r\nThe gameplay offers unadulterated fun, as you charge into missions with guns blazing, mowing down foes without a care in the world. The destructible environment enhances this feeling, taking the experience to new heights. You genuinely feel like an unstoppable killing machine, or, in this case, like RoboCop.\r\nThe game truly shines when you're engaged in missions where you're taking down adversaries. However, in between them, during the rather boring police station scenes and dialogue segments, the game still has a certain charm and comical moments that serve as a short reprieve from the relentless action, although I wouldn't miss them if they weren't in the game.\r\nAs you progress through the game and level up, you'll unlock new skill perks and upgrades that result in new abilities. This progression system adds to the overall enjoyment, providing more and more ways to gratifyingly eliminate the bad guys as you go deeper in the game's story.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6518884) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Call of Duty campaigns have consistently been celebrated as exceptional single-player experiences, distinct and detached from the intense multiplayer gameplay for which the franchise is also renowned for. These campaigns offer players a gripping narrative, often set in diverse and immersive environments, replete with cinematic moments and heart-pounding action. They serve as an excellent showcase of the franchise's dedication to delivering compelling storytelling, character development, and thrilling set pieces.\r\nWell, with this year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III , it's unfortunate to see that the campaign has not lived up to the high standards set by its predecessors.\r\nThe story opens strong with Operation 627, a stealth mission into a gulag, reminiscent of the iconic Captain Price rescue mission from the original Modern Warfare 2. It sets the stage for that familiar traditional Call of Duty campaign experience, but then afterwards immediately sidetracks us to semi open world Warzone-esque missions that never reaches the same level of excitement as traditional Call of Duty missions.\r\nThese Warzone-esque missions are called \"Open Combat\" missions, which aims to allow players more freedom to complete objectives, including looting around containers and manning vehicles. While this is a novel integration of Warzone’s mechanics into the campaign, it disrupts the game's pacing, leading to a disjointed narrative that struggles to maintain cinematic tension.\r\nWhat's worse than Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's lack of a campaign? It’s Modern Warfare III’s campaign that has truly lost the soul and depth of the franchise. Sledgehammer Games dropped the ball on this one, likely because MWIII was released just one year after MWII, breaking from the usual three-year development cycle, which didn’t leave a lot of time for development.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6519268) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "9.0\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nDeveloped by Teyon and published by Nacon, RoboCop: Rogue City brings the iconic RoboCop with a blend of nostalgia and modern gaming elements. As a fan of the 1987 action film and someone with a penchant for action-packed shooters, I found myself excited to dive into this title, which promised to capture the essence of the late 1980s while leveraging Unreal Engine 5's graphical prowess.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fun and gratifying combat\r\n- Destructible environments\r\n- Captures the tone of the original RoboCop film\r\n- Progression system that keeps the gameplay fresh## Cons\r\n-Weak story, pacing, and side content\r\n-Dated graphics and AI\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet between the events of \"RoboCop 2\" and \"RoboCop 3,\" it explores the story of the titular cyborg, Alex Murphy, as he confronts a new wave of criminal activity in Detroit. The game's premise is intriguing, it offers an extended take on the RoboCop universe, but its nothing special or groundbreaking.\r\nA mysterious figure known as \"The New Guy\" rallies Detroit's top gangs, creating chaos in the city. The police force, under the control of Omni Consumer Products (OCP), is struggling to maintain order, leading to a complex web of challenges for RoboCop. As a player, you'll navigate through various story threads, including aiding a snooping journalist, attending therapy sessions, and partnering with a new recruit who is also an OCP informant. The story isn’t the game’s strongest suit, and is mostly an excuse for Alex to mow down foe after foe.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe game's graphics, powered by Unreal Engine 5, offer a mix of high fidelity and dated visuals. While the character models and textures appear somewhat outdated, it's clear that the developers aimed to enhance them with modern technology. Unfortunately, this approach results in a feeling that the game's assets were ported from the PS3 era into Unreal Engine 5. In essence, it feels like an HD remaster of a non-existent PS3-era game. The developer’s previous game: Terminator: Resistance, look just about the same in terms of graphical fidelity.\r\nHowever, despite these graphical limitations, \"RoboCop: Rogue City\" effectively recreates the gritty and glossy plastic look of the original film. Environments maintain the grime and style of the late 80s.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay and Combat\r\nThe core experience of playing as RoboCop is exhilarating, and the game's action sequences are undeniably fun. Charging headlong into battle, guns blazing and foes falling, makes you feel like an unstoppable killing machine, a true RoboCop.\r\nThe combat system is simple, yet satisfying. Playing on normal difficulty, I didn't need to worry much about taking cover or dodging bullets, as RoboCop is built to withstand a hail of gunfire. Mowing down adversaries with sheer firepower is incredibly gratifying. While the AI of your foes leaves something to be desired, their often comical interactions provide some amusement.\r\nThe destructible environment adds an extra layer of enjoyment. It propels the feeling of being an unstoppable force, capable of tearing through anything in your path. Blasting through walls, creating chaos in the environment, and watching the world crumble around you is pure exhilaration.\r\nWhile RoboCop's signature sidearm, with unlimited ammo, is a reliable tool, the game offers a variety of firearms. Automatic weapons provide a satisfying kick, but shotguns and sniper rifles are less compelling. However, enemy AI falls short in terms of intelligence, often standing in place, struggling with cover, or, occasionally, even harming each other in the chaos.\r\nAll in all, the combat in RoboCop: Rogue City is like a power fantasy come to life. RoboCop is a formidable figure who can absorb bullets and march through enemy fire with confidence. Taking out adversaries is a blast, and there's a certain joy in popping off headshots while strolling through a hail of bullets. The game manages to balance RoboCop's power by introducing tougher challenges in the form of larger enemy numbers and stronger weaponry during boss battles.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nWhile RoboCop: Rogue City remembers what made games fun with all the power fantasy of being Robocop it gives you, it does not double down on it and instead opted to modernize the gameplay with RPG-like mechanics. It incorporates a progression system that enhances the gameplay experience. As you level up, you unlock new skill perks and upgrades that provide new abilities and tools to deal with enemies. This gradual growth keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting, offering a sense of advancement as you play.\r\nThe skill points can be allocated to various traits, such as Combat, Armor, Engineering, and Deduction. These traits offer unique perks that add depth to combat and exploration. For example, you can increase your mobility, or perhaps you’d prefer more survivability. These skill choices provide players with the opportunity to tailor their playstyle and approach to the game.\r\nThere is also some decision-driven dialogue that presents opportunities to shape RoboCop's character. Players can choose to adhere strictly to the law or adopt a more friendly approach. The decisions you make influence the story's direction and can lead to multiple endings, providing a minor sense of freedom in the game's narrative.\r\nThe game is at its best when you are shooting people in missions. However, in between them, during the rather boring police station scenes and dialogue segments, the game still has a certain charm and comical moments that serve as a short reprieve from the relentless action, although I wouldn't miss them if they weren't in the game.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6518907) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III marks the continuation of the rebooted Modern Warfare series and picks up the story where the previous game, Modern Warfare II, left off. Developed by Sledgehammer Games, Modern Warfare III aimed to blend the best of Call of Duty's past with innovative new elements, such as the integration of Call of Duty: Warzone into its gameplay.\r\nCall of Duty campaigns have consistently been celebrated as exceptional single-player experiences, distinct and detached from the intense multiplayer gameplay for which the franchise is also renowned for. These campaigns offer players a gripping narrative, often set in diverse and immersive environments, replete with cinematic moments and heart-pounding action. They serve as an excellent showcase of the franchise's dedication to delivering compelling storytelling, character development, and thrilling set pieces.\r\nWell, this year, it's unfortunate to see that the campaign has not lived up to the high standards set by its predecessors, especially in this era of $70 AAA games. What's worse than Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's lack of a campaign? It’s Modern Warfare III’s campaign that has truly lost the soul and depth of the franchise. Sledgehammer Games dropped the ball on this one, likely because MWIII was released just one year after MWII, breaking from the usual three-year development cycle., which didn’t leave a lot of time for development.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Impressive visuals and audio design\r\n- Smooth performance\r\n- Best-in-class FPS gunplay## Cons\r\n- Campaign plays like solo Warzone training/tutorial missions instead of true Call of Duty missions\r\n- Mission structure and story feels uninspired, missing the usual blockbuster-like set pieces\r\n- Overuses the Verdansk map, which perhaps is the most overused region in Call of Duty history\r\n## ⭐️Score: 3/10\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nAs usual, Modern Warfare III impresses with its graphics and art style. Gone are the days where COD has been consistently mocked for its aging Graphics when compared to its competitors. The game's visuals are sharp and detailed, offering a level of realism that enhances the overall experience. The environments are well-crafted, from the dark, rainy gulag to Verdansk's mountainous environment. Character models are lifelike, and the game's presentation when it comes to cutscenes and storytelling is top-tier.\r\n## 📖Story and Missions\r\nModern Warfare III's story continues the saga of Captain Price's Task Force 141, who are now up against the major antagonist, Vladimir Makarov, from the original Modern Warfare franchise. The premise holds promise as it introduces Makarov as a ruthless extremist, presenting a direct threat to the world.\r\nThe story opens strong with Operation 627, a stealth mission into a gulag, reminiscent of the iconic Captain Price rescue mission from the original Modern Warfare 2. It sets the stage for that familiar traditional Call of Duty campaign experience, but then afterwards immediately sidetracks us to semi open world Warzone-esque missions that never reaches the same level of excitement as traditional Call of Duty missions.\r\nThese Warzone-esque missions are called \"Open Combat\" missions, which aims to allow players more freedom to complete objectives, including looting around containers and manning vehicles. While this is a novel integration of Warzone’s mechanics into the campaign, it disrupts the game's pacing, leading to a disjointed narrative that struggles to maintain cinematic tension.\r\nPlayers can embark on a stealthy incursion through a military base as Kate Laswell or participate in a bomb-defusing mission on a bridge as Ghost. These missions rely heavily on the novelty of Warzone's Verdansk map, which perhaps is the most overused map in Call of Duty history, despite it being removed from Warzone last 2021.\r\nThe game also revisits a controversial mission similar to \"No Russian,\" where you're placed in the middle of a terrorist attack. While this mission aims to be impactful and shocking like the original, it feels significantly inferior to the original.\r\nThe campaign is very short, and can easily be finished in under 4 hours in Normal difficulty. Overall, there's a lack of variety in enemy encounters, and the absence of iconic Call of Duty mission types, such as high-speed vehicle chases, huge action-packed set pieces, and stealthy sniper sessions, are missed dearly. This is a deja vu all over again with Battlefield V’s similarly lame take on its singleplayer campaign, before ultimately getting cut off in their next game Battlefield 2042.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nJust like modern Call of Duty games that started with the Modern Warfare reboot, the gunplay is smooth, responsive, and satisfying. You feel like in total control of you character, with high mobility and responsive controls, the immersive sound design and excellent positional audio adds to the overall immersion.\r\nThe aforementioned Open Combat missions aim to provide more player choice, but they compromise the traditional Call of Duty formula. While these missions offer freedom, they come at the cost of cinematic tension and atmosphere. It feels like I was still playing Warzone, instead of a action-packed Call of Duty campaign experience. This game is absolutely the peak Warzone influence that it even affected the campaign. The focus on integrating Warzone overshadows the mission's core gameplay, making them feel more like a marketing tie-in or Training missions rather than integral components of the campaign.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game's graphics settings provide flexibility for PC gamers to adjust according to their hardware, with support for DLSS and is well optimized. I was able to run the game smoothly on my aging i7-8700k CPU paired with an RTX 3080. Although the game is quite annoying at first, requiring multiple restarts, initial long loading times, and shader cache updates to fully initialize the newly downloaded game.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe multiplayer and Warzone are undoubtedly going to be hits as always, but the campaign for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III falls short of the high expectations set by its blockbuster predecessors. While it boasts impressive graphics, sound design, and the signature fast-paced gunplay of the series, it suffers from major shortcomings. It’s perhaps the worst Call of Duty campaign I’ve EVER played, period.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6519285) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Warhammer 40,000: Warpforge is a digital collectible card battler set in the grimdark future of the 41st millennium. It's a game that allows players to step into the war-torn universe of Warhammer 40k and engage in strategic card battle. It carries the rich lore and factions of the Warhammer universe and uses it as a basis to create a card battler game.\r\nThe game, currently in soft launch for Android, iOS, and PC, offers a blend of strategic card combat and a deep connection to the Warhammer 40k lore. Players can assemble decks based on their chosen faction and engage in battles that capture the essence of the tabletop experience.\r\nWarpforge effectively implements well-established concepts in the collectible card game genre. The core gameplay revolves around energy management, where players must carefully allocate their energy to play cards. More powerful cards require more energy, and the energy pool increases incrementally and replenishes each turn, resulting in more chaos as the battle wages on.\r\nThe cards in the game are not limited to a single attack stat; they have two: melee and ranged. This dual-attribute system adds a significant layer of strategic complexity to the game. The diverse range of factions also offers a varied and strategic gameplay experience. The factions aren’t just reskins of each other with different card designs and effects. They fundamentally work differently.\r\nHowever, the game isn’t without its issues. I feel that it still needs more balancing regarding cards’ health points and damages, especially that cards, especially weak ones are often eliminated as soon as they are played. Since most played cards cannot attack until the nxet turn, this means that many cards WILL come and go without even doing anything meaningful to the match.\r\nThe game is also brutally difficult to master. It took me a lot of losses before I was able to come up with my first win. I think it’s safe to safe that I was already playing with real players even at my first match, that or the starting bots are too advanced for beginners.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6517709) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nMetria, an action RPG that first caught my attention during its testing phases in June and July, has finally made its global debut on November 7. This game showcases a vibrant, anime-inspired world with promises of hack and slash third-person combat.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Promising storyline\r\n- Vibrant art style\r\n## Cons\r\n- Performance issues\r\n- Broken monster spawns\r\n- Stiff combat\r\n- Uninspired mission design\r\n- Lots of loading screens\r\n- Lots of running around to do anything and repetitive fetch quests\r\n## ⭐️Score: 3/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe storyline in Metria, even during the Alpha phase, intrigued me the most. It drew me in with its captivating narrative, starting with a daring escape from a burning castle involving main characters Rio, Lucas, and the princess. The intrigue didn't stop there, as the story quickly took unexpected turns, making it stand out among contemporaries in the action RPG genre.\r\nThere is no voice acting for all the dialogues, which made the animation filled cutscenes feel oddly silent. It felt like the foundation was laid for voiceacting with how the scenes are played out but the implementation was cancelled.\r\nFurthermore, the dialogue presentation has its quirks, with unnatural pauses and sometimes odd text bubble placement, sometimes even putting the last word all alone into the next bubble. These issues affect the pacing of dialogues, which could be more polished. Despite these early issues, the storyline held promise.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nMetria's graphics and art style are defined by its cel-shaded, anime-inspired visuals. The game is presented with a colorful and vibrant world. However, it was evident that it lagged behind other high-end titles in terms of graphical fidelity, but its mostly serviceable and can even pass as a beautiful game.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nMetria primarily plays as a third-person hack-and-slash action RPG with seamless character switching, with a party of three. The game features traditional character tropes, each with their unique skills and playstyles, such as swordsmen, spearmen, mages, healers, and archers. There are two skills and one ultimate, all of which recharges without the need for mana. Players are to explore a world subdivided into small regions, and take on various quests to progress.\r\nYou can also engage in mundane tasks reminiscent of survival games, such as gathering flora, chopping down trees, and even fishing. These activities are used to craft armor for defense, prepare meals that temporarily boost your character's stats, or even build and upgrade facilities like blacksmiths. However, navigating the various activities at the home base can become tedious, as it involves a lot of walking, animations, and frequent loading screens, even for simple tasks like crafting. Implementing a simple menu system for these minor elements should be sufficient.\r\nIn addition to the general open-ish world questing and material crafting, players can also participate in extra content like the Level of Trials: a repeatable dungeon crawling element with daily rewards.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat system in Metria, however, is one of its weakest points. It felt stiff, with unresponsive controls and animations that lacked fluidity and coherence. However, it compensated for these issues with flashy and over-the-top moves and skills, which are typical of hack-and-slash RPGs.  The combat system has seen some improvements in the global release but still carries the mark of stiffness.\r\n## 📜Mission Design\r\nThe mission design in Metria is simply lackluster; everything feels uninspired, from the fetch quests to the main quests, which involves a lot of back-and-forth interactions with NPCs. Most of the quests I've encountered revolve around talking to an NPC, then reporting back to another, followed by more dialogue with additional characters, all oddly silent due to the lack of voice-overs. This results in extensive running around across the map, populated by neutral monsters that do not pose a threat. Multiple loading screens further contribute to the tedium of these interactions. It's a rather uninteresting experience.\r\nIf you decide to engage the wandering neutral creatures in combat, you'll indeed find some much needed action, but it quickly becomes apparent that the spawn mechanism for many monsters is broken. They respawn almost immediately after being defeated, making it impossible to clear areas of monsters, and make you feel like what you’re doing is totally worthless. This also creates an exploitable situation, as you can endlessly farm monsters in the same area since they continuously respawn.\r\nOne of the few enjoyable aspects of the game so far is the challenging boss fights, which require skill and strategy to beat. However, players may feel restricted by power level limitations as early as their first few hours of play, which can create pressure to utilize the gacha mechanics and spend real money to make progress. ## ⏫Progression and Gacha\r\nThe game features a gacha mechanic for character acquisition and Tarots, which enhance characters in which up to four per character can be equipped. This mechanic may feel necessary for progression, which is a common mechanic in gacha-based games. Banners for characters and Tarots are separate, allowing players to focus on specific aspects of their character lineup. There are also familiar live-service features like login bonuses, passes, and in-game currency to purchase in the store.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nTechnical performance was a concern in both the Alpha and global release. The Alpha version experienced lag and performance issues, even on a device with the Snapdragon 888 chipset and with many of my settings set to low. Considering that the visuals are not on par with best-in-class games like Genshin Impact, this was unexpected. Additionally, there were graphical issues, and the user interface (UI) had an early 2000s aesthetic. In the global release, performance has improved slightly but still lags during large battles, even on high-end devices. Even the gacha draw animation also suffers from lag.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nMetria is a game with a promising storyline, but it ultimately gets bogged down by technical issues, uninspired mission design, stiff combat, and a general lack of polish. While the global release has seen some improvements, Metria still doesn't feel fully ready for prime time. Players seeking a polished and well-rounded gaming experience may need to wait for future updates and improvements to fully enjoy what Metria has to offer.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6522696) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Lost Future: Zombie Survival\r\n7.4\r\nPost-apocalyptic\r\nAction\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nLost Future is a mobile third-person zombie survival game that recently launched and is now available for both Android and iOS platforms. It features a post-apocalyptic setting overrun by zombies, where they must explore, survive, and uncover the mysteries of a semi-futuristic Earth.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Decent visuals\r\n- Post apocalyptic open world gameplay\r\n- Base management elements\r\n- Seamless character switching## Cons\r\n-Gunplay is clunky and buggy\r\n-Sluggish performance with no way to change the graphics settings\r\n-Lots of model and texture pop-ins\r\n-Repetitive animations\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nLost Future transports players to a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2035, where Earth has been overtaken by zombies. Set in a semi-futuristic environment driven by AI, cryptocurrency, and advanced 3D printing technology, the game's narrative is a compelling tale of survival, mystery, and exploration.\r\nOne of the game's standout features is its exceptional worldbuilding. The post-apocalyptic setting is richly detailed and believable, offering a glimpse into a world where technology and civilization have collapsed, giving way to the undead menace. The story revolves around a group of survivors striving to survive all while unveil the mysteries of this grim future. The characters are well-crafted and possess unique charming personalities.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nIt isn’t the most beautiful looking game, but there is merit in saying the game has console level visuals. The models, textures and animations are detailed enough. Honestly, the lines are blurred nowadays, with mobile phones getting more powerful everyday. The game reeks of high production values, the voice acting is superb and sounds AAA-like.\r\nThe voice acting stands out as being of high-quality, providing an almost AAA-like experience. An interesting detail worth noting is how the game handles character dialogue and distances. When characters are close to each other, their voices sound natural, but when you move away from the NPC you're talking to or switch characters, a radio filter is applied to those characters speaking but not present in the scene, enhancing the game's immersion.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay of Lost Future centers around a post-apocalyptic open world filled with various activities and challenges. Players will engage in melee combat, shooting, stealth takedowns on zombies, and looting for essential supplies.  The vibe of the game feels very similar to one of my favorite zombie games, State of Decay. Lost Future also features base management elements, where you can build new facilities within your safehouse and upgrade them for more benefit. As far as mobile games go, it may remind you of games like LifeAfter and Last Day on Earth: Survival.\r\nLost Future also implements seamless character swapping, a feature originally popularized by Genshin Impact. It can be somewhat immersion-breaking, as characters abruptly switch places like schizophrenics with multiple personality disorders, but that's how the game is, and it's still still better than having a lone character roaming around. . Nevertheless, I wish had all three characters be on the world simultaneously together like in other games. It’s definitely doable and would feel much more immersive.\r\nThe three characters don't differ significantly from each other, with most of the differences arising from the weapons and gear they equip. These choices result in distinct movesets and damage levels. For example, a baseball bat can easily knock down enemies and even has an area-of-effect swing attack, while a machete excels at dealing massive damage per hit.\r\nThe zombies in this game are formidable and challenging to take down, particularly when encountered in groups. This isn't an action-packed horde shooter like Left 4 Dead. Instead, you must avoid zombies as much as possible to conserve your ammo and ensure maximum survivability. Throughout the game, you'll explore the open world, loot resources from key buildings and houses, all while working to build your safehouse and progressing through the main quest.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat system in \"Lost Future\" is a mixed bag. Melee combat is generally solid, with hits that feel weighty and responsive controls. The melee attacks automatically snap to enemies, increasing accuracy, but this can also lead to unintended targets being hit, disrupting the flow. Unfortunately, melee attacks lack variety, with only one animation per weapon type, potentially making combat feel repetitive even a few minutes in.\r\nOn the other hand, gunplay is a significant weak point of the game. The decision to use an ADS (Aiming Down Sights) mechanic in a first-person view is questionable and results in inconsistent camera views, causing confusion and control issues. Additionally, I’ve encountered bugs can disrupt the camera view, adding to the clunkiness. Overall, the gunplay is clunky and buggy.\r\nStealth mechanics in the game are well-implemented. Players can perform stealth takedowns that rely on both visibility and sound, offering a satisfying way to eliminate zombies in one-hit, silently.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nLost Future features a progression system that revolves around enhancing your safehouse and character capabilities. Players can build and upgrade facilities in their safehouse, which provides various benefits, contributing to the overall survival and resource management aspect of the game. Progression is tied to the main quest, as players explore the open world, loot resources, and tackle challenges.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game is completely free-to-play and monetization comes in the form of weapon and item packs, which shamelessly pop-ups in the game from time to time. Ammunition being sold at the in-game store is ridiculously expensive, even when real money is used. For example, a roughly $30 pack gives you an armor, 3 weapons and  around 100 rifle rounds, 100 9mm rounds, and 50 shotgun rounds.\r\nOverall, the game's monetization strategy relies on in-game purchases which is pressured on the player, especially with how difficult surviving in the game can be, a common approach for free-to-play mobile games. Players can choose whether or not to invest in these purchases, but the cost of some items may be prohibitive for some players.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWhile Lost Future offers impressive graphics and visuals, its performance is a bit sluggish, at least with my experience on a Snapdragon 888 device.There is literally no way to adjust graphics settings to at least optimize my performance by my own.\r\nIn addition to performance issues, there are noticeable model and texture pop-ins that can affect the overall gaming experience. Players may also observe aliasing and jagged edges in the visual fidelity, which, while not game-breaking, can detract from the immersion. Also, the aforementioned bugs regarding camera, as some as some minor animation breaking are present.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nLost Future is a mobile zombie survival game with a rich post-apocalyptic setting, decent console-level visuals and likeable characters. However, the game is marred by technical issues and general clunkiness. The combat system, while offering solid melee combat, struggles with clunky and buggy gunplay. The performance is sluggish, and there isn't even a way to adjust the graphics settings. If these issues are remedied, then this game would jump from a 6/10 to a solid 8/10 for me.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6524434) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Tokyo Ghoul: Break the Chains\r\nRPG\r\nStrategy\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nTokyo Ghoul: Break the Chains is a mobile 3D turn-based strategy card game that combines iconic scenes from the original anime with a turn-based card battle system, and it offers players the chance to interact with their favorite characters from the series, and relive iconic moments from the story.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Impressive visuals\r\n- Smooth performance\r\n- Engaging card-based combat## Cons\r\n-Underwhelming story presentation\r\n-Sound desync issues\r\n-Imbalanced pacing and progression\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nTokyo Ghoul: Break the Chains recreates the dark and gritty world of Tokyo Ghoul. The story revolves around Ken Kaneki, a college student who, after a chance encounter with a Ghoul, undergoes a transformation into a half-Ghoul, half-human hybrid. He is thrust into the dangerous and hidden world of Ghouls, supernatural beings that consume human flesh.\r\nThe game does an okay job of capturing the essence of the original series, and it delivers a plot that fans know and love. During cutscenes in the story chapters, the game uses a manga-style graphic novel panel presentation to tell the story, with some panels being animated.\r\nHowever, there is no background music in some scenes, and despite many of the original voice actors returning, there is no voice-overs in these story cutscenes, so you'd have to read all the dialogue. This isn't a problem, especially if you're a manga enthusiast. Personally, I found it somewhat underwhelming and half-baked compared to other anime/manga mobile games with story adaptations that provide a more comprehensive audiovisual experience in this regard.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay of Tokyo Ghoul: Break the Chains revolves around turn-based card battles. Cards are randomly drawn for the player depending on their character roster, and use them strategically in battles. The game offers more than 30 characters to choose from, allowing players to create their own powerful lineup.\r\nThe combat system in Tokyo Ghoul: Break the Chains is reminiscent of the popular game \"Seven Deadly Sins\" in terms of card combining and turn-based combat. Each turn, you have a set amount of energy to spend. You can use it to draw cards, move cards around, or use an energy card to replenish your ultimate skill. Identical adjacent cards will automatically combine and will result in more powerful version of the card.\r\nIt’s a pretty straight forward mechanic, and one that’s engaging. The effects are pretty cool too, although they will get repetitive since the all characters only have one main attack. You can speed up the battles, with the option for Automation unlocked further in the game.\r\nOne neat thing I loved about it is the simple information panels that appears when skills are activated, which helps alot in learning the different characters and their attacks, no need to hold press them or read them in another menu.\r\nPerhaps the combat system is the most interesting part of the game. However, when playing the main story chapters, the battle’s are few and far in between, and it mostly focuses on the pretty underwhelming cutscenes that take up most of the chapters.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe main source of progression is leveling up your profile, and advancing the main story. You'll go back and forth between enhancing your characters' power by using materials and equipping cells; and trying to gain EXP to level up your profile. However, I found the pacing of progression a bit slow and imbalanced. The level requirements for the main story chapters are widely spaced, forcing you to play a lot of the extra content to access the next chapters.\r\nThese extra content can become repetitive as well, especially during the early parts when almost nothing is unlocked yet. By the time I unlocked a new chapter, I was pretty overpowered too due to all the extra “assignments” I’ve been doing repeatedly. Furthermore, many game features, such as research, autobattle, PVP, and co-op, are gated by your profile level, which takes time to increase. This means you won't have access to most of the game's content for a long time when starting out.\r\nEnergy or stamina is a key resource in the game, and it is used for almost every mission and even watching cutscenes. You have a starting limit of around 30 stamina which slowly goes up as you level up, but imagine, one mission or cutscene will already cost 10-25 stamina, which is pretty overwhelming. Mission costs can be too steep, and once your initial energy is depleted, you might find the game's energy costs overwhelming. Fortunately, the game provides a lot of stamina rewards in the early stages, but I can only imagine the costs when these bonuses are now gone.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nTokyo Ghoul: Break the Chains follows the typical free-to-play mobile game model with in-app gacha purchases that allows players to progress faster or acquire certain items by spending real money. Different banners are available, and my experience so far has been generous as I already got 3 SSR characters to use.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe visuals and effects are impressive and top-tier. In terms of performance, it's one of the smoothest games I've played on my Snapdragon 888 device. I didn't even bother checking the graphics settings because the performance was silky smooth from the outset while still looking sharp. However, the game is not perfect; I've encountered some minor bugs, such as animation and camera quirks. As good as the visuals are, I also noticed that the sound often loses sync with the gameplay.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nTokyo Ghoul: Break the Chains is a good looking turn-based card strategy game with decent combat mechanics, impressive visuals but has questionable pacing and progression issues, as well as an underwhelming execution on its storytelling presentation. Despite these drawbacks, fans of Tokyo Ghoul will find much to enjoy in this mobile adaptation, especially if those who appreciate strategic card-based combat games.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6526503) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The vibe of the game feels very similar to one of my favorite zombie games, State of Decay. Lost Future also features base management elements, where you can build new facilities within your safehouse and upgrade them for more benefit. As far as mobile games go, it may remind you of games like LifeAfter and Last Day on Earth: Survival.\r\nIt isn’t the most beautiful looking game, but there is merit in saying the game has console level visuals. The models, textures and animations are detailed enough. Honestly, the lines are blurred nowadays, with mobile phones getting more powerful everyday. The game reeks of high production values, the voice acting is superb and sounds AAA-like.\r\nLost Future also implements seamless character swapping, a feature originally popularized by Genshin Impact. It can be somewhat immersion-breaking, as characters abruptly switch places like schizophrenics with multiple personality disorders, but that's how the game is, and it's still still better than having a lone character roaming around. . Nevertheless, I wish had all three characters be on the world simultaneously together like in other games. It’s definitely doable and would feel much more immersive.\r\nThe zombies in this game are formidable and challenging to take down, particularly when encountered in groups. This isn't an action-packed horde shooter like Left 4 Dead. Instead, you must avoid zombies as much as possible to conserve your ammo and ensure maximum survivability. Throughout the game, you'll explore the open world, loot resources from key buildings and houses, all while working to build your safehouse and progressing through the main quest.\r\nHowever, the game is not without its flaws. The combat system, while offering solid melee combat, struggles with clunky and buggy gunplay. The absence of graphics settings customization and performance issues can hamper the gaming experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6524433) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Racing MasterTest SEA\r\nRacing\r\nFast-paced\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nRacing Master, a mix of arcade and realistic sim racing game, zooms onto the mobile and PC gaming scene with a Closed Regional Beta Test for the US region, this closed beta runs from November 9 to November 28, 2023, offering players a glimpse of the game before an official release. (note that beta progress will be wiped out)\r\nDeveloped by both Netease and Codemaster, it’s not surprising to see a game with this high levels of production and it clearly shows, from the graphics, presentation, and the abundance of content it brings.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nRacing Master puts players in the shoes of a new trainee driver for the Pioneer Junior, and starts the game in a so-called entrance trials. It allows players to create their own personalized characters with a character creator with the option to further customize their cosmetics going forward.\r\nYou meet Gloria, the coach of the team, along with other female characters that’s obviously entering Waifu territory, and I’m not gonna lie, I like it instead of going hyper serious about it. Honestly, the story is all about your character starting from a Junior Driver and advancing through the ranks.  It serves as a flavorful backdrop for the game, essentially an excuse to keep you racing. Despite the top-notch presentation and full voice acting, I didn't find myself compelled to invest significant attention in the narrative.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nRacing Master looks stunning and is indiscernible from a console game, except for a slight reduction in resolution quality. The quality of the cars and varied environments is highly realistic, making it arguably one of the best, if not the best, looking racing games on mobile. Even the character models are gorgeous, at times looking like its pre-rendered, though they are, in fact, just the in-game graphics. The environments range from urban cities to scenic countrysides. To further appreciate the beauty of the graphics, some game modes feature a Photo Mode that you can try—which is surprising as this feature is only usually seen in Console / PC games.\r\n## 📺Presentation\r\nFrom its lively introduction and voice-acted characters to its high quality production and impressive visuals, the presentation of this game is top-notch. At times, it felt like I was actually playing Forza Horizon on Xbox or Gran Turismo on the PS5, instead of a mobile phone game, immersing players in a console-like experience on at the palm of their hands.\r\n## 🏁Gameplay\r\nThe game is positioned as a real-time simulation racing game, but Racing Master's gameplay actually leans more towards the immersive arcade style. The handling of cars strikes a fine balance between realism and arcade fun.\r\nRaces are designed for quick, on-the-go gaming sessions, with most races lasting under three minutes. This format is perfect for on-the-go gaming and quick sessions, eliminating the need to invest a significant amount of time to play the game and race in numerous laps. Each city location, from America to Europe to Asia, is recycled to feature multiple variations of tracks. For example, Chicago has about 7 variants, ranging from long circuits to a mini track.\r\nIt's a racing game through and through. One feature I liked the most about the races is the temporary collision removal during the first few meters. Furthermore, continuous collisions will also temporarily turn off collisions. This aspect allows racers to gain momentum before engaging with other cars on the track, avoiding griefing as well. There’s no collision damage or vehicle damage model, so the cars always maintain a pristine visual appearance.\r\nThe game is playable in both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. In singleplayer, you progress through a series of story chapters and training drills, while multiplayer focuses on racing with or against other people online in ranked matches. In this game, acquiring better cars and upgrading them is essential for improved performance, and this is where the gacha system and in-game purchases comes in. Different cars have varying stats that significantly impact your performance in races.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression system in Racing Master is structured around advancing through story chapters, engaging in training drills, and competing in multiplayer ranked matches. The acquisition and enhancement of cars are central to success, introducing a gacha system and in-game purchases.  The game strikes a delicate balance, ensuring that while spending money can expedite progress, skill and strategy remain an important aspect. The variety of cars and customization options offer a sense of accomplishment as players build and evolve their dream vehicles. The monetization model revolves around in-app purchases, primarily for acquiring premium currency and items.\r\n## 🎮Controls\r\nThe game offers three control schemes: buttons, gyro controls, or virtual touch steering. It includes both auto and manual acceleration options, as well as an option to automate drift. I found that auto acceleration with manual drift provided a nice mix of fun and control, working best for my casual playstyle and likely being the more popular option for the majority. Players can also tweak the assists the game provides, from driving assists to virtual suggestion lines on the track. The game offers a plethora of accessibility options. Although if you opt to use it, you may find the driving assist occasionally fighting with your own control inputs.\r\nFor driving vehicles, the game supports physical controllers like a Dualshock or Xbox controller. However, menu and UI navigation are still done with the touchscreen.\r\n## 🔧Cars and Customization\r\nIn this game, you can collect and own nearly 100 licensed cars, including Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Porsches. Additionally, you can customize and modify aspects such as engines and tires to enhance performance or change cosmetics, part by part, to suit your preferences. Customization is a comprehensive and integral part of the game. Many cosmetics can be bought with in-game currency (Gold), while car performance mods will require some materials. Racing Master also features base management elements, including managing your headquarters, racing team, and facilities.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nDespite its impressive visuals, the game ran decently on my Snapdragon 888 device. I was able to play at medium settings and a high frame rate option, and honestly, I’m satisfied with its performance during this beta test, with some acceptable drops given the quality of the game. My only gripe is the long loading times and initializations when starting out. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement, particularly addressing occasional stutters and texture/model pop-ins.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nRacing Master delivers a balanced mix of arcade fun and immersive realism. The game's high production values, stunning graphics, and engaging gameplay make it a standout in the mobile gaming market. Even it its beta state, the game already looks and feels good. If you want a balanced mix of arcade fun and immersive realism, then Racing Master is the game for you to check out when it releases.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6534388) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Tarisland embarks on a journey to capture the magic of classic MMOs while introducing its own twists. it currently has an on-going second closed beta test that runs from November 16 and will last for at least two weeks.\r\nAs of this CBT, there are nine characters to choose from: Barbarian Fighter,  Ranger,  Paladin,  Warrior, Phantom Priest, Mage, Priest, including the two new characters for this beta test phase:  Shadow Swordsman, and Phantom Necromancer.  Which is a pretty solid class lineup so far and probably covers all bases as far as player preferences go.\r\nI was able to try both the Mage and Paladin classes, to get a feel of both the Melee and Ranged combat, so far, it really adopts a classic MMORPG style of gameplay, opting for a more grounded style of combat with moderate animations and less focus on movement.

    "body": "Tarisland\r\n6.5\r\nRPG\r\nMMORPG\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nTarisland, a highly anticipated MMORPG from developers Level Infinite and publisher Tencent, emerges as a bold contender for the next big MMO, both for Mobile and PC, which is a pretty massive undertaking.\r\nHeavily influenced by the iconic World of Warcraft, Tarisland embarks on a journey to capture the magic of classic MMOs while introducing its own twists.  Access-wise, this game has eluded me for quite some time now, and I wasn’t able to try it in the past few beta tests. Finally, with this ongoing second closed beta test that runs from November 16 and will last for at least two weeks, I have gained access and am now able to try it and share my thoughts about it.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe narrative of Tarisland unfolds in a world locked in a fierce conflict between three warring deities: Asheron, the god of disaster, Moira, the god of destiny, and the player's awakened character. Set against the backdrop of the titular planet Tarisland, the game promises an immersive experience with classic style dungeons, raids, and rich lore. Honestly, the storyline is a bit generic, but it manages to strike a balance nonetheless, offering a servicable plot for the MMORPG gameplay it sets out to do, without overwhelming players with excessive lore. The game is full voice acted, especially for the main quest dialogues, but the quality is a bit underwhelming feels amateurish in some parts.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nTarisland features stylized visuals with vibrant colors and artistic character and world design. The graphics are not hyper-realistic but instead employ a more cartoonish and exaggerated aesthetic, which helps the game run smoothly on a variety of hardware from the highest end PC to even simple smartphones. Once again, we can easily draw comparisons to World of Warcraft. However, I would argue that Tarisland has the edge here because it supports both PC and Mobile platforms simultaneously, with the extra option to look better if your hardware supports it. Well, Tarisland being 20 years younger definitely helped. Honestly, playing it on PC or mobile, both versions look good. you can pretty much switch back and forth between platforms and any changes in the fidelity wouldn't bother you.\r\nThe game’s world is vast and varied, offering a range of landscapes from lush forests and snowy mountains to barren deserts and mystical landscapes. Each zone has its own distinct atmosphere and style. The art style, character models, and visual elements maintain the same consistency, and overall, its a visually impressive title. The game successfully captures the essence that cartoonish stylized MMORPG aesthetic that creates an inviting atmosphere.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nTarisland is basically the classic MMORPG formula taken from 10, 20 years ago, infused with modern elements, and made to support Mobile. Despite its vastness, Tarisland ensures compatibility with mobile platforms, allowing players to embark on epic adventures and switch seamlessly to PC with cross progression and cross play.\r\nAs of this CBT, there are nine characters to choose from: Barbarian Fighter,  Ranger,  Paladin,  Warrior, Phantom Priest, Mage, Priest, including the two new characters:  Shadow Swordsman, and Phantom Necromancer.  Which is a pretty solid class lineup so far and probably covers all bases as far as player preferences go.\r\nI was able to try both the Mage and Paladin classes, to get a feel of the Melee and Ranged combat, so far, it really adopts a classic MMORPG style of gameplay.  Although its noteworthy to say that these classes are gender-locked as of this version, there are no male Mages, or female Warriors for example.\r\nThe introduction sequence and subsequent starting quests serve as a comprehensive tutorial, introducing players to all the features and gameplay elements of the game. These include movement, combat, mounts, exploration, questing, dungeons, raids, crafting, bosses, and even PvP.\r\nThe game seamlessly guides players through these various aspects in a natural way. For multiplayer components, it even gives you AI companions that integrate seamlessly with the story. For instance, the initial boss encounter and dungeons in the game feature AI teammates, simulating the experience of matchmaking with other players. It's a \"show, don't tell\" situation that works exceptionally well, especially for an MMORPG opting for a classic approach that might initially appear foreign to the newer generation players out there.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nTarisland's combat is not as action-packed as other modern MMOs or ARPGs out there, opting for a more grounded style of combat with moderate animations and less focus on movement. The system strikes a balance between simplicity and gradual complexity, catering to both casual and dedicated players. Target lock enemies and unleash your skill sets. Position yourself strategically, support party mates, create synergies, and exploit weaknesses.\r\nYou're free to rotate the camera, from a close-up third person view to a zoomed-out isometric style of play. It's possible. Although there is a fixed camera setting option for those who prefer it.\r\nPlayers have access to six abilities, including buffs, area-of-effect attacks, and skills that require build-up for addition bonuses, using spammable abilities with skillset-specific mechanics. For example as Frost Mage, there is a mechanic that allows me to build up a charge by continuously using my basic attack, and use that charge to augment my first skill.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nWith the nine aforementioned distinct classes, each harboring two specializations/skillsets (For example, Mage has Frost and Flame skillsets), Tarisland offers a rich progression from the get go. Talents, skills, and ultimate abilities interweave to create a dynamic character progression system, enabling players to craft avatars tailored to their preferred playstyles.\r\nThe skillset system is perhaps the defining feature of Tarisland’s progression, with two Skillsets each class, it facilitates seamless role-switching. This innovation is particularly beneficial for support players who can opt for support skills in group content and swiftly transition to a damage-focused setup for solo quests. For example, the Bard has DPS and Healer specializations, while the Barbarian has Thunder (Damage) and Frozen (Tank-CC) specializations.\r\nTarisland also features a life skill system to pursue for various in-game elements such as Jewelry, Forging, or Alchemy that allows the crafting of various items, as long as you farm for the required resources and materials.\r\nAs for the itemization, it’s pretty standard, equip more items to increase your stats, and farm for better numbers. There’s no cosmetic change when equipping new gear though, so it’s entirely possible to go from level 1 to lets say level 30, without any cosmetic changes for your character, which is a bummer for those who like to customize the appearance of their characters, but this is where monetization comes in.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nTarisland boasts a free-to-play non-P2W approach, which is a rare thing these days especially for mobile games. However, the game does include microtransactions. With real money, you can purchase Crystals, which is mostly used for cosmetics. Since the gear you earn does not affect your character's looks by itself, buying cosmetics is one of the only surefire ways to change it, and they are downright expensive at the moment.\r\nHowever, concerns arise about the potential for a pay-to-win model. Gold, another seemingly premium currency, raises questions about its role in the trade center, especially since you can definitely trade with other players for better items using this currency, and Gold can be acquired in exchange for Diamonds.\r\nThere is also a 'CBT Benefits Card' which functions similarly to a monthly sub or a season pass that can provide the player bonuses, discounts, and boosts once availed. This will probably become a Season pass offering upon release, and this is technically another form of pay-to-win especially that you can also trade for it, albeit in a relatively mild manner. The pay-to-win system isn’t exactly prominent, but it’s still there buried under extra steps.\r\nHowever, not everything here is final and all aspects are still under heavy tweaking. The game's commitment to fair and balanced gameplay, absence of pay-to-win elements, and cross-platform accessibility are highlighted, but the true impact of monetization will only become apparent when it finally releases.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nDuring this closed beta test, Tarisland demonstrated smooth performance on my Snapdragon 888 device. I was able to play it in 1080p preset settings (second to the highest), and medium setting frame rates. I tried setting it to high but the game recommended I lower it down due to heat concerns. It honestly looks impressive with the settings I played with, and perhaps one of the better games I’ve played on mobile, looks/performance wise.\r\nNo controller support so far in my testing, but I hope that will change in the future as this is one game that would benefit alot from controller as it is both for PC and Mobile, I do hope it also comes for Console too.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nTarisland presents a compelling blend of nostalgia and innovation. The game features beautiful, stylized graphics and art that are perfectly suited for a multiplatform experience on both PC and mobile. It offers abundant content, making it a worthwhile exploration for any MMORPG or even casual WoW fans. The rejection of modern MMO trends in favor of a return to the genre's roots sets Tarisland apart from contemporary titles. However this return to roots can also be its downfall in this modern era, that and it’s final monetization implementation down the line, will make or break this game upon release in the future.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6555708) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds is the latest addition to the Risk of Rain series alongside the recently released Risk of Rain Returns, it ventures into uncharted territory by bringing the beloved roguelite experience to the mobile platform.\r\nThe game retains the chaotic essence of its predecessors while introducing a fresh narrative and innovative gameplay mechanics. As players embark on a space odyssey to rescue the scattered crew of The Shimmer Mark, they navigate treacherous planets, engage in intense combat, and uncover the mysteries that unfold across the cosmos.\r\nThe gameplay loop is simple; it's not a roguelite anymore but more of a shooter with steady level progression. Enter a level, kill monsters, loot gold, buy upgrades, and extract. Rinse and repeat for the next level. It still has that roguelite touch, though, as upgrades and looted gold are only temporary for that run, so you're encouraged to spend everything you can during runs.\r\nWhile the game is also marketed as having four-player co-op, a substantial part of the experience is actually in single-player mode, and multiplayer is unlocked deep further into the game. In Singleplayer, there are multiple planets to conquer, with five levels each divided into small areas. All playable in three difficulty settings. The progression system ties seamlessly into the rescue mission narrative, reinforcing the player's connection to the overarching story even if it’s just a minor narrative element.\r\nRisk of Rain: Hostile Worlds adopts the typical mobile game model with free-to-play, microtransactions, hero collecting, and gacha elements. While this aligns with prevalent trends in mobile gaming, it introduces a departure from the traditional Risk of Rain formula that not everyone will like. Some might prefer it to be a premium game with an upfront cost. Having said that, I was satisfied with my solo free-to-play experience so far, I got everything I need to progress through the first few hours of play in this CBT.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6558920) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It's a looter shooter with Action RPG elements, which can be quite addicting. However, I have always struggled to reconcile the concept of its realistic, grounded setting with its RPG mechanics. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but seeing a Diablo-like game in a shooter's skin felt odd to me. Ordinary individuals with guns in our real world, yet they need to find legendary firearms to defeat bullet sponge enemies that are also supposed to be humans. Despite this, The Division's system works exceptionally well once you immerse yourself in gameplay.\r\nNow, on mobile, we finally have our own version with The Division Resurgence, offering a fully-fledged third-person shooter experience on the go. The original two games were simply too extensive to be ported 1:1, so Ubisoft decided to create its own mobile adaptation. The good news is that it's available for a variety of mobile phones, not restricted to just the latest iPhones. The game is still not out yet, with plans to release next year, but I was able to get access to the Closed Beta that has started recently and will last until December.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe Division Resurgence is set between the first and second mainline games and is essentially The Division 1.5. Resurgence plunges players back into modern New York City ravaged by a deadly virus and put on lockdown. The narrative revolves around the literal resurgence of chaos and threats that was originally resolved in the first game. This approach introduces a sense of continuity for series veterans while providing a fresh and welcoming angle for newcomers. Familiar faces make a return, adding depth to the lore and tying the mobile game seamlessly into the broader Division universe.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe graphics maintain the signature style of the original titles, showcasing highly detailed models, immersive environments, and realistic lighting. For the most part, it feels and looks like a PS4 game ported to consoles. However, the mobile adaptation naturally comes with concessions. I was able to play the game on medium settings at medium frame rates (45 FPS) and my Snapdragon 888 phone held up pretty well. The game looks impressive as a mobile phone, although I do hope it can be optimized a bit more, since there’s still plenty of time before release.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe Division Resurgence maintains the core gameplay loop that fans of the series have come to love. As a third-person cover shooter, the game emphasizes strategic positioning, quick thinking, and teamwork. The mobile adaptation successfully captures the intensity and tactical depth of its console counterparts, offering a compelling experience on a smaller screen.\r\nThe cover system remains a cornerstone of the gameplay. Players can seamlessly move from cover to cover, utilizing the environment strategically to avoid enemy fire and plan their next move. The touch controls effectively translate this mechanic to mobile, allowing for intuitive cover-based engagements.\r\nIn addition to the structured story missions, Resurgence retains an open-world format. Players can explore the ravaged streets of New York City, encountering dynamic events, side missions, and hostile factions.  These can be done in either solo or in up to four players in matchmaking.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe shooting mechanics in Resurgence aim to replicate the satisfying gunplay of its predecessors. The touch controls provide a surprising level of precision, allowing players to aim, shoot, and switch between weapons seamlessly. The inclusion of a variety of firearms, each with its own feel and characteristics, adds depth to the combat experience.\r\nI opted to make 99% of my experience utilize the touchscreen controls, and good news is that, they work pretty well. If you’re used to mobile shooters like PUBG or CODM, you’ll feel right at home with this one. Although it does include more than your usual number of abilities and moves to use, two weapons, three abilities, a cover button, a jump button, and a roll button.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nWhile touchscreen controls are serviceable, the game truly shines when played with a physical controller, which is fully supported with its own UI and button prompts shown on-screen. The difference is night and day for me, and it really felt like I was playing a console game. The implementation is really good, the sensitivity is just right, there is aim assist, and the bindings are all industry standard.\r\nIt even supported my Dualshock 4 controller properly with correct button layouts. UI and menu navigation is also supported for controllers, but it mostly gives you the glorified analog cursor navigation that we hate so much in console games. Still, its pretty serviceable and somewhat playable without ever touching the screen. The addition of industry-standard controller support, including compatibility with Dualshock 4 and keyboard/mouse, transforms the mobile experience into something akin to playing on a console.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe Division series is renowned for its loot-centric progression, and Resurgence continues this tradition. Players can collect gear sets to unlock bonuses, encouraging exploration and engagement in various activities. The loop of finding, upgrading, and customizing gear remains addictive, ensuring a constant sense of progression.\r\nThe game features character specializations, each offering a unique set of skills and abilities. The choice of specialization contributes to defining the player's role in a team and adds an additional layer of strategy to both PvE and PvP encounters.\r\nThe Division hub serves as the central location for players to buy and sell gear, upgrade equipment, and manage their inventory. This hub maintains the franchise's identity, providing a familiar space for players to interact with vendors, customize loadouts, and optimize their gear.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe shift to a free-to-play model comes as no surprise in the mobile gaming landscape. While the beta test isn’t an accurate representation of the final product, I could already see the foundations of monetization being built. Mainly with the cosmetics and its potential pay-to-win model with its option to purchase Premium credits, which then can be used to purchase bundles that can speed up progression.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe immersive world, engaging storyline, and addictive RPG mechanics of The Division successfully make the leap to mobile with The Division Resurgence. It’s basically The Division 1.5 made on the go. Honestly, aside from general optimization and bug squashing, the only thing left to do is implement a fair balance between in-app purchases and a rewarding progression system that will be pivotal for a balanced financial success / player satisfaction ratio.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6561122) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This fully-fledged third-person shooter attempts to capture the essence of its console predecessors while catering to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by mobile gaming. As a player with an extensive history in the franchise, diving into the mobile adaptation raised questions about how well the gritty realism and addictive gameplay loop of The Division could be translated to the smaller screen.\r\nTrue to its roots, Resurgence is a third-person cover shooter, emphasizing tactical combat in a post-pandemic urban landscape. The transition to mobile introduces touchscreen controls that surprisingly work well. The game's controls include the usual array for a mobile shooter but expand to accommodate the complexity of The Division's RPG elements, including two weapons, three abilities, cover, jump, and roll buttons.\r\nCombat in Resurgence successfully captures the smooth and satisfying feel of its console predecessors. Whether it's dropping enemies with headshots or strategically taking down foes, the shooting mechanics remain precise and responsive. The decision to include a variety of abilities adds depth to combat, though the touchscreen controls may present a learning curve. The support for physical controllers and even full keyboard and mouse, however, transforms the experience, making it feel akin to playing on a console or even PC.\r\nResurgence retains the familiar progression system of the main games. Collecting gear sets for bonuses and upgrading equipment continue to be the driving force behind character development. The game, at least the CBT, features four Specialities, offering players different playstyles. The inclusion of a full campaign and open-world gameplay enhances the mobile experience, keeping the loop of missions, loot, and upgrades intact.\r\nIt really is a fully fledged The Division experience on mobile, with console-like graphics and presentation. The best part is, it's available for a variety of mobile phones, not restricted to just the latest iPhones. The game is still not out yet, with plans to release next year.

    "body": "The Walking Dead: Destinies\r\n8.7\r\nAction\r\nAction role-playing\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nThe Walking Dead is one of those franchises that’s probably in a weird limbo between popularity and obscurity. People probably stopped watching it or reading the comics years ago, and yet, it somehow keeps on low-key pumping video games of mixed quality left and right, and people still keep on buying it.\r\nFrom the massive failure of Overkill's The Walking Dead to the cult success of the Telltale series and the impressive VR game series Saints and Sinners. Now we have another game that is probably a few years too late visually and narratively, and no the title is not a typo — It’s really a contender for the worst game of the year award if there ever was one.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Brings alternate story paths for AMC’s established TV series storyline## Cons\r\n-Dated and ugly visuals\r\n-Poor presentation; the cutscenes aren’t even animated\r\n-Clunky gameplay\r\n-Major bugs\r\n-Only covers up to Season 4\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe Walking Dead: Destinies invites players to embark on an alternative retelling of AMC's iconic television series. Players will take control of various characters from the AMC series, whether friend or foe, ranging from Rick to the Governor. Their choices will shape the destiny of a team of characters from The Walking Dead universe, altering the course of the story and revealing the diverse outcomes that certain choices can bring—outcomes that fans may have always imagined.\r\nHowever, the story it covers is relatively short, not to mention the pacing is quick and skips/shortens/omits various events and characters. All in all, it encompasses only up to Season 4. These story arcs may have been forgotten by most and remembered only by the most avid fans like me. So no Terminus, no Wolves, no Negan, and many more. The concept of seeing alternative stories coming out of alternative choices is indeed interesting, but I feel that the game at its current narrative coverage came too late.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Presentation\r\nGraphically, the game stands out for all the wrong reasons. This is the most noticeable aspect right out of the bat; the game just outright looks bad, and maybe the worse game I’ve seen visually in recent times. Even for last gen standards, this is way below it. It looks worse than a PS3 game, and we’re not even talking about the animations and voice acting yet.\r\nThe characters look like deformed representations of the AMC characters, and all the story cutscenes are just moving stills with voice overs. I played it on the Nintendo Switch, which made the experience even a lot worse than playing on modern consoles with its low resolution and 30FPS performance, but regardless, it looks bad across all platforms.\r\nThe animations are low quality and everything from the running, dodging, to attacks and interactions looks very goofy and clunky. The voice acting is bad overall, some voice actors are returning, but the majority are not, so there is a bit of impersonation work with the characters voices; some more effective than others, but most are just badly done.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe Walking Dead: Destinies is basically a third-person action game, the players are placed in iconic locations like Atlanta, the Greene family farm, the prison, and Woodbury, reliving key moments from The Walking Dead. The narrative unfolds through crucial choice-driven moments, allowing players to alter the course of AMC's The Walking Dead history.\r\nThe game will occassionally present the players with two choices, which will save one character and doom another. For example, one of the most iconic moments of the TV series is the incident between Rick and Shane, and here you’ll get to pick which character lives or dies. If you have watched the TV series and still remember the story, you probably will have an insight on the outcome of some of the choices being presented.\r\nMe personally, I’d like to see things play differently, so I opted to chose the alternative routes. This aspect basically the only interesting aspect of this game, and they could have just doubled down on this concept choices matter instead, creating a game akin to Telltale’s approach. The game features five acts, each comprising around five levels with varying objectives. Objectives include eliminating walkers, moving from point A to point B, finding items, or interacting with characters.\r\nMechanically, the game features basic and heavy melee attacks, as well as the option to take things stealthy with one-hit take downs. Each character will have their own unique melee and ranged weapon equipped (For example, Michonne’s Katana or Rick’s Revolver).\r\nIn addition, the characters also have a unique skill tree with effects that are shared within a specific character group. For example, unlocking skills for Shane will also make it available for others to use. However, if Shane dies, you’ll lose this unlocked skill, further emphasizing the importance of choices. On paper, it’s a cool concept just like the narrative premise, but implemented here, it’s just a clunky and buggy piece of work. The game overall is buggy, with various game breaking bugs existing as of writing. My worst experience was encountering a white screen upon reloading a checkpoint, with no way to fix it unless I restart multiple times.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe game's attempt at offering a fresh perspective on the iconic TV series is hindered by dated visuals, buggy gameplay, and poor presentation. The game's belated arrival seems to missed the peak of the series' popularity by a few years and is a missed opportunity on all fronts; timing, polish, and execution. The only saving grace is the alternate stories that can come out of alternate decisions you can make in the game, but even with these elements, it isn’t enough to push the game from more than 1 out of 10. A true contender, for worst game of the year.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6571261) Originally posted on TapTap.",

This is essentially a perfect 1:1 port of what is probably the best and most deep autobattler out there. With LoL and TFT already on mobile, another highly anticipated game from Riot: Valorant, is also making its way to mobile.\r\n## Pros\r\n- An excellent port of the PC version\r\n- Strategic autobattler depth and gameplay\r\n- Optimized for mobile\r\n- No noticeable compromises in visuals and performance\r\n- Crossplay and cross-progression capabilities## Cons\r\n-Might be harder to play with smaller screen sized phones\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nIn Teamfight Tactics (TFT), players strategically assemble teams of champions, each with unique abilities and synergies, on a hexagonal board. The game consists of recruitment phases where champions are purchased, preparation phases for positioning and itemization, and auto-battle phases where teams engage in combat automatically depending on unit composition and placement. It's basically a round-based PvP auto-chess game with unique twists and engaging mechanics.\r\nPlayers must build synergistic teams to maximize bonuses and counter opponents. The gold economy plays a crucial role, allowing players to reroll champions, level up, or buy experience points to gain more unit slots. The item system lets champions equip and upgrade items for enhanced power. Carousel rounds add strategic choices, and health points decrease with each round loss.  The thrill of watching your carefully crafted team clash with opponents is always an exciting feeling that engages players inner competitiveness without much reliance on fast reflexes or split-second decision making, unlike games like League of Leagues or Valorant.\r\nThe game features ranked modes, regular updates, and a dynamic meta, making TFT a compelling and strategic auto-battler experience where adaptability and decision-making are paramount.\r\n## 🌐Crossplay Capabilities\r\nFans of TFT on PC, as well as mobile gamers across APAC, will now be able to play TFT on their Android and Apple devices with full crossplay and cross-progression support with PC. However, it's not designed for seamless switching, so you'll probably need to hold off on your hopes of starting a match on PC and then continuing it on your phone in your living room as you go out.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nTFT Mobile maintains the visually pleasing aesthetic of the League of Legends universe, with vibrant and detailed champion designs. The transition to mobile devices doesn't compromise the visual quality; the graphics are crisp, and the art style remains consistent with the PC version. The intuitive user interface ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience, even on smaller screens.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nTFT Mobile adopts a free-to-play model with in-app purchases. The monetization strategy primarily focuses on cosmetic items, such as new champion skins and Little Legends, which have no impact on gameplay. This is probably my most favorite form of monetization, one that balances player satisfaction and financial success. Still free-to-play, but no pay-to-win mechanisms.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nTFT Mobile is a great port, and players won't face significant disadvantages compared to their PC counterparts, especially on tablets. The only potential concern is the screen size, which will vary among users.  I tested the game on an iPhone 13 Mini and I did not experience any performance issues. Even with such a tiny screen, the game remains playable, although I would recommend playing it on a bigger screen, since there is no way to increase the UI scale if you find it too small. Battery drain and heat aren’t issues in my experience, in fact, it’s just like browsing Facebook or watching YouTube.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe quality of TFT Mobile both as a port and as an autobattler game deserves commendation. Riot Games has masterfully translated the intricate and strategic gameplay of the PC version into a mobile format without compromising its essence. Now, players in Asia can enjoy the same level of depth and excitement on their Android and Apple devices, making TFT Mobile a stellar example of a successful mobile port.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6570637) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Persona 5 Tactica\r\n9.6\r\nAnime\r\nTactical\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nFrom its indie spin-off roots to its present status that I would describe as the current flagship JRPG game series, Persona has undeniably come a long way. Now, it is venturing into even more genres with successful experiments, beginning with games like Persona 5 Strikers featuring real-time combat and, most recently, Persona 5 Tactica, adopting a Final Tactics-style grid-based combat system.\r\n## Pros\r\n- The best turn-based combat mechanics for Persona ever made\r\n- Highly strategic combat\r\n- Fast paced missions and full of action\r\n- Sleek user interface and presentation\r\n- Simple, neat, and refreshing visuals## Cons\r\n-No slice of life elements\r\n-Assumes you played Pesrona 5 and knows its characters, not standalone or newcomer friendly\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nTactica's narrative is set within the events of Persona 5 itself, placing players in the shoes of the Phantom Thieves as they embark on an unexpected journey, the story takes a detour from the main Persona 5 storyline, presenting itself as a somewhat of a big side quest before Persona 5 ends.\r\nA mysterious occurrence suddenly transports the Phantom Thieves to the Kingdoms, an unfamiliar world with a European cityscape that looks very French-Revolution-era inspired. The introduction of Legionnaires and the rebel figure \"Erina\" kickstarts a revolution, thrusting players into a plot that explores uncharted territory.\r\nUnfortunately, the game isn’t really standalone narrative wise and not newcomer friendly. It assumes you’ve already played the mainline game Persona 5 and know the characters, and just jumps straight right into the middle of its story. So, I wouldn’t recommend to play this if you haven’t played at least a good chunk of Persona 5.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe graphics retain the cel-shaded anime style reminiscent of Persona 5, but there is a huge difference in the art style across the board. The characters now sport a Chibi art style, appearing more cartoonish and childish.\r\nFor those familiar with the series, this art style resembles that used in the Persona Q games. The Chibi style is also reflected in character artwork during dialogues and cutscenes. For someone transitioning from the mainline Persona 5 game, familiar faces will now be seen transformed into Chibi form. Personally, I am not a fan of this change, but looking at it objectively, it offers a simple, neat, and refreshing visual approach.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nPersona 5 Tactica is a tactical role-playing game, as mentioned before — it’s much like Final Fantasy Tactica, with hints of similarities to XCOM when it comes to ranged attacks and using cover. The game presents a top-down grid layout for battles, emphasizing strategic positioning and environmental considerationsike taking cover. Still, It utilizes some familiar mechanics of the Persona series, such as Persona abilities and One Mores during downs or critical hits.\r\nThis is all done without any point and click mechanics. Instead, during turns, players can freely move their units within their movement range (and switch between all three characters), and perform actions such as melee or ranged attacks. They then can finalize their turn once they’re satisfied.\r\nUp to three party members engage in combat, and this time, the protagonist is not always needed in the party. Three combatants can create a triangular area to target enemies, which is called a All-Out Attack — which is another franchise staple.\r\nThis game is much more focused now on the combat and narrative side. The slice-of-life elements are gone and taking a break for now; no more attending classes, befriending people, and just messing around the city during the day. The mainline games takes care of that. This is one of my favorite aspects of the series, so its unfortunate not to have it this time, but as this is just a spin-off game, its kinda okay.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nPersona 5 Tactica's combat system distinguishes itself with a blend of turn-based strategy and environmental manipulation. The grid-based layout and the incorporation of One More mechanic from Persona 5 introduce a unique and satisfying twist to battles. Displacing enemies from cover, leveraging persona abilities to inflict status effects, and orchestrating chain and triple threat attacks form the core of the combat strategy.\r\nCombat remains consistently engaging, with the introduction of new mechanics, enemy types, and powers throughout the game. It’s not always defeat all enemies to progress, sometimes you just have to survive, or escape, or perhaps complete some of the missions challenges, like complete the mission under a specific amount of turns. The continuous evolution of mission mechanics ensures that players are kept on their toes, making each encounter feel fresh.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nPersona 5 Tactica excels in providing a satisfying progression system, once again, The Velvet Room — another series staple — is back, offering players a robust set of customization options. Each character can equip two personas simultaneously and the familiar fusion system of personas introduces uniquely powerful firearms, expanding the arsenal of tools available for players to experiment with.\r\nPersona games are always very long games, and this isn’t an exemption. Expect around 40 hours for the main story alone. Personally, I haven’t fully completed it yet, as I do like to take my time in these kinds of game. But so far, after literally going in blind, I was pleasantly surprised with my experience. (Just to share, A friend who’s a big fan of Persona always kept sending me gameplay videos leading to the release, especially that he has played it in a booth a few weeks ago. I basically semi-ignored these footages and didn’t pay much attention to it.)\r\n## 📜Is this the future of Persona?\r\nHonestly, the gameplay here is probably my preferred option for general turn-based combat goodness, as it introduces unit positions and the environment to the equation. It’s actually already feeling close to Baldur’s Gate 3’s combat, and I feel that if both Atlus and its fans are open enough to the idea, it’s probably the next logical step in Persona’s evolution. It could really be a potential system to use for Persona 6. It’s still turn-based, but you get more layers of strategy to it without feeling being overcomplicated.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nPersona 5 Tactica performed beautifully on my Xbox Series S and PC, even supporting my 144 refresh rate. The game features a sleek user interface, beautiful cutscenes, and exceptional voice acting, all wonderfully done. The games animations are buttery smooth. And the game is overall very well polished upon release.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe story is not as standalone as I would like it to be, and there’s no slice-of-life elements in it. Still, with 2023 already packed as it is, Persona 5 Tactica not only holds its ground but stands out as both literally and figuratively a revolutionary spin-off that successfully merges tactical gameplay with Persona’s magic. If you still have time for another game in this jam-packed year and is already a fan of at least Persona 5 to begin with, then this is an absolute must play. You might be very well be seeing the future of Persona here.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6573235) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game falls short due to dated visuals, buggy gameplay, and lackluster presentation.\r\nThe graphics are notably subpar, resembling a PS3 game, and the storytelling relies on moving stills with voiceovers, contributing to an overall lack of quality presentation. The gameplay, structured as a third-person action experience, suffers from clunky mechanics and various game-breaking bugs, with some issues requiring multiple restarts to address. Despite the promise of altering the narrative through choices, the game struggles to fully capitalize on this unique aspect.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6571234) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Set during the events of Persona 5, the Phantom Thieves find themselves in the 'Kingdoms', facing an armed group called Legionnaires.\r\nThe game introduces a grid-based combat system with Chibi-style characters, departing from the traditional turn-based battles and anime-inspired art style.

With a focus on crossplay and cross-progression, TFT Mobile allows gamers across various platforms to compete whether you're on PC or mobile.\r\nReleased back in 2020 for iOS and Android, just one year after it's original PC release as side-game for League of Legends and subsequent rise in popularity, TFTs successful transition to mobile devices has been well-received, offering a 1:1 port that maintains the strategic depth and excitement of the PC version. TFT Mobile optimizes features for smaller screens while preserving the vibrancy and visual appeal of the League of Legends universe.\r\nIn TFT, players strategically assemble teams of champions, each with unique abilities and synergies, on a hexagonal board. The game consists of recruitment phases where champions are purchased, preparation phases for positioning and itemization, and auto-battle phases where teams engage in combat automatically depending on unit composition and placement. It's basically autochess with its own League of Legends twists and unique engaging mechanics.\r\nOverall, TFT stands as arguably the premier competitive autochess / autobattler game available, presenting itself as a noteworthy addition to the thriving ultra competitive gaming landscape in Asia.

    "body": "Jujutsu Kaisen: Phantom Parade is finally out now, after a myriad of delays from 2022 to the tail end of 2023, with a limited release yesterday November 21, 2023.\r\nHowever, the game is only available for the Japan region, and not all VPN services work properly with the servers. What worked for me though is OvpnSpider on Android so you can also try that out (it's free).\r\n1. Download on TapTap\r\n2 Connect via VPN (I used OvpnSpider, not all VPN services will work)\r\n3. Open the game app\r\n4. Let it download the rest of the files (you can disconnect the VPN if it's too slow, it will still continue to download even if the VPN is now disconnected)\r\n5. Play the game (reconnect to VPN again if you previously disconnected to download)\r\nThat's it, you can finally try the game. Warning though, the game is strictly in Japanese only, so you'll probably not enjoy it as much if it had proper localization.\r\nMoving forward, Jujutsu Kaisen: Phantom Parade is basically a turn-based RPG gacha games like Fate Grand Order and Naruto Ninja Tribes. Kind of like old school or classic style of visuals/combat, but one that feels refreshing in this day and age full of cel-shaded real-time action RPGs.\r\nThe gameplay revolves around assembling a team of characters from the Jujutsu Kaisen universe, each with unique abilities and attributes. The progression mainly involves advancing through the story, farming for upgrades, and acquiring new characters through gacha pulls.\r\nHonestly, there isn't much to do here yet other than continuing to progress through the story and farming for upgrades to pull new characters. So, your enjoyment really depends on how much you love Jujutsu Kaisen and if you are open to experiencing the story again (plus other new story content) in a different medium. My recommendation? Just hope and wait for a global release. You can try it for now, but I doubt you'll find any longevity in it with the constant need for specific VPNs and lack of english localization.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6579413) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Jujutsu Kaisen Phantom ParadeJP\r\n9.0\r\nRPG\r\nStrategy\r\nPC Version\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nJujutsu Kaisen: Phantom Parade, another highly anticipated mobile game anime adaptation, is finally out now, but only in Japan for the time being. Developed by Sumzap, Phantom Parade brings players back to the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, offering a turn-based RPG experience, a retelling of its story, as well as new content.\r\nThe game made its debut on November 21, 2023. However, there is no official confirmation regarding its release in regions beyond Japan. The launch coincided with a significant pre-registration milestone of 1.5 million, which rewards all players with an SSR-Guaranteed Gacha Ticket.\r\n## 📖Story and Presentation\r\nPhantom Parade embarks on the well-trodden path of retelling the TV anime's narrative while injecting freshness through new Japanese voice overs with original voice actors reprising their roles, plus new original storylines. It introduces a few original characters too,  treating both seasoned fans and newcomers.\r\nThe cutscenes are recreated stills of anime scenes or presented in a visual novel style dialogue format. To be honest, it’s not that compelling and you’ll probably not get invested in the story especially if you are a newcomer to the series.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nFor me, the art style is a refreshing (or classic) take on Anime-video game adaptations. Instead of using the now popular cel-shaded graphics to effectively translate the 2D anime into 3D form, the characters and elements in the game are designed with a flat, two-dimensional appearance, resembling paper cutouts that are animated on a side-scrolling background. It looks like Fate Grand Order or perhaps Darkest Dungeon sometimes in terms of how the characters move.\r\nBecause of this 2D design direction, the visuals actually look much closer to their anime counterparts than let’s say going with a cel-shaded design. The animations are still fluid, and they really bring the characters to life.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nPhantom Parade follows the footsteps of popular turn-based RPG gacha games like Fate Grand Order and Naruto Ninja Tribes. The gameplay revolves around assembling a team of characters from the Jujutsu Kaisen universe, each with unique abilities and attributes. The progression mainly involves advancing through the story, farming for upgrades, and acquiring new characters through gacha pulls.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe battles are all in side-view, with your team and the enemies positioned alongside each other, taking turns to attack. Each character variant has its own unique ability sets— one basic attack, two abilities that cost mana to activate, and an ultimate ability (with a matching flavorful animation)—charged by the continuous use of attacks. Up to two characters’ simultaneous ultimate abilities can be chained together, resulting in a combo attack.\r\nA weakness system is in place, imposing penalties or resistances depending on the type of unit and attack used. Additionally, enemies feature a defense break system that inflicts massive damage bonuses once broken. As build a team by collecting and selecting various characters from the Jujutsu Kaisen universe, different variants of characters that has their own upgradable power levels, distinct abilities, and attributes that affect the team's overall performance.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nHonestly, there isn't much to do here other than continuing to progress through the story and farming for upgrades to pull new characters. So, your enjoyment really depends on how much you love Jujutsu Kaisen and if you are open to experiencing the story again (plus excited for the new original story content) in a different medium.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nAs is typical in the free-to-play mobile game model, Phantom Parade incorporates in-app gacha purchases. Players can expedite their progress or acquire premium gacha pulls by spending real money. The game features different banners, and the initial experience has been generous for me, I already got 2 SSR characters within the first hour of play, including one from a free SSR ticket.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nIn terms of technical performance, Phantom Parade delivers a visually appealing and smoothly animated experience. No crashes, no performance issues, and it's not really resource intensive for my Snapdragon 888 device, no heating or battery usage issues. However, the current limitation of being available only in Japan and with Japanese language support poses a huge barrier for international players.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI feel like Jujutsu Kaisen Phantom Parade is doing just a tad bit above the bare minimum for a game, which is very unfortunate. As a turn-based RPG gacha game, everything it has, I have already seen before. As mentioned earlier, only try this if you want new story content, a retelling of the anime in video game format, and/or if you just plain love Jujutsu Kaisen and would consume any form of Jujutsu Kaisen content coming your way. Even then, the game is only playable in Japan and is only available in Japanese. I would highly recommend waiting for this game to mature some more and maybe get a global / english release before trying it out, if it will even come to that point.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6579428) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nLethal Company is a first-person survival co-op game with a unique combination of survival, cooperation, and resource management, focusing on meeting quotas as objectives and navigating through eerie environments. The game was released in Early Access on October 24, 2023, and is rapidly gaining popularity recently. The game is designed around a maximum four-player co-op experience, but it is also playable solo or with more than four people with the use of mods.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nAs a contracted worker for a mysterious space-faring company, players are tasked with scavenging random scrap from abandoned, industrialized moons. Aside from the premise, there isn’t really not much of story here, although there are bits of lore the developers have already implemented for players to piece together and form theories on.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Presentation\r\nLethal Company has a look similar to PC games from the 90s, blending old-school graphics with modern first-person movement. The game has a creepy and mechanical feel, using 90s-style graphics with low-detail models, basic text, and a somewhat irradiated filter effect. The use of retro colors and metallic tones creates a scary atmosphere, especially in the run-down and dark hallways and rooms. Playing the game gives you a strong sense of fear and tension, especially when separated from your comrades.\r\nThe animations and physics are wonky and funny looking, and I’m not sure if that is part of its intended charm or something that will get realistic over time. For now, it at least balances the tension with its own brand of chaotic and goofy fun.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay Overview\r\nLethal Company's gameplay is a carefully orchestrated dance of survival, cooperation, and calculated risk-taking. The core objective of the game is to meet profit quotas within a limited timeframe by collecting random scrap from moons. Players can land on a chosen moon once a day, and after the third day, you must meet the required item value quota or suffer disciplinary action.\r\nThe gameplay is not solely about individual survival; it emphasizes collaboration as players can choose to guide their crew from the safety of the ship or venture into dangerous environments together. This cooperative element adds depth and a layer of intensity to the overall experience. This is similar to the format seen in the game Phasmophobia, where one player can stay in the spawn to provide intel while the rest of the team go out on the field.\r\n## ♟️♟️Is it strictly cooperative or is Singleplayer possible?\r\nThis game is clearly intended for a cooperative experience because playing in singleplayer or even as a duo, while possible, places you at a significant disadvantage. The objectives, loot, and the speed of time don't adjust accordingly. A single player can only carry so many things at once, specifically up to four small items and just one big item. As a result, you must make more trips back and forth to your ship, and looting is significantly slower.\r\nThe cooperative element enables players to work together to be able to efficiently scour the procedurally generated levels for scrap, and not die trying. As players meet quotas, they earn credits to spend money on gizmos. The Company store introduces an array of tools, from lights to stun grenades, enhancing the strategic dimension. Players can also buy a walkie-talkie to communicate over long distances and even teleporters to extract with ease.\r\n## 📞Immersive proximity voice chat: “Just follow my voice”\r\nWhy buy a walkie-talkie when you have Discord, though? It’s because one standout feature is the dynamic proximity voice chat with really good positional audio implementation, with matching sound modulation depending on your location; perhaps a long hallway, a cramped room, or an open landscape. It fosters real-time communication that adds a layer of realism and excitement to cooperative play.\r\nVoice is an integral part of the game and can even help you navigate the labyrinthine buildings. Just follow your teammate's voice, and you're going to be fine... probably. A friend following you from behind, and suddenly his voice cuts out, is both a hilarious and terrifying experience. With this, the use of third-party voice chat applications like Discord or Teamspeak are highly discouraged.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat is not the primary focus, and hide-and-seek encounters with alien monsters add a thrilling twist to the gameplay. Each creature presents unique challenges, requiring players to tread carefully on these abandoned moons. Audio cues and detection methods distinguish these encounters, creating a dynamic experience where players must approach each situation thoughtfully. The game still offers an option to dispatch some of these creatures, but it’s still a very risky maneuver.\r\n## 🏗 Progression and Level Design\r\nThere are three tiers of moons you can visit, each based on difficulty and reward, providing players with a clear path for advancement. The final tier requires in-game credits for access but potentially offers more risks and rewards. As players face more challenging monster combinations in later stages, intense cooperation becomes crucial. As you survive for more days, the quota increases.\r\nThe game uses procedural generation for the interior of the buildings which will comprise 90% of your gameplay, the procedural generation system is already serviceable for the gameplay, but it still needs a lot of work in terms of being believable and logical. There’s lots of dead ends present with senseless empty hallways or catwalks leading to nothing. It takes away some of the immersion, so I hope this is a priority for the developers.\r\n## ☠️Is it really scary?\r\nTrue, it’s a horror game, but it’s more of a mix of monster and survival horror tropes. It’s not really scary compared to let’s say Silent Hill, or Alan Wake, and it’s probably due to the fact that the game is designed to be played cooperatively up to four players and more with the help of mods. The experience is much closer to something that lands in the middle of Left 4 Dead and Phasmophobia; Not as action packed as Left 4 Dead, but not as terrifying as Phasmophobia. Here, you’re encountering real tangible threats in the form of alien monsters, and you have friends alongside you doing some stupidly fun stuff.\r\nHaving said that, the game is still scary and creepy. They absolutely nailed the atmosphere, I love the way tension is built and how fear is instilled for the players. It’s all organic both literally and figuratively. There are still jumpscare moments which I usually hate, but not in this game; here it’s much more natural and procedural; no cheap scripted cliche ones to startle the player.\r\n## 📊At the end of the day, It’s still in Early Access\r\nHaving been impressed a lot by its concept and execution, it’s important to note that this game is still in Early Access, more specifically, only released a month ago as of this writing. There’s a lot of room for improvement here, from the performance, which was less than I expected for my system, to more gameplay mechanics, optimized level design, and general polish. There’s tons of fun to be had already, especially with a max party or even more with mods, but don’t expect it to last for hours on end like well established long running coop games with years worth of content.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWith its unique blend of 90s-style graphics and modern gameplay dynamics, Lethal Company stands as a promising breath of fresh (or irradiated?) air in the survival and cooperative genres. The core elements of scavenging together through eerie dilapidated buildings, using proximity voice chat as an integral part of the experience, and properly managing resources to meet quotas create an immersive gameplay loop that is already well worth its current price for the fun it offers, and it will only get better as more updates come, hopefully.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6584569) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Players find themselves at the epicenter of this turmoil, thrust into a world where the once-stable forces of order have been disrupted. The quest unfolds as characters explore dungeons, face intense battles, and strive to restore balance by uncovering the mysteries behind the sabotage. Honestly, I did not find the story that compelling; it’s very simple and for me it only serves to set the stage for the ARPG goodness that the game is focusing on.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nStaying true to the charm of its predecessor, Soul Knight Prequel presents a delightful blend of 2D pixel art and pixelated 3D enviroments. The visuals maintain the colorful and vibrant aesthetic established by Soul Knight, yet they evolve with more resolution and enhanced lighting. The result is a visually pleasing world that captures the essence of the original while offering a fresh and updated experience. The soundtrack though is a bit lacking; It's charmingly decent and lighthearted, but it could use more variety especially during combat, because it still plays those lighthearted soundtrack during intense action-packed moments.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay of Soul Knight Prequel is characterized by its ARPG nature. As players and created characters delve into dungeons in an ARPG style reminiscent of Diablo, the emphasis is on real-time action, colorful visuals, and strategic combat. The game retains the essence of its predecessor, offering an extensive loop of dungeon crawling, loot acquisition, and character improvement. There’s two gameplay modes to start the game; The self-explanatory Story mode, and Adventure which cuts all the narrative and jumps straight into the ARPG goodness.\r\nThe home village that you’ll encounter early on in the story will serve as a hub for various activities and interactions with NPCs; Merchants, traders, and smiths provide avenues for resource management and gear improvement, as well as the option to see and switch to your other characters, as well as see other players too. You also get your own space that you can customize the interior with furnitures and preferred colorways.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat system in Soul Knight Prequel retains the intensity and excitement of the original, with fast-paced battles and an array of powerful and visually spectacular skills. Players can select from seven different initial characters, each possessing unique classes that go beyond your typical archetypes. Here we have Warrior, Archer, Tempest Mage, Animancer, Aegis, Thief, and Pyromancer. In addition, you also unlock a secondary class further on, and even hybrid class even much further, adding diversity and depth to the combat and progression system, allowing for varied strategies and playstyles.\r\nHowever, the over-the-top and tantalizing visuals towards the tail end of the game’s progression might become a double-edged sword, as in moments of intense action or when the screen is filled with various effects, it tends to block what’s happening and obscure what’s actually happening to the characters, especially that the visual fidelity is limited by its 2D pixel art style.\r\nThe multiplayer aspect enhances the experience, with both local LAN co-op and plans for remote online co-op, promising engaging battles and collaborative gameplay.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nSoul Knight Prequel emphasizes character progression and personalization. The traditional ARPG elements of leveling up, alotting attributes and skill points, farming for loot, finding gear and equipping your characters six slots of equipment: Necklaces, Rings, Boots, Helmets, Armors, and Weapons — with no class restrictions. At level five, there is a secondary class, while level 8 unlocks powerful hybrid/combo classes. Upgrading gear are enhanced with a unique set item system called Fatebounds, that exists as magical properties of rare items, in which proper synergy and combination can result into massive bonuses. This is essentially a refreshing take on the “Set Items System” we always see in these ARPG games. This system introduces synergies and combinations, offering players the opportunity to strategize and optimize their characters for maximum efficiency.\r\nCustomization extends to skills, allowing players to tailor their skill hotbar to their preferred playstyle. There are also cute little pets to follow you around, which can be collected, trained, and adopted, that adds a charming and loyal companion to accompany players on their adventures. As mentioned earlier, players can also customize, decorate, and design their home, including arranging the furnitures around, a small but neat detail that adds some degree of customization and personalization to the player.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nSoul Knight Prequel is a free to play game but includes in-game purchases. It has some minor gacha elements, implemented through the purchase of chests containing potentially powerful gear. While the majority of items can be obtained through exploration, the in-game purchases adds an extra layer of progression for those looking to accelerate their character's development with real money all while supporting the makers of the game.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nPerformance wise, the game performed smoothly on my Snapdragon 888 device. A fluid 60fps while inside the town and some big acceptable drops when the visual clutter is dialed down to 11.  I would love it if the performance stability can reach a flat 60 fps though, since the game only sports a pixel art style. I haven’t encountered any game breaking bugs.\r\nA bit unfortunate , is that the game is online-only, which is a bummer especially since it’s a mobile APRG. Players will always be at the mercy of their internet connection and the server’s stability. For example, I’ve had minor connectivity issues during my testing.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nSoul Knight Prequel builds upon the charm of its predecessor but steers the franchise in a new but adjacent direction by offering an engaging ARPG experience with deep mechanics, good itemization, and open ended gameplay loop. Despite drawbacks such as its weak story and online only requirements, Soul Knight Prequel earns a commendable recommendation for me for both fans of the original roguelite game and newcomers seeking an exciting Action RPG adventure.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6586307) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Although even in single player, the game still requires you to connect to their servers, making the game is effectively online-only. Unfortunately, this alone is a dealbreaker for some people. Nevertheless, the game alone is a decent pixel ARPG game that's probably worth an install on your mobile phone if you love these kinds of games, especially since it's free-to-play.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6586308) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Set in a breathtaking fantasy world with a focus on the skies and seas, Revelation M casts players as new adventurers embarking on a journey of exploration, discovery, and adventure.\r\nTo start off, Revelation M boasts an extensive character customization system, allowing players to fine-tune every aspect of their avatar, including gender, appearance, and class. The available classes, such as Swordmage, Occultist, Paladin, Blademaster, and Spiritshaper, provide diverse gameplay experiences.\r\nRevelation M follows the typical free-to-play Action MMORPG format on the mobile platform. A game where you can do a lot of things aside from the main story; from taking on endless dungeons and missions, joining guilds, 20 vs 20 arenas, or perhaps engaging in realistic jobs as a musician, cook, singer, or even fashion designer. Each profession offers unique activities and quests, honestly, this game packs a lot of things, but you also get a lot of automation features like auto target, auto camera, auto pathing for quests, and AFK mode for combat.\r\nThe initial presentation is very charming, introducing me to a beautiful world that feels utopic in some sense; however, the action is very few and far between. I played for a couple of hours, and I only encountered a little combat for the first hour or two of play. Most of my early experiences were a series of cutscenes, plus running, interacting with, and following NPCs, and the pacing is really very slow.  Although after that, it only gets better as you start to experience more combat and gameplay elements.\r\nThere's a need for something to hook players in the early game, and so far, this element is lacking. I wasn’t invested in the seemingly interesting story underneath all the clunkiness in presentation, especially with the robotic computer-generated voice lines. Overall, this game is promising, as the gameplay systems are great individually, but when put together, more work needs to be done to make the game feel polished and finished.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6599493) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Immortal Survivors\r\nSurvival\r\nRPG\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nImmortal Survivors is a rogue-lite arena survival game that was recently released on Android here on Taptap. It takes players on a journey through the demon-infested land of Shenzhou, as one of the warriors tasked to regain back the land\r\n## Pros\r\n- Engaging rogue-lite arena survival gameplay\r\n- Introduces “right-stick” aiming mechanics\r\n- Optimized and smooth performance## Cons\r\n-Limited skill and character variety\r\n-Energy system is a bit too restrictive\r\n-English translation could be better\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game is set in the land of Shenzhou, terrorized by the sudden appearance of the Demons. Major sects in the land united their efforts and gathered the greatest warriors to seal away the demons, one of these warriors is our character who has since been under deep stasis for five years and has just recently woken up, she finds the land even more ravaged by the demons, with humans struggling to regain the land.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe art style of Immortal Survivors is blend of traditional ancient Chinese drawings and cartoon aesthetics. It comes across a bit as kind of amateurish, but I don’t really mind, the game has a unique charm. The visual effects, especially with the different skills still look amazing. The voice acting in the cutscenes are all in Chinese, but there is a low-quality English localization for all the in-game text and dialogues. It gets its point across, but it could definitely be a lot better.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nWhen a game has word Survivors on the title, we used to think of zombies or post apocalyptic settings, nowadays, we now think of rogue-lite arena survival auto-shooter that was initially popularized by Vampire Survivors.\r\nIn these kinds of games players just need to control the character’s movements, and that’s the whole control scheme of the game. The player character automatically attacks and defends itself against waves of waves of monsters and have to survive as long as they can.\r\nImmortal Survivors ups the ante though, instead of just having the movement as a one-hand control scheme, you now have to use two hands. Control the orientation of the characters with your right hand as well as an aiming mechanics, and you can also dash now to help avoid damage. Aiming is important and many of the skills you can use are dependent on this.\r\n## ⚔️The rogue-lite factor\r\nThe two-handed control scheme adds an extra layer of skill and strategy, making every encounter feel dynamic. The auto-attack and defense mechanisms allow players to focus on movement, aiming, and skill selection. You gather EXP from fallen enemies on the map and eventually level up, which will allow you to upgrade and choose skills or attribute bonuses from a random selection. Up to five maximum skills can be equipped, from then on, you can either enhance your existing skills or you can replace them completely.\r\nSkills are only specific to that run and are not permanent. They reset every level, which forms the rogue-lite aspect of the game. I found that there’s not a lot of variety of skills to choose from, and I generally got my favorites to pick within an hour of playing the game. Having said that, you don’t always get to pick your wanted skills as the choices are always randomized, and there are many different enhancements for each skill which still makes the game fresh every run.\r\nPickups in the levels appear time to time; such as instantly destroy all enemies, health pickups, or free randomized upgrades. If  you die, you get one chance to revive, and there is an option to do via watching an Ad.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nProgrsesion is centered on advancing linearly through the levels the get progressively harder. There are multiple boss fights on each level that comes periodically, and to defeat them you must upgrade your character and his/her looted equipment. The boss fights are varied enough not to feel repetitive, but it could definitely use some more of it. There are only three characters, one centered on sword skills, one on thunder, and one on frost, although they aren’t restricted to just one element when actually choosing the skills during runs. In addition, you also have the relics tree system that serves as permanent progression globally, for all characters.\r\nAs a free-to-play game, Immortal Survivors incorporates standard monetization features. An energy/stamina system limits play — which I found to be a bit restrictive than usual, while login bonuses, weekly events, and ads for in-game bonuses are familiar components. Microtransactions offer players the option to speed up character leveling, acquire resources, or unlock characters without grinding. While there is a pay-to-progress element, it doesn't overshadow the enjoyment for players who prefer not to spend money, at least for a while.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nImmortal Survivors delivers a satisfactory performance on my snapdragon 888 device. The game runs smoothly, with a flat 60fps support and I’ve only experienced acceptable drops during intense demon-filled moments. The visual effects during combat contribute to an immersive experience. However, the lack of performance/graphics settings, and the lackluster English localization may be a point of improvement.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nImmortal Survivors offers a compelling experience for any rogue-lite arena survival enjoyers. While the story isn't groundbreaking, it serves as a suitable backdrop for the demon-slaying adventure. Whether played casually or with a more strategic focus, Immortal Survivors provides a decent rogue-lite journey through the demon-infested land of Shenzhou.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6603590) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Immortal Survivors is a recently released rogue-lite arena survival game on Android via TapTap that takes players on a journey through the demon-infested land of Shenzhou. The game boasts a distinctive art style, merging traditional Chinese drawings with cartoon graphics, offering a unique visual experience.\r\nAs the genre's one-handed control scheme evolves into a more dynamic two-handed approach for this game, Immortal Survivors introduces elements of aiming and dashing, elevating the player's engagement compared to genre flagships like Brotato and Vampire Survivors. It's almost an ARPG game now, but with auto-attack and auto-activation of skills.\r\nFor those unfamiliar, rogue-lite arena survival games have a simple but addicting formula: The player character automatically attacks and defends itself against waves of waves of monsters, and they have to survive as long as they can. During the course of the run, they become more powerful overtime, every now and then giving players choices over which skills and attributes to upgrade.\r\nWith a focus on linear progression, multiple boss fights, and a variety of characters and skills, Immortal Survivors aims to deliver an immersive experience in the world of demon-slaying.\r\nAnd it does for the most part. It's fun, engaging, and performed smoothly on my Snapdragon 888 device. Of course, there are caveats. The game is free-to-play, but there ads now and there are bits of pay to progress elements. You are also gated now with a stamina/energy system to be able to start runs, which can stop you from playing for extended periods of time, which is unfortunate for a genre this addicting.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6603588) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Rebel Bots: Epic War PvP RTS\r\n6.2\r\nStrategy\r\nPvP\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nRebel Bots: Epic War PvP Clash is a unique blend of tower defense, card-collecting, and strategic combat. The title of the game can be a mouthful, but at least it can be pretty self-explanatory as it definitely involves Rebel bots, Epic wars, and PvP clashes, indeed. Offering short yet intense battles that can keep players coming back for more. The style and feel of the game is highly reminiscent of the game popular game Clash Royale. The history of the game is deeply rooted in the NFT/Web3 game Rebel Bots - Xoil Wars; and this game was created as a 'Web2 component' to it.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Thrilling strategic depth\r\n- Battles are fast-paced and demand quick decision-making\r\n- A variety of cards and commander units to collect\r\n- Commanders can be directly ordered and moved during battle instead of being stationary towers## Cons\r\n-Disruptive pay-to-win elements; the monetization system creates an uneven playing field for all players\r\n-Some minor technical quirks like not using the full screen of my phone\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nUnlike traditional games, Rebel Bots: Epic War PvP Clash doesn't boast a complex narrative, but there is still somewhat a premise baked in it. Robots have revolved against humans, and have started a war for independence. Aiding them are also other humans who have supported these Rebel Bots and it sets the stage for the premise of PvP tower defense and strategic card battles.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nRebel Bots features a visually appealing art style that combines charming characters with vibrant and detailed arenas. The cartoony graphics not only add a touch of humor but also contribute to the accessibility of the game, making it appealing to a wide audience. The animations are smooth, and the design of the various cards reflects the creativity of the developers. The game manages to strike a balance between simplicity and visual flair, ensuring that players can easily distinguish between different units and supports during the heat of battle.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay of Rebel Bots revolves around 1v1, where players compete in real-time against opponents from around the world. Each player has a deck of eight cards with varying values depending on its power, and a resource system determines how frequently cards can be deployed. The strategic depth lies in the timing and placement of these cards, as well as the composition of the deck itself. Success requires a mix of offensive and defensive maneuvers, adaptability, and a keen understanding of your opponent's potential moves.\r\nPlayers will build their decks using a collection of cards and commanders, with each card representing a different unit or support (such as air strikes). The goal is to deploy these cards strategically, destroying the opponent's commander unit while also protecting their own commander from that fate. The commander has a special ability — such as freezing units — and can move around the arena and take direct orders from the player, while the rest of his army can only auto-attack and auto-move like in an Auto-chess fashion. There’s total of 55 cards and 10 commanders (five humans and five robots) to collect. It's a simple and pretty straightforward game that you'll probably like it or not within the first 10 minutes of playing.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nBattles are fast-paced and demand quick decision-making. It usually only takes under two minutes for the whole battle. The diverse range of cards, from swarming infantry units and bunkers to powerful Tanks and gunships, adds layers of complexity to the strategy. Successful players need to predict their opponent's moves, manage resource efficiently, and counter threats effectively. The thrill of a perfectly executed strategy or the heart-pounding intensity of a close match keeps players hooked and fosters a sense of accomplishment.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nRebel Bots employs a progression system that revolves around collecting and upgrading cards. As players win battles, they earn chests containing new cards, currency, and other resources. The more cards you collect, the stronger your deck becomes as you can directly upgrade cards with duplicates.  There's also a rank system to progress in by winning matches, unlocking a new rank will also unlock new cards and commanders. In addition, players will also have missions and milestones with corresponding rewards as well.\r\nThe progression system strikes a delicate balance, providing a sense of advancement without making it overly difficult for new players to catch up. However, the reliance on card upgrades might lead to a feeling of stagnation for players who struggle to obtain specific cards needed for their preferred strategies.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nRebel Bots utilizes a free-to-play model with in-app purchases, a common strategy in mobile gaming. Players can spend real money to purchase gems, which can be used to buy chests, or speed up the chest unlocking process. While the game is generous in providing free rewards through regular play, the monetization system creates an uneven playing field and technically makes this a P2W game.\r\nPlayers who invest real money can progress faster and possess stronger cards, potentially leading to imbalanced matchups. If even if you have the same deck with similar unit and similar placements, that player with an upgraded deck would certainly win via their damage output and defense alone. However, the game does offer some semblance of chance for free-to-play players to compete, as skill and strategy also play crucial roles in victory.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nRebel Bots: Epic War PvP Clash is played vertically on phones, and smoothly on a wide range of devices. However, there are still some bugs the I’ve experienced. First of all, the game does not use the full vertical resolution of my phone (1080x2448) for matches, and leaves a top and bottom black bar instead. I’ve also encountered an occassional game-breaking bug that completely froze the game whenever I clicked on a certain specific UI button. Having said all that, the game is generally stable perfomance wise, and I did not have any weird gameplay bugs or clunkiness.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nRebel Bots: Epic War PvP Clash is a game has successfully blended strategic depth with accessibility. Its engaging gameplay, vibrant visuals, and intuitive mechanics make it another potential go-to choice for players seeking quick, intense battles that follows the Clash Royale formula almost by the book. However, following the formula comes with some pay-to-win aspects that free-to-play players may find unfair. Still, I’d recommend a try.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6604469) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Well, the game promises to be an immersive interactive narrative experience that will test your wit and determination.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe narrative unfolds as Domino is awakened by a mysterious voice promising guidance through their mystic yet modern world filled with the manifestations of environmental degradation – plastics, pollution, global warming, and man-made climate change. Domino's mission is twofold: navigate the treacherous landscape and nurture a delicate Lilac flower, a symbol of hope. The overarching theme revolves around the interconnectedness of personal growth and environmental stewardship.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay of DOMINO: The Little One is very simple, with only two commands: jump and interact. The platformer mechanics are basic, with a double jump and gliding feature to navigate the environment. Interact is primarily used for pushing blocks around to reach higher platforms, adding a puzzle-solving element to the otherwise straightforward gameplay.\r\nThe environmental undertones are reflected not only in Domino's internal struggles but also in the puzzles and challenges encountered throughout the journey.\r\nThroughout the game, DOMINO must continuously collect floating light orbs which will nurture and fuel her Lilac flower, failing to do will result in a failure and return to the last checkpoint. This mechanic both serves as a navigational marker and time limit for players to progress.\r\nHonestly, it's less of a game and more of an interactive environmental info-video disguised as a children's book platformer with very simple game mechanics. There isn't much to do, and the controls are awful. The movement feels floaty, especially with touch controls, which were unconfigurable and unreliable.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nBesides the aforementioned awful controls, the game occasionally stutters on my Snapdragon 888 device (ROG Phone 5), even with its seemingly limited and undemanding visuals. There are no subtitles to help understand what the narrator/guide is saying, so some of the intended message – the essence of the game – might be lost on the audience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI appreciate the beautifully hand-drawn art style and the pro-environmental advocacy, but it hasn't affected me profoundly, and it probably won't resonate effectively with others as well. I prefer the approach of the game Terra Nil instead, which provides compelling strategy gameplay to complement its environmental advocacies. In my review of that game, I requested for more games like that —unfortunately, DOMINO: The Little One couldn't quite replicate that element.  I appreciate what it tries to do, but I have to be fair and rate it as a video game experience — and I'm not quite impressed.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6609960) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game falls flat as a video game experience; the gameplay is very shallow: just move, run, and jump, and even with that simple scheme the character is awful to control. The game is very short under 40 minutes and there's really no challenge nor compelling reason to play it.\r\nWhat's nice though is the hand drawn art style and the pro-environmental message it conveys. However this could have been done easily with a short series of videos instead. Having said all that, the game is completely free-to-play, no in-game ads or purchases, so the intent is really noble, just wasn't executed very well as a video game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6609959) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Titan Quest: Ultimate Edition\r\n8.4\r\nRPG\r\nAction\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nTitan Quest is an action role-playing game originally released in 2006 and has since been updated with new DLCs and ported to mobile multiple times, bringing this classic to new audiences time and time again, introducing various generation of gamers to a mythical journey through ancient civilizations.  It has stood the test of time and continues to captivate audiences across different platforms.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Premium classic ARPG experience for mobile\r\n- Deep and expansive character customization and progression\r\n- Includes all DLCs, amounting to over a hundred hours' worth of content\r\n- Controller support\r\n- Cloud saves## Cons\r\n-HUD and text sizes are smaller than I preferred\r\n-No multiplayer support\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📜Background\r\nEver since mobile games got better in quality and capability, we started getting some proper PC / Console ports with games like GTA Vice City and Star Wars: KOTOR. Another underrated game on that list is Titan Quest, one of the games that came in my radar before as a compelling alternative to Diablo for mobile phones (Before Diablo Immortal was a thing). Honestly, it’s one of my favorite classic ARPG games.\r\nWhat’s great is that it comes with a premium one-time payment model that doesn’t have any ads or pay-to-win aspects, just pure DLC content. Well, that one-time payment might have just been a lie, as Titan Quest is a title that just keeps on evolving into many forms, with good reason. Now with another rerelease as Titan Quest: Ultimate Edition, is this release the game’s final form?\r\nTitan Quest: Ultimate Edition serves as a complete compilation of the whole Titan Quest saga, and has all the updates and DLCs included. For comparison, it’s last edition — Legendary Edition, is missing the newest DLC: Eternal Embers. Luckily, it’s available as an in-app DLC purchase for roughly the difference in price between the two editions. If you already own the previous version, then you’d just want to buy the DLC separately. If you own the base game version, you can just get the DLCs inside the app. It’s kinda confusing. Actually. To summarize, the DLCs it comes with are the only difference in these editions. To clarify, there is no \"Ultimate Edition\" package on PC, only on mobile. on PC, you need to buy the base game and the DLCs separately.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet against the backdrop of a world inspired by ancient myths and historical civilizations. Titan Quest places players in the role of a hero chosen by the gods to confront mythical creatures and prevent an impending catastrophe. Initially started at as a Greek/Roman mythology inspired game, it has now evolved and expanded to more mythologies and legends with Norse, Egyptian, and Asian mythologies, among others.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nDespite its age of almost 20 years, Titan Quest's graphics have aged gracefully with its impressive lighting and clean CGI or clay-like 3D design, and recent adaptations have further enhanced the visual experience. The art style, a harmonious blend of historical accuracy and mythological fantasy, breathes life into the game's diverse environments. The adaptation to modern platforms — including the now powerful mobile platform — has allowed for improved textures, lighting effects, and overall graphical fidelity.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nTitan Quest's gameplay is rooted in the classic ARPG formula, offering a combination of exploration, combat, and character progression. It’s very similar to Diablo and commonly compared to that game for good reason. Players create a character by choosing from various classes, each representing a unique playstyle and skill set. The game encourages experimentation, allowing players experiment with different builds and playstyles.\r\nThe expansive world is divided into acts, including the DLC content in which Immortal Throne adds a fourth Act, while Ragnarok adds a fifth act and perhaps the biggest DLC out of all. The other two smaller DLCs are Atlantis and Eternal Embers and offer additional extra content and story but not added as an additional Act.\r\nThe non-linear structure enables exploration and side quests, providing a sense of freedom within the overarching narrative. The variety of environments and enemies keeps the gameplay engaging, preventing repetition as players journey through different realms.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nTitan Quest features a traditional ARPG style real-time combat system. The fluidity of combat, variety of skills; melee, ranged, or casted, combined with a diverse array of enemies, creates a fun experience that you’d usually find in ARPGs. The ragdoll system ford dying enemies was ahead of its time in 2006, and still impresses me until now.\r\nUnlike modern ARPG that focuses on mobility and fast-paced combat, Titan Quest is literally a classic or traditional ARPG like Diablo II, stationary attacks with both feet planted for the character while he/she attacks. Simply put, if you love the style of Diablo II, even the recent Resurrected edition, this game is right up your alley.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nTitan Quest boasts a comprehensive progression system that empowers players to tailor their characters through class selection, skill tree development, and attribute allocation. Character advancement primarily occurs through completing quests, earning experience points, and unlocking new skills. The story missions and Acts serve as main anchors or guides in progressing through the game.\r\nThe itemization system features a typical randomized loot system with varied rarity tiers, as players discover and equip weapons, armor, and magical artifacts. The joy of discovering a rare item after a challenging battle or and long day of farming is always a satisfying and gratifying feeling in ARPG games, and Titan Quest does not disappoint.\r\nCrafting and enchanting options further enhance gear, while set items and relics contribute to strategic customization. The intricate synergy between character progression and itemization forms the core of Titan Quest, providing a dynamic and rewarding journey through its mythological realms. A lot of builds are viable and entirely up to the player’s experimentation, and the game’s offline singleplayer oriented focus instead of a live service or pay to win system ensures that good ‘ol uninterrupted gameplay fun is prioritized over anything else.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nIt’s essential the same gaming experience with its PC counterpart, and the biggest difference mechanically is the built-in touch controls. It’s implemented decently in this case, and if you’re used to mobile MOBA or ARPG games, this won’t take any effort to get used to. In any case, physical controllers are supported, like an Xbox or PlayStation gamepad connected over bluetooth.\r\nWhen moving with the left stick on both touch and joystick controls, the character slightly glides around when stopping which makes it a bit floaty, a clear leftover from the game being originally designed as a point-and-click game for PC. The touch controls have a lot of room for improvement, for example, you can’t change the placement of UI elements, and I found the HUD to be very small, even at maximum scale setting, again another leftover from it’s PC roots.\r\nTechnical Performance\r\nSpeaking of HUD size, the text and icons are also a bit small, and this can pose a problem for other players. Reading the dialogue and identifying skill icons can be harder than usual.\r\nOn my Snapdragon 888 device, performance hovers around 60fps for the most part, and when uncapped reaching at 120fps at times especially during indoors. However, it occasionally dips to around 30s and 40s during intensive scenes and while moving around the world, which slightly takes away from the experience. Capping the frame rate to 60 or 30 if you can tolerate it, seems much better. I did encounter a minor bug with the cap being incorrectly set to 20FPS sometimes, but it’s easily solvable by changing the settings back and forth.\r\nDespite the PC version supporting multiplayer, it’s sad to report that this mobile edition currently still  does not support multiplayer. It does feature cloud save though, which is nice and allows you to protect and preserve your progress and even play back and forth on multiple mobile devices.\r\n## 💵 Pricing\r\nTitan Quest Ultimate Edition is being sold at $25, you might think it’s a little big high, but it’s actually already a great value for a decent AAA gaming experience, and this is how you get more AAA games for mobile. With the base game and it’s four DLCs included, this could potentially give players over a hundred hours of content.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nIn revisiting Titan Quest through its Ultimate Edition, I am still amazed at the developers/publishers continued support for this game and the mobile platform. The interface doesn’t feel modern, but more than ever, it offers a compelling value for a comprehensive and timeless ARPG adventure, making it and a worthwhile addition for any serious mobile ARPG gamers out there.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6611643) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "9.1\r\nBlood\r\nAction\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nI already played Hitman: Blood Money countless times since its release last 2006. From it’s previous-gen PS2 release at the time, up to the Xbox 360 and PC versions on Steam. It’s probably one of my favorite games of all time and arguably the best Hitman game of the old era. As far as fun is concerned, it can even go toe-to-toe with the recent Modern Hitman Trilogy in terms of gameplay mechanics and freedom to do your own thing, there are even elements that are still better here than in the newer games.\r\nNow to my surprise, they have actually ported this entire game to Android, and I was back again for another ride. This isn’t just another Hitman Sniper spin-off app, or a bastardization of the Hitman franchise. It’s actually a fully fledged Hitman game, with proper visuals, intuitive touch-screen plus controller support, and one time purchase to get all content.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Authentic Hitman experience\r\n- Variety of tools and approaches to eliminate targets\r\n- Very rewarding and compelling progression system\r\n- Intuitive touch controls plus physical controller support\r\n- Optimized performance and cloud saves## Cons\r\n-Interacting with multiple in-game items bunched together using the \"Tap Screen\" prompt mechanic can be frustrating\r\n-It’s not a new title, the game is almost 20 years old, high chance you have played this already\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe premise of Hitman: Blood Money revolves around a journalist named Rick Henderson who is investigating the ICA and Agent 47. The game is presented as a series of flashbacks, with the player taking on the role of Agent 47 as he recalls and reenacts past missions. As with other Hitman games, it isn’t all about assassination missions, part of what makes the series compelling is Agent 47’s personal story as well. Still, when diving in without having played the other games, it distinguishes itself as a decent standalone experience.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nOne of the major concerns when adapting a game like Hitman: Blood Money for mobile platforms is the graphical fidelity. However, Reprisal successfully maintains a commendable level of visual quality. It is even on par with the “next-gen” graphics at the time of Xbox 360, instead of the PS2 visuals.\r\nThe art style remains consistent with the Hitman series, blending realism with a touch of noir aesthetics. Lighting and shadow effects especially with the “Graphics Mode” contribute to the immersive experience, enhancing the overall visual appeal. The soundtrack still has that iconic \"Ave Maria\" masterpiece that stuck to the series ever since, even being featured in the Hitman Hollywood film.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay mechanics remain 1:1 the same with the original, emphasizing stealth, strategy, and meticulous planning. Turning this game into a shooter is not encouraged, but the developers have done a commendable job in implementing aim-assist regardless.\r\nPlayers are presented with a variety of tools and approaches to eliminate targets, encouraging creativity in execution. The Hitman series has always been praised for its sandbox-style levels, and Reprisal just maintains this aspect, allowing players to explore and experiment in open-ended environments. That’s why I see it as the best classic game in the series, because it’s perhaps what laid the foundation for the excellent modern Hitman Trilogy we have today.\r\nThe game's structure encourages replayability, with multiple ways to approach each mission and hidden points of interest to discover. Whether players prefer a silent and methodical approach or a more aggressive playstyle, The levels are truly a blank canvas for players to paint blood on.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe transition to touch controls is a significant aspect of Reprisal, and it's executed with surprising finesse. Controlling Agent 47 feels intuitive, with a virtual joystick for movement and a well-implemented touch interface for actions such as aiming, shooting, and interacting with the environment.\r\nEach action has their own icons and intuitive placement depending on the detected situation. Stand in front of a door and a proper to “Tap to Open” comes up, the “attack” icon/button changes depending on the weapon you’ve equipped. They gave an extra effort in implementing these things, instead of just slapping a virtual joystick and calling it a day (Looking at you, Resident Evil: Village on iOS).\r\nStill, it might take a time to get used to, especially if you're so used to controlling Agent 47 using controllers and mouse/keyboards. Fortunately, the touch screen button placements are all customizable. My only gripe is that many interactions are dependent on the \"Tap screen\" prompt mechanic, and this can get messy when there are so many interactibles in close proximity with each other, and you can't quite select what you want and have to move in small steps.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nReprisal mirrors the progression system of its predecessor, rewarding players for completing missions with money (or should I say Blood Money), money that can be used to unlock new weapons, gadgets, and upgrades. Honestly, this is the peak of Hitman series in terms of progression, and in my opinion, still beats the modern games that rely on milestones and challenges to unlock weapons and gizmos. The news reports that highlights your performance in each mission at the end is also a nice touch that has never been done again.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game performed smoothly like butter on my Snapdragon 888 device, hovering at around 40 FPS when using the default “Performance” graphics setting. It never felt sluggish or had any stutters. In fact, it felt even smoother than the 40FPS that I was seeing in my monitoring tool, which means the frametimes are stable. When using the “Graphics” setting which is the highest, my performance dropped to around 30 FPS. Honestly, all it does is make the game slightly more bloomier, so I reverted back to the default setting.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6615533) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Move around like in a 2D platformer Metroidvania game, jump, climb, and dash to avoid hazards... or maybe deflect attacks with a well timed parry.\r\nThe demo allows us a peek into the first 30 minutes of the game’s story so far. It follows our cat-looking hero Yi and his vengeful quest against the 9 Sols. The early parts of the game are set around a peaceful village called New Kunlun, with ancient-style technology and optimistic primitive humans living in it. As far as the introduction and premise is concerned, it’s a very compelling story that left me wanting for more as soon as the Demo ended after the first boss fight.\r\nOverall, I was genuinely surprised with Nine Sols in terms of its terrific hand-drawn art style and challenging 2D combat, and I can't wait until next year to finally continue the story and see more of the game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6613433) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The whole game is set in one expansive map, and your city there is placed with other players, forming its MMO component, where you can also join guilds and sieges together with other players.\r\nUnlike traditional city-builders where you can place structure individually, Infinite Borders features monolithic castles with upgrades managed through a research or skill-tree-like system. The addictive nature of upgrading buildings and expanding territories keeps players engaged, aligning with the game's strategic focus.\r\nResource is hard to come by and generated in real-time, so you might have to wait for a few hours or even days to gather enough resources. The same goes for marching armies, constructions, and basically doing anything worthwhile to progress your castle in the game.\r\nThe mechanics are confusing at first, but they get better in time, especially for beginners that are given massive rewards such as resources and currencies to boost their early game progression. Once it clicks, the whole system becomes somewhat addicting, with the only thing stopping me from playing is the actual need for waiting in real-time.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat in Infinite Borders is resolved automatically between armies, determined by power and army levels. The strategic element lies in forming and upgrading unique teams of heroes leading their own armies, each with distinct skills and abilities. Gacha mechanics come into play here, as recruiting heroes becomes a vital part of your strategy. Battles are presented and can be replayed in a RTS-style view, although oddly enough there are no sounds during these segments and the system feels very clunky and unfinished.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nInfinite Borders excels in creating an addictive sense of growth and improvement. The constant upgrading of buildings, conquering new lands, and expanding territories contribute to a rewarding progression system. The hero collection aspect adds further depth, with over 300 heroes to recruit. Players can work towards enhancing their teams, unlocking new strategic possibilities, and experimenting with different hero combinations.\r\nHowever, the game's progression is not without its challenges. The stamina system and real-world waiting periods for actions such as construction, research, and troop travel time can test a player's patience. While the slow pace encourages a long-term investment in the game, it may frustrate those looking for quick and rewarding sessions.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThis creates a constant pressure of speeding up things, in either skipping the wait, or the chance of acquiring character. This is where the in-app purchases and pay-to-win elements comes in. In-app purchases can be used for various purposes, including speeding up construction, acquiring heroes, or obtaining in-game advantages. While the game does offer opportunities to earn in-game currency through grinding, the option to spend real money for quicker progression is very enticing.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nInfinite Borders is commendable for its dual graphics setting; A visually pleasing 3D graphics, real-time weather changes, and alternative 2D mode for smoother performance on low-end devices. The game manages to maintain a visually engaging experience while accommodating different hardware capabilities. While the game ran adequately on my Snapdragon 888 device, I experienced intense lag when zooming out of the expansive world map.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nInfinite Borders is an intriguing strategy and city-building game that captures the atmosphere of the Three Kingdoms period in ancient China. Its addictive nature, empire building mechanics, and in-depth hero collection mechanics make it a compelling choice for players with a fondness for both the MMO strategy genre and it’s three kingdoms historical setting.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6619882) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "ColorBANGTest Global\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nAction\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nColorBANG is a 3v3 fast-paced casual top-down shooter and coloring game where players engage in exciting territorial battles involving color. Players win matches through strategic spraying, killing, and use of abilities. The game is currently in a Closed Beta Test phase that runs from November 28 to December 12, 2023, full data will be wiped after the test. The actual release date for the game is still TBA.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nThere is no narrative or background lore whatsoever but the premise is basically a futuristic world populated by humans and robots, and for some reason everyone is hell bent on spreading their color on everything they see. This sets the stage for the “Turf Wars” going on between team Pink and team Teal.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nColorBANG features cartoonish character design with exaggerated features, small bodies, and large heads, it uses a bright and vibrant color palette enhancing the overall cheerful and color-based nature of the game. The graphics look good even on the lowest resolution settings, and the vibrant colors are well-integrated into the gameplay. It’s clean looking, and fits well with the casual coloring theme of the ColorBANG.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay and Combat\r\nThe goal of the 3v3 matches is to cover the arena with their team’s color, players get assigned to either team Pink or team Teal. The team that covers most of the field when the time’s up wins. You really have to roam the map and cover area as much as possible. Opposing teams can override each others paint, so it becomes a continuous color tug-of-war for territory until the 150 second timer runs out.\r\nSince it's also a top-down auto-shooter, killing enemies are part of the game, and the dead will have to respawn after 5 seconds. However, there is no incentive to get the most frags in the game. There is only a limited amount of ammunition per character, and they have to spread paint across the surface to reload. Even acquiring your character’s special ability random power-ups require spreading paint to charge up. These power-ups range from healing beacons, paint bombs, or a dash ability that replenishes all ammo.\r\nMost of the gameplay elements encourage players to spread paint on the map, and I love how kills and deaths don't matter as long as you gain more territory than others. If a team decides to approach it as a team deathmatch game, they'll lose the majority of the time. You can even play as passively, spreading paint on empty or unguarded territory, winning without ever encountering an enemy; or you can assert dominance and push enemies away by directly confronting them or negating what they are spraying on.\r\nColorBANG becomes a balancing act between ammo consumption, aggressiveness, and capturing territory. Honestly, it’s a very fun and refreshing game to play. The mechanics closely resemble the Nintendo Switch game Splatoon’s paint/territory mechanics, but I actually prefer ColorBANG’s more casual, top-down gameplay that is more accessible and easier to grasp.\r\n## ⏫Progression and Monetization\r\nThe game is very small scale for now, with only six characters and a basic progression system involving accumulation of star coins through continuous play. As you play, characters and skins are unlocked. The six characters differ in how they are played. For example, Reno is more of a rapid fire character with a rapid fire weapon, moderate HP, and high spray rate; while Piper is a much more Tanky unit with fewer max ammo, AOE attacks, and slow spray rate. The maps on the other hand automatically rotate every few minutes, with no way to choose what you want to play in.\r\nFor now, the game is entirely free-to-play, and I haven’t seen any in-game shop or gacha mechanics in place yet. However, it includes traditional live service elements such as quests, login bonuses, and leaderboards. It's possible that more characters and game elements will be added as we move towards the release.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWhile the visuals are good, performance is a bit of a mixed bag, while there are moments of 60FPS fluidity, I’ve experienced random but massive FPS drops on my Snapdragon 888 device. This is even running on the game’s lowest resolution setting. The game also offers 30 or 60FPS mode.Additionally, I've encountered some network errors (lag) that are likely due to server issues. It’s worth noting that this Review is based on December 2023 Closed Beta Test and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nColorBANG brings a burst of vibrant fun to the gaming scene with its unique blend of a 3v3 top-down shooter and engaging in territorial battles filled with color. Seriously, this is another game to watch for those looking for a refreshing and casual experience for the mobile platform. I just hope it heads into the right direction by avoiding unfair pay-to-win pitfalls and embracing a balanced and player-friendly monetization model.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6620927) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Grand Theft Auto VI\r\n8.6\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nThe long-awaited moment has arrived — after 10 long years — Rockstar Games finally drops the highly anticipated first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI this December 5, 2023. After an anticlimactic leak a few months ago (It was a disappointing news for Rockstar Games, but exciting news for us), We finally have an official look at the game, and it releases in 2025.\r\nKey Features Revealed:\r\nSet in Vice City\r\nFirst female protagonist\r\nDual characters; Lucia and Jason\r\nReleases 2025\r\nSet in Vice City\r\nFirst female protagonist\r\nDual characters; Lucia and Jason\r\nReleases 2025\r\nThe trailer confirms many of the leaked rumors spreading the net, and unleashes a lot of new information. These were just rumors before, so it’s always nice to have official confirmation. Vice City? Check. Dual Characters? Check. The first female protagonist? Check. Humungous map? Check.\r\nIt looks amazing, honestly. The graphics look way better than any Rockstar Games title so far. The hype is very real. If the leap in gameplay and immersion is anything like in the masterpiece Red Dead Redemption 2 or the timeless GTA V which was released across a whopping three different console generations (e.g., PS3, PS4, PS5), then it’s highly likely Rockstar, having taken their sweet time with GTA VI, is going to pull it off yet again.\r\n## 🎮Platforms (Console? PC? Mobile?)\r\nIn a separate article, Rockstar Games has just confirmed that it's currently planned for the two current-gen systems, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. There’s also no indication of a PC version yet, but if history is any indication, it will probably release a year of two right after the console release. Of course, being a huge fan of GTA, I’ll probably double dip again — meaning I’ll buy the console version and then buy the PC version again. Nintendo will probably once again miss out on this new Rockstar AAA game, but that could soon change if the rumors about a Switch successor releasing next year turn out to be true.\r\nNow, GTA VI is cool and all, but for mobile gamers, on the other hand, when can we expect a mobile release for GTA V? We already have the classic games like GTA Vice City and San Andreas for iOS and Android, so one can only hope they can release at least GTA IV and V as well… and soon. Well, you will probably need a 50GB free size storage to install GTA V.\r\n## 📊Possible System Requirements\r\nWhen examining the possible system requirements for GTA V's hypothetical PC release in 2024 or 2025, we could use history to make an educated guess. When GTA V and RDR 2 were released, their minimum system requirements specified mid/high-tier GPUs from five years prior and even older on CPUs, around 5 years older or more.\r\nSo, if GTA V for PC were to be released in 2026 or 2027, its minimum requirements might involve a GPU released in 2020 or 2021, such as the RTX 2070 or RTX 3060. The CPU requirement could be something like an i7-8700k or Ryzen 5 3600, aligning with the CPUs of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6629538) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "CAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACEGlobal\r\n9.0\r\nSports\r\nACG\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nCAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE is a mobile online competitive football / soccer game with gacha elements and real-time gameplay. Players can engage in various modes, such as singleplayer and training matches, seasonal asynchronous PvP, and a real-time 4v4 PvP mode as well.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Intense Anime-esque presentation\r\n- Variety of game modes: singleplayer, story, async PvP, real-time PvP\r\n- Engaging progression and team building\r\n- Fun to use skills and abilities for each character\r\n## Cons\r\n- Needs work on its fluidity and player-to-player animations/interactions\r\n- No live commentary from players or announcers during matches\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nCAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE is presented in a familiar cel-shaded anime art style, showcasing Anime-style character designs and vivid environments. The visual effects are simply dazzling, especially during the cinematic presentation of skill moves such as Drive Shot and Face Block, Although the animations can get repetitive quite easily. The presentation features upbeat style music that fits the tone of the game, but there is no live commentary from players or announcers.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay involves controlling the entire team in an arcade-style soccer experience. The game is all about precise passes, powerful shots, and skillful dribbles or tackles that offer a satisfying level of control. Special abilities and their matching animations make simple moves like tackles, passes, and shots more pronounced and satisfying to perform. It successfully showcases intense Anime-esque soccer battles, providing an exciting experience that puts players in the shoes of characters like Tsubasa Oozora and Taro Misaki.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nControls are streamlined to ensure a swift and intuitive experience. The simplicity of the control scheme enables players to execute precise passes, unleash powerful shots, and perform skillful dribbles with ease, designed to provide players with accessibility and engagement. The controls are crafted to be user-friendly, allowing both newcomers and experienced players to quickly grasp it.\r\nWhile the gameplay and presentation is enjoyable overall, CAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE falls short in terms of fluidity. The game feels and looks clunky in player on player interactions such as tackles or passes. However, when the players are instead locked-in and enters a cinematic style of animation for the special moves, it really looks good and action-packed.\r\nAs for the passes, it’s kinda awkward sometimes, as players often come to a complete standstill until the ball reaches them, disrupting the flow of the game. Additionally, the player switching mechanism that I encountered during the CBT is still the same, it could be improved to prioritize the most appropriate defender, preventing frustrating situations where the game switches to a player positioned too far behind from the opponent.\r\n## 📜Progression and Game Modes\r\nIn CAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE, unlike other Anime style gacha games, the main anchor of progression is not about advancing the main story, it’s all about increasing your team’s level and just having fun with all the game modes it offers. It immediately comes right after the pretty short but substantial tutorial which should be used by other developers more often, I was basically left to do my own thing, which is liberating. I don’t have to sit through an hour or more long introduction and tutorial before I could finally “play” a game.\r\nProgression includes leveling up or getting new characters, enhancing skills, and altering cosmetics. However, the reliance on gacha mechanics, makes this a pay to win game by technically, impacting competitive fairness. Gacha mechanics are integral, allowing players to collect powerful characters. However, it didn’t let me stop from enjoying the game’s soccer-filled gameplay.\r\nThere is a plethora of content to keep players busy, especially for those who truly love the premise and concept. Whether participating in single-player matches like the 'Passionate Journey' levels and the 'Champion’s Journey' story mode; or simply focusing on training your players and farming for gears in various Training and Tactics modes, the game offers a diverse range of activities.\r\nPlayers can also engage in competitive real-time PvP ranked matches called ‘ Ace Showdown’ and or asynchronous PvP in seasonal matchups called 'Dream League,'The Dream League introduces an asynchronous PvP format where players' teams are matched with those of other players. The unique aspect of this mode is that the opposing teams are controlled by artificial intelligence (AI).  While Ace Showdown is a distinct PvP mode that deviates from the traditional team-based format. In this mode, players assume control of a single character and participate in 4v4 matches. AI goalies assist both sides, adding an extra layer of strategy to individual gameplay.\r\n## ⚽How does it compare to EA SPORTS FC Tactical or EA SPORTS FC Mobile?\r\nHonestly, it directly compares to both games very well. On paper, CAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE is much closer to EA SPORTS FC Mobile, with its real-time player controlled arcade matches, however it’s dazzling cinematic approach to action and animations also feels like EA SPORTS FC Tactical, especially if you activate the Tactical Autopilot mode which basically automatically controls your team.\r\nThis tactical mode allows you to let the AI take control of the match, and possibly win by itself, provided that your team and its players are strong enough. It’s not fully turn-based like FC Tactical, but it’s at least as automated and action-packed; and you can always retake control anytime.\r\nCAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE takes this feature to another level by introducing a “Fast Track” option for singleplayer matches, which can automatically end the match if all the Star conditions are met; such as scoring two more points, or not allowing more than 3 goals.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nCAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE is a decent soccer game, offering an action-packed soccer experience in a gacha package. I would have given this an 8/10 score easily if only the game was a little more fluid in terms of player-to-player interactions.Still, the game's plethora of game modes and intense presentation can make it a worthwhile choice for Anime and Soccer fans, and is a decent challenger for heavy hitters like EA SPORTS FC Mobile and EA SPORTS FC Tactical.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6629638) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Dimension Hunter\r\nAction\r\nRoguelike\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nDimension Hunter is a roguelike pixel art twin stick mobile shooter takes players in a journey through ever-changing dimensions filled with vicious monsters. As players navigate dungeons, confront challenging bosses, and explore diverse environments, the dynamic nature of Dimension Hunter keeps each playthrough fresh and exciting.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Diverse levels and bosses\r\n- Plenty of possible upgrades that add variety and experimentation\r\n- Fluid controls\r\n- A well implemented aim-assist option## Cons\r\n-Energy system is a bit too restrictive\r\n-No compelling reason to try out new characters due to the imbalance\r\n-English translation could be better\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nIn Dimension Hunter, players assume the role of dimension hunters, warriors tasked with traversing various dimensions to eradicate monstrous threats. Set in a multidimensional setting filled with monsters, magical users, and futuristic weaponry.\r\nThis world was once led by a figure named Frank, who established a prospering society blending technology and magic. However, he has gone missing since, setting the stage for the game's events to commence. There's almost no narrative here aside from the premise; the game immediately hands you the reins to the open-ended roguelite as soon as the tutorial ends.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nDimension Hunter adopts a pixel art style with vibrant color design that complements its multidimensional theme. The environments are detailed, showcasing the diversity of each dimension with unique landscapes and color palette. The character design, especially that of the heroes and monsters, is highly imaginative and contributes to the overall immersive experience. It’s a mix of fantasy, futuristic, and retro gaming themes. The action-packed music and sound effects are serviceable but I find it a bit lacking in music soundtrack and overall atmosphere.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nDimension Hunter's gameplay revolves around a combination of roguelike and twin stick shooter elements in a linear progression of levels and dungeons. Left stick to move, and right touch to shoot and use abilities. The gameplay is simple, just evade enemy projectiles and attacks, and inflict your own damage. Clear the rooms one by one, until you get to choose which upgrade and room to enter next.\r\n## 🌍The multidimensional world\r\nThere’s so many chapters and levels in the game. The first chapter alone has 12 areas, with 3 dungeons each. And you’ll probably not get far with one sitting, as each dungeon run costs 5 energy points out of 30 total, and you’ll bound to ran out within the first few minutes. Unlike in other games, there’s no abundance energy bonuses for beginners to get you hooked to the game aside from spending your Gems, watching ads, or spending money\r\n## 🆙The rogue-lite progression\r\nThe game’s rogue-liteness comes with temporary upgrades only specific for that level alone — not all progress is reset or start from scratch, even the weapons and level progress are retained.\r\nDuring runs, there’s so many types of possible upgrades and augments that it’s fun even just thinking about them and the possible combinations. There many elemental upgrade types like Fire, Lightning, and Ice, as well as the ability to modify your weapon.\r\nYou can have an upgrade that add elemental damages to your projectiles, or perhaps summons ice spirits upon activation of skills, or a persistent lightning orbs that circle the player inflicting passive damage. Weapon modifications that duplicate all projectiles, bounce them around enemies and walls, or perhaps adds perpendicular projectiles to both sides. No level run will be the same.\r\nNPCs are scattered across the levels that provide you different services. Trading modifications, upgrading them, or maybe just increasing your HP or Shield just before that boss fight. One thing surprised me is that you can even fight some of the merchants, if you want an additional challenge with a matching reward. Speaking of boss fights, there are multiple bosses within a given run, and you’d have to defeat all of them to clear the dungeon. The bosses are as diverse as the levels, with varying attack patterns and projectiles to master and evade.\r\nAfter each level, the modifications reset, but you can increase your character’s overall power by gathering equipment and weapons, and then upgrading them. You can also upgrade your character’s attributes and assign points to a Talent Tree system.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe controls are fluid, the characters move without problems and I have no issues evading the bullet-hell coming my way. The built-in auto-aim is nice; I don’t have to actually aim exactly at the enemies, I can just hold the right fire button to kill enemies, but the option to manually aim is still there. It’s a bit powerful compared to manual aim, but not powerful enough to make it unfairly boring.\r\nHowever, the controls aren’t perfectly, especially when interacting with NPCs scattered around the map, I can’t count the times I’ve accidentally shot NPCs because it’s hard to position my character to interact with them.\r\n## 🥷Characters\r\nThere are different characters to choose from, which costs Gem to unlock. They’re pretty easy and cheap to unlock so there’s no pressure to spend money in this element. Each character has their own talent tree to progress into, special ability, and starting weapons.\r\nEach character will also have their own separate equipment slots and weapons equipped. This is nice and all, but I found the characters a bit imbalanced and weak after playing my first character for a while, especially the Melee-based character which is just poorly implemented with the gameplay that it dies so easily with no way to mitigate the damage, that playing ranged is 100% the better option.There was no compelling reason for me to play or even try a new character since they all start very weak.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nDimension Hunter is a free-to-play online game, with in-game purchases, energy system to limit play, and optional ads implemented in the gameplay system. In-game purchases come in the form of more currency, cosmetics, equipment, and energy. While the optional ads come in the form of providing extra rewards and a free revive if you die on a run.\r\nThe free-to-play experience is viable, but players are inevitably gated and pressured to spend in two major ways: the energy system and the character’s power level. Even if you want to grind for free, you can’t because of the energy system, as a result it’s hard to recommend this game to all the heavy free-to-play grinders out there.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nDimension Hunter ran smoothly, as expected for its pixel art visuals. I think it’s safe to say that most phones will work with this game, it even stayed in the background without restarts; I had it minimized for quite a while and when I opened it, I was back in the game like nothing happened. I did however notice that it still runs when completely disconnected from the internet, even if you login and “select” a server in the main menu.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDimension Hunter delivers an engaging and vibrant roguelike experience with its multidimensional theme and dynamic gameplay. The extensive world, diverse upgrades, and challenging progression system contribute to the game's depth. While it's nearly a great rogue-lite shooter, there are issues with character balancing and minor control quirks, and overall It's hard to recommend this game to all the heavy free-to-play grinders out there, as the energy system is too restrictive.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6630382) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With engaging seasonal events and a captivating story mode, CAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE combines gacha elements for team-building with an over-the-top anime presentation, showcasing dazzling special abilities.\r\nOn the other hand, EA SPORTS FC Tactical takes a turn-based approach, introducing strategic elements into the football mobile gaming. Despite being in its early access stage, the game exhibits solid performance and impressive visuals, maintaining a consistent 60fps even in high graphics settings. The tactical turn-based matches offer a unique twist to traditional football gameplay, focusing on strategic decision-making rather than direct player control. EA SPORTS FC Tactical features various game modes, including single-player progression, friend matches, limited-time events, and multi-game leagues. Notably, it uses real-world soccer teams and players, appealing to fans who follow the sport in real life.\r\n## 🎰They're both gacha and online\r\nBoth games have team-management and player collecting elements, season, events, and live-service features, as well as gacha mechanics play a pivotal role in team-building. Additionally, both titles share an over-the-top style presentation, featuring vibrant visuals and dynamic animations for special abilities, creating a visually captivating experience.\r\n## 📺Both are visually captivating, with elements of automation / auto play\r\nOn paper, CAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE is much closer to EA SPORTS FC Mobile, with its real-time player controlled arcade matches, however it’s dazzling cinematic approach to action and animations feels similar to EA SPORTS FC Tactical, especially if you activate the Tactical Autopilot mode which basically automatically controls your team.\r\nThis tactical mode allows you to let the AI take control of the match, and possibly win by itself, provided that your team and its players are strong enough. It’s not fully turn-based like FC Tactical, but it’s at least as automated and action-packed; and you can always retake control anytime.\r\nCAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE takes this feature to another level by introducing a “Fast Track” option for single player matches, which can automatically end the match if all the Star conditions are met; such as scoring two more points, or not allowing more than 3 goals.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nUltimately, the choice between the two depends on individual preferences, with CAPTAIN TSUBASA: ACE catering to those seeking dynamic, real-time soccer action with anime flair, while EA SPORTS FC Tactical appeals to players desiring a more strategic and methodical football experience. Each game brings its unique strengths to the table, providing distinct options within the football gaming genre.\r\nAt the end of the day, both games have their unique strengths and weaknesses, catering to different preferences within the football gaming community.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6629765) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "It has been a wild ride for gamers throughout 2023. From early-year contenders like Hogwarts Legacy and Resident Evil 4 to clutch latecomers like Alan Wake 2 and Spider-Man 2, it's been a very crowded year. A solid collection of masterpiece remakes, worthy innovative sequels, and refreshing new IPs.\r\nWith dual Nintendo entrants such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and the out-of-nowhere masterpiece Baldur's Gate 3, this is perhaps one of the greatest years for gaming in recent times. Most of these games could easily win Game of the Year if released in another year.\r\nAs the year ends, it's my pleasure to present to you a collection of titles that have defined this year in gaming. Unlike conventional countdowns, our Top 10 games of 2023 are not constrained by the order of quality, reflecting the wild and unpredictable ride this year has offered. Note that this is mostly limited to the games that I reviewed here on TapTap... the good news is, I've reviewed a LOT of games, and played a whole bunch more.\r\n### Hogwarts Legacy\r\nAn early 2023 contender, Hogwarts Legacy faithfully captures the atmosphere of the Wizarding World, and creates a fantastic Hogwarts experience with a gripping story in-line with the lore and gives us a world full of wonder and magic. The RPG elements might be a little too light and the world is not as sandboxy as one might expect, but overall, it is a masterpiece that lives up to the hype and THE quintessential Harry Potter game we’ve always dreamed of.\r\n### Dead Space\r\nDead Space Remake is another hit in the series and a return to form with its immersive and atmospheric gameplay coupled with a decent story that built and improved upon the original. Tailored to both long-time fans and newcomers alike, it is a masterful example on how to remake a classic game and leverage genre maturity and modern technology to make it even better. Now I’m torn between wanting a proper remake of Dead Space 2 and 3, or a full-blown Dead Space 4. Maybe they should take the Capcom route and just do things simultaneously.\r\n### Resident Evil 4 Global\r\nResident Evil 4 is definitely a worthy remake of the original game, and perhaps the best remake Capcom has put out so far. Simply a beautiful reimagining of a classic masterpiece that manages to raise the bar even higher for remakes in general, and proves to us that even a masterpiece such as 2005’s Resident Evil 4 can still benefit from some improvements. Unless you get spooked so easily by its survival horror themes, this is a game that I would highly recommend to all fans of the action-adventure genre, and definitely a must-buy for any Resident Evil fan.\r\n### Starfield\r\nStarfield offers an expansive and immersive RPG experience. Its captivating graphics, awe-inspiring soundtrack, and dual first / third-person gameplay contribute to a sense of being in a living, believable universe. The game's vast open worlds, space exploration, and outpost building provide numerous activities to engage in. The game itself is already wide and massive, and players can expect hundreds of hours of gaming even well beyond the main story. With more than a thousand planets to explore — albeit many of them barren and empty — there’s plenty of room for growth in both via modding and future expansions. Absolutely worth playing if your system can handle it.\r\n### Sea of Stars\r\nThe only one I was not able to write a review about, but nonetheless deserves a spot on this list, is Sea of Stars. It stands as a shining testament to the potential of retro-style indie games. Sea of Stars successfully modernizes the genre, earning acclaim for its visuals, soundtrack, and gameplay. It not only pays homage to the past but also carves its own place as a modern classic, offering players a memorable and immersive experience in a vast, interconnected universe.\r\n### Alan Wake 2\r\nAlan Wake II an ambitious game that manages to deliver on its ambitious goals, offering an innovative and terrifying experience executed with confidence and expertise built from years of experience. The sequel retains the essence of the original game while expanding its scope and narrative complexity. Sure, the pacing could be a little bit better, but the game's survival horror elements, combat system, and progression mechanics are well-implemented nonetheless, making it a modern classic in the horror genre. The game introduces intriguing meta-narrative elements, further enhancing its appeal to fans of Remedy's previous works and the Remedy Connected Universe.\r\n### Marvel’s Spider-Man 2\r\nSpider-Man 2 swings into action with the weight of high expectations and delivers an experience that doesn't disappoint. The game's story and premise offer a captivating experience that balances the superhero personas of Peter Parker and Miles Morales with their personal lives, providing a richer and more emotionally resonant experience. As said earlier, Spider-Man 2 is not just a sequel; it's a continuation of a beloved series that builds upon its predecessors in all the right ways. It's a game that respects the legacy of the character while introducing new elements to keep players engaged and entertained. Even at $70 and the potential cost of buying a new console, this game is undoubtedly worth swinging into your gaming collection.\r\n### The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (NS)\r\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is another masterpiece that sets an even higher standard for open-world gaming. With its boundless exploration, creative gameplay mechanics, and a masterful emergent storytelling, it is an experience that will leave players in awe for years to come. Whether you're a longtime fan of the franchise or a newcomer to the series, this game is an absolute must-play for the Switch and a testament to the magic of video games. A potential GOTY for 2023.\r\n### Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder\r\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder is a delightful, whimsical, and mind-bending experience that pushes the boundaries of what a 2D platformer can be, both for you and your friends. In a gaming world filled with endless quests and artificial rewards, Wonder stands out for offering a different kind of satisfaction – the joy of playing itself. It's likely Nintendo's swan song for the Switch, and they're certainly leaving with a masterpiece of a bang, before the potential launch of their new console next year.\r\n### Baldur's Gate 3\r\nLast but definitely the best, Baldur's Gate 3 is a monumental achievement in the realm of RPG gaming, solidifying its place among the genre's masterpieces and delivering an experience that bridges the gap between real-life D&D and video games. The complexity of its systems, alongside its vast world and intricate storytelling, creates a rare and fulfilling gaming experience that leaves players yearning for more. As my personal Game of the Year, It is truly the quintessential cRPG and Dungeons & Dragons game, and a benchmark for those who aspire to follow in its footsteps.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6630720) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "It's been an exhilarating journey for mobile gamers in 2023. From simple casual and retro games to complex high budget ARPGs and even Triple A titles, the mobile gaming landscape has been nothing short of dynamic. The platform has been exponentially growing and starting to take over even the PC and Console space, and it's only going to get better.\r\nThis year has seen a robust collection of new anime adaptations, fresh titles, and impressive ports making their mark on the small screen, mirroring the diversity and quality present in their big brother counterparts, PC and Console.\r\nAs the year draws to a close, I'm delighted to present a collection of my favorite titles that I've played on mobile on both iOS and Android, strictly not in order. This is only based on my taste and preferences, as a primarily an all-around gamer that plays games in all kinds of platforms, mobile games included.\r\nNote that this list is primarily based on the games I've had the pleasure of playing and reviewing here on TapTap, and as much as possible, I only chose those who have been official released, not in beta testing or early access. Nonetheless, it is a diverse and comprehensive perspective on the year's mobile gaming landscape.\r\n### GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE\r\nGoddess of Victory: Nikke, or Nikke is a free-to-play sci-fi shooter that has garnered attention for its action-packed gameplay and, well, it's rather unique exaggerated physics. The game features a cast of buxom waifu characters, each armed to the teeth and ready for action. While the gameplay itself is no joke, what really sets Nikke apart is its over the shoulder and cover action, and playful approach to character movement, where the recoil from shooting causes certain assets to, shall we say, exhibit quite noticeable jiggle. It's unapologetically over-the-top, and players have embraced it for its fan service fun.\r\n### Snowbreak: Containment Zone\r\nIt delivers a satisfying gaming experience for fans of the PvE shooter genre and those who enjoy collecting and customizing waifu characters.  The fun combat, intriguing storyline, and stunning visuals make it a game worth trying out.\r\n### Resident Evil Village\r\nResident Evil Village for iOS is not a perfect port, and there are still plenty of room for improvement, but this game in this list signifies something big is coming for mobile game. Something triple A in nature and I'm excited for what's to come.\r\nIt's arrival on mobile devices marks an exciting AAA expansion into mobile gaming courtesy of Apple and Capcom. On mobile devices, it still provides a solid AAA gaming experience, especially for those who appreciate the horror genre and are okay with the compromises to the visuals/performance for portability.\r\n### Aether Gazer\r\nWhile it may have some minor flaws, Aether Gazer's visual quality, production values, and intense combat may make it a worthwhile adventure for fans of action-oriented gacha RPGs. If you prefer directly controlling your characters in an action-packed hack and slash gameplay instead of the usual auto-combat and idle gameplay, this game is worth a try.\r\n### Coromon Global\r\nCoromon captures the essence of classic monster-taming RPGs while injecting its own unique personality into the mix. Its appealing pixel art evokes nostalgia while offering a fresh perspective. T\r\nhe gameplay of Coromon is not groundbreaking nor innovative,  but you don’t always need those qualities when the game understands its purpose and remains enjoyable at the end of the day. With its tactical turn-based battles, diverse creature collection, and an engaging evolution system, all available with a free trial and a $5 upfront cost to unlock everything else, without hidden microtransactions, trying out Coromon is a choice you can't go wrong with.\r\n### Battle Chasers: Nightwar\r\nThe game's engaging storyline, strategic gameplay elements, and visually stunning art style create an immersive experience that effectively translates the essence of the comic series into video game format. Despite minor issues with map design and touch controls, Battle Chasers: Nightwar delivers a unique and unforgettable journey, making it a must-play for RPG enthusiasts on the mobile platform.\r\n### Honkai: Star RailGlobal\r\nOne of the only games that I was not able to Review here on TapTap but is nonetheless a stellar game, Honkai: Star Rail seamlessly blends captivating storytelling with engaging gameplay. The game's stunning visuals, strategic battles, and a diverse cast of characters contribute to an immersive experience that keeps players hooked. Its successful integration of the Honkai Impact universe ensures a familiar yet refreshing adventure for fans.  With its well-executed mechanics, compelling narrative, and high production values, Honkai: Star Rail stands out as another great example of a free-to-play game with a high production value and stellar support, done right.\r\n### Hitman: Blood Money — Reprisal\r\nFor those mobile players dreaming of playing the new Hitman games on their phones, this is the next best thing to that and arguably an even better experience, provided that you haven’t played this old gem yet. You just have to swallow the upfront cost in exchange for a decent premium title, without any ads or in-game purchases.\r\n### Brotato\r\nBrotato is a highly addictive Vampire Survivors-like game that is perfect to play on mobile phones with its mindless one handed controls and simplistic yet addicting gameplay mechanics. For those unfamiliar with the genre, it’s basically a bullet-hell wave roguelite survival game, where you control only the movement of your character, and all the skills and damage dealers just fire automatically. It’s almost an idle game of sorts, but you still have to move the character to avoid the waves of enemies and projectiles that can kill you, or in simpler terms, a moving lone tower defense game.\r\nEveryone should just try it, whether you are a Vampire Survivors veteran or a newcomer to the genre.\r\n###Vampire Survivors\r\nVampire Survivors is a game so great and iconic it created its own genre - the survival one hander rogue-lite genre. A perfect example of graphics doesn’t matter. Even if you’re one who usually cares for graphics in a game, even if you don’t like what you’re seeing from the screenshots and videos, I’d still recommend giving it a try and experiencing it yourself, especially that it is now completely free-to-play for Mobile, without any ads or pay-to-win schemes.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6630972) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Need for Speed™ MobileGlobal\r\n8.6\r\nRacing\r\nMultiplayer\r\nPre-register\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nNeed for Speed Mobile is an open-world arcade racing game made specifically for mobile, and an adaptation of one of the most popular video game racing franchises. The game is currently on a Closed Beta Test in limited regions only (Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico) that runs from 18:00:00 on December 6, 2023 (PST) to 18:00:00 on December 18, 2023 (PST).\r\nThis arcade-style open-world racing game aims to captivate players with its iconic Need for Speed elements, including high-speed races, police pursuits, and a ‘rising to the challenge’ storyline. The game features AAA-level graphics, simplified touch controls, and a unique open-world environment called Heat Bay, where players can engage in various challenges and activities.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe graphics are as good as it can get for a mobile game, with AAA levels of fidelity I would expect from a big franchise such as Need for Speed. The detailing of car models and environments is commendable, and the game introduces minor destructible environments such as trees, fences, and street litter which all in all adds a bit to the immersion, especially in this open-world setting. Need for Speed Mobile also adapts and continues the trend set by Need for Speed Unbound, with stylized artistic Neon-Anime visual effects emanating from the cars to accentuate the action.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nNeed for Speed Mobile is a racing game through and through, but more adapted to the mobile experience. The controls are much more simplified for a touch control scheme: automated acceleration with a dedicated button for drifting, and of course, it won’t be a proper Need for Speed without that patented Nitro Boost mechanics. The gameplay showcases solid arcade racing mechanics with engaging races and challenges throughout the map.\r\n## 🌍Open-World Free Roam\r\nHeat Bay serves as a full-fledged open-world environment, providing players with freedom to explore, undertake challenges, and participate in various activities. This open-world feature distinguishes Need for Speed Mobile from other racing games, offering a dynamic and expansive backdrop for races and pursuits.\r\n## 🏁🚔Ranked Races and Police Chases\r\nThe game is centered on two key modes; Ranked Races where you race in real-time against other players and Police Pursuit where you can play as a Racer trying to attract “heat” for fun or a Police Car trying to capture a racer. This mode comes across as a bit too futuristic for my tastes, with EMP blast abilities, shields, and power-ups, but it’s nonetheless an interesting aspect that adds more to the game than just pure racing. There are also side mission elements such as Odd Jobs, Training modes; plus Track, Jump, and Speed Challenges which can keep players busy with its variety of engaging activities.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression is centered on the player going through the story missions and unlocking the game modes one by one, winning race after race, acquiring more cars, and upgrading them to perform better. The progression is reinforced by the opportunity to acquire better cars through gacha mechanics, adding a layer of excitement and customization to the journey.\r\n## 🔧Customization\r\nCustomization remains a key aspect of the game, beginning with the creation of your custom character and extending to extensive car customization, including color, performance tuning, and cosmetics. The game offers a wide range of options such as hubs, tires, paint, and wraps, enabling players to choose their favorite colors or create custom designs to make their cars stand out on the race tracks. Different currencies are available for accumulation, providing the means to enhance and personalize your cars.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game's performance on my Snapdragon 888 device is relatively decent, which is well above the minimum requirements (Snapdragon 710, Helio G70, Kirin 810, Exynos 9610). I was able to play at a high FPS setting, which likely translates to 60FPS, although it is not entirely free of slowdowns.\r\nI experienced FPS drops, especially during open-world segments, and the multiplayer experience is not as smooth yet, featuring noticeable rubber banding and lag, particularly when encountering other players in races. In terms of stability, I have encountered no crashes so far, nor have I encountered major game-breaking bugs. However, it's essential to note that this review is based on the Dec 2023 'CBT2' and may not accurately reflect the quality of the finished product. There are rumors that the game will release on China this January, but don’t quote me on that.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWith a diverse range of activities, customization options, and engaging progression, Need for Speed Mobile is set to provide an immersive and enjoyable experience for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike, offering a compelling combination of engaging arcade racing gameplay, impressive AAA-level graphics, and a well-designed open-world environment.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6637078) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Black Myth: Wukong\r\n8.5\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nIt has been a very busy day today with The Game Awards, with well deserved awardees like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Alan Wake 2, thrilling announcements, and exclusive reveals at The Game Awards. There is one particular exciting piece of news has caught my interest among all of them, and it’s Black Myth: Wukong, the highly anticipated action RPG deeply rooted in Chinese mythology. It has graced us with a mesmerizing new “Official Release Date Trailer” with a confirmed release date of August 20, 2024. The game is set to launch on the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC platforms.\r\nOriginally teased in 2020, Black Myth: Wukong has been generating a lot of hype ever since, with fans patiently waiting for more news. It aligns itself with other games in the market that share similar themes, such as Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Wild Hearts, both of which games that have already released.\r\nThe latest trailer not only provides a glimpse into the stunning visuals and gameplay but also offers an insight into the rich narrative inspired by the classic Chinese literary masterpiece, Journey to the West.\r\nThe trailer showcased numerous new characters and figures, many of which have an unnerving and peculiar appearance. From bizarre to haunting, mysterious to unsettling, these characters add an extra layer of mystery and intrigue to the Black Myth: Wukong universe, promising players an experience that goes beyond the ordinary.\r\nIt also showcased what seemed to be a diverse range of boss encounters featuring various types of enemies—be they on land, in the sea, or in the air, from regular-sized beasts to gigantic creatures. Furthermore, the game appears more polished than ever with smooth looking cinematics and animations.\r\nWhile most of the new trailer is cinematic, it effectively sets the tone of the game, which is surprisingly seems to be heavy on the narrative side rather than being purely gameplay-oriented. This approach is fitting as the game is based on 'Journey to the West,' one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.\r\nAs the Destined One, players will face a diverse cast of adversaries drawn. Each foe brings unique strengths to the table, ensuring that every encounter is a test of skill and strategy. Epic battles await, and surrender is not an option for the brave and determined.\r\nThe game features a dynamic combat ARPG system, incorporating martial arts and weapon-based combat.

    "body": "Star Survivor\r\n8.3\r\nSpace\r\nAction\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nStar Survivor, initially released in Early Access on PC earlier this year, has now made its way to mobile phones this December. The game is a top-down space shooter and seems to be a mash up of multiple genres. It features a Space Shooter premise, Vampire Survivor gameplay, Deck building mechanics, and Rogue-lite progression that all results into a unique experience that has translated well into mobile.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Diverse gameplay elements\r\n- Chaotic engaging combat\r\n- Strategic deckbuilding elements\r\n- Dynamic rogue-lite progression\r\n## Cons\r\n- Ultra repetitive battle soundtrack\r\n- Limited narrative experience\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nStar Survivor lacks a traditional narrative, offering just a straightforward and rather basic premise of piloting a ship to combat space aliens and occasionally blow up some asteroids for credits. There is a campaign, but it’s not a story campaign as it instead follows a rogue-like structure, presenting players with randomized levels leading up to a final boss.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe game's visuals are characterized by a fusion of 2D top-down gameplay with simple 3D graphics. The graphics are colorful, flashy, and explosive, contributing to the chaotic atmosphere of surviving against space alien hordes. Despite some visual clutter that may impede vision during packed moments, the overall design is well-suited for the genre, delivering a fantastic arcade experience.\r\nThe soundtrack features an upbeat EDM style of music, although there seems to be only one battle track throughout the entire game, which can easily get repetitive. I would highly recommend listening to an external playlist instead. The sound bites of some weapons sound similar to retro titles like Space Invaders or Galaga,  which gives me a bit of a mild nostalgia when playing.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nStar Survivor offers a fantastic arcade experience that combines elements of Space Invaders, Vampire Survivors, and the usual Deck Building and Rogue-lite game experience. Easy to learn but challenging to master, the game presents a variety of ships and weapons, each offering unique playstyles and weapon/upgrade synergies. Players can engage in three different modes: Campaign, Challenge, and Endless, providing a mix of random missions, strategic deck crafting, and continuous survival against an endless swarm of enemies.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe controls are pretty simple, left touch to move the ship, and a right button to activate a speed boost. You don’t have to worry about attacks as the ship auto-fires, but you have to orient the ship properly as some weapons have a limited cone of range to attack. Some weapons don’t have this limitation but are generally weaker in damage, so you’d have to choose whether to prioritize one or the other.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat in Star Survivor is dynamic and engaging, allowing players to create various weapon and equipment combinations. The game introduces deckbuilding strategy, enabling players to mix different weapon upgrades in quadrants for directional, random, and auto-targeting weapons. The choice of ships, weapons, and upgrades leads to diverse and overpowered builds, even resulting in “Combos” — combining two upgrades into one — making each run unique. The combat system encourages experimentation and strategy, adding depth to the gameplay.\r\nI also loved how they visualized the HP of the enemy aliens by use of color codings without resorting to health bars. As you damage enemies, they become cooler in color; If they start orange, they will slowly become blue, which will mean it’s at low HP. It’s a subtle but very powerful element that makes a lot of difference in how the combat flows.\r\nThe player ship mostly takes damage only when colliding with asteroids or enemy ships, so you’d just have to physically evade these to avoid damage. You don’t have to endlessly avoid barrages missiles and lasers in assortment of patterns to survive. This isn’t that type of game.\r\n## ⏫Rogue-lite Progression\r\nAside from the rogue-lite The progression in Star Survivor revolves around upgrading the ship through a random equipment choice by pick-up XP from fallen enemies. You also get to craft your own deck of equipment and power-up card. Players face an endless swarm of alien drones, with each kill providing resources for vessel upgrades, new ship unlocks, or stacking the odds in their favor.\r\nThe Challenge Mode introduces another layer of deckbuilding twist, allowing players to unlock and upgrade cards for strategic builds. In Campaign mode, players choose their path wisely, conquering each sector to face the Endless Queens in an epic space war.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nStar Survivor performed relatively well on my Snapdragon 888 device, with acceptable performance and great battery life. No crashes or massive slowdowns, and the controls are very responsive. I have no complaints about the game in the technical department.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nStar Survivor has proven to be an enjoyable gaming experience, successfully blending space shooter mechanics with deckbuilding strategy. The game's pacing strikes a balance between chaotic action and engaging progression, providing a satisfying gameplay loop. I highly recommend it hands down especially if you love space shooters, deckbuilders, and rogue-lite gameplay.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6645389) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora takes players on an immersive journey into the world of Pandora, expanding upon the lore established in James Cameron's epic cinematic universe. As a first-person action-adventure game, it combines the lush yet dangerous environments of Avatar with the open-world design reminiscent of Ubisoft's Far Cry series. Ubisoft is really the perfect company to make Avatar video games  with their experience on Far Cry.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nReleased for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S, the game introduces a unique blend of survival crafting RPG elements, first person combat, open-world gameplay, and coop multiplayer.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Does justice to the Avatar lore and IP\r\n- An immersive cinematic experience\r\n- Emphasis on exploration; with detailed plant and animal life\r\n- Lots of elements that blend well together (survival, crafting, exploration, FPS, RPG)\r\n- Varied progression system with different skills, abilities, and gear upgrades## Cons\r\n- Unessential narrative\r\n- Performance issues across all platforms\r\n- Slow start\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet in the year 2146, Frontiers of Pandora follows the story of a Na'vi orphan raised by the Resources Development Administration (RDA) as part of The Ambassador Program. Players awaken years later, discovering their origins and joining the Resistance against the RDA's exploitation of Pandora. Because your Na’vi were raised by humans instead, this essentially resolves the plot conundrum of players having no idea about being a Na’vi but playing as one. The character instead learns the culture of his people alongside the player.\r\nThe narrative includes elements from the films but remains a standalone experience. It’s not a masterpiece of a narrative like the films and it doesn’t make the game hard to put down when you are playing it, but it’s a decent side/parallel story to the main films and for sure those who loved the lore of Avatar would appreciate a story that expands that carefully crafted lore of Avatar even more.\r\nGraphics and Art Style\r\nThe game's visuals showcase a stunning adaptation of Avatar's psychedelic vibrant color palette and sci-fi aesthetic. The environments, ranging from dense jungles to open plateaus, are all visually impressive. The audio contribute to the immersive experience, dynamically shifting between ambient sounds and intense combat music. It’s not as impressive as the CGI of even the 2009 film, but it’s pretty darn close for real-time graphics and a video game. There are minor visual issues here and there, such as upscaling artefacts and poor LOD models, but nothing bad really stands out.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThere is a simple parkour system that allows players to easily climb up cliffs, trees, and jump huge gaps, and it generally works well for the player and I would say even better than Assassin’s Creed’s parkour system that sometimes works against you. Here you have more freedom to move and you’re not lock to specific animations. All of these aspects mesh well together that coalescence into a good immersive Adventure Avatar game.\r\nDespite being FarCry in an Avatar skin, Frontiers of Pandora slightly deviates from Ubisoft's traditional open-world design by emphasizing exploration, even on the guided mode. Meaning no obnoxious quest markers and quest objectives that serve as guides only and not direct coordinates.\r\nThey treat the lore with respect as they actually took their time to introduce the different Flora and Fauna of Pandora, and you can even analyze these plants and animals and there will be a dedicated information page to each of them. This is like playing a much focused version of No Man’s Sky. The game really transports you to Pandora.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat in the game offers a mix of Na'vi and human weapons, providing a range of options to players. Strategic thinking and Stealth play becomes crucial, especially when facing multiple opponents or mech suits. The game successfully incorporates intense combat sequences, such as facing down multiple mech suits, creating memorable moments for players. The gunplay combat is serviceable and fun, but I wouldn’t be lying if I said it’s pretty mid for an FPS game, especially since you can’t even aim down sights.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression system involves resource hunting and gathering for materials like animal hides or rare plants to upgrade your weapons/gear, and leveling up via XP to assign points to a skill tree. You also unlock Na’vi special abilities like the double jump that adds another rewarding element to the progression, allowing players to traverse the diverse landscapes efficiently. However, the game does suffer from a snail paced storytelling during the start of the game, with lots of cutscenes, back and forth running, with no action in between.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWhile the game presents a visually striking world, technical issues have marred the experience for me. I played the Xbox version, and there’s frequent hitching, FPS drops, and blurry scaling all over the experience. I’ve read that the same goes for other platforms such as the PS5 or the PC version. The hope is that future patches will address these issues, but as of now, players without high-end PCs may find the game challenging to enjoy.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6651025) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Day Before\r\n5.7\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nTest\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nThe Day Before is a survival horror extraction shooter with multiplayer elements, it was initially hyped as a massive multiplayer experience, comparable to The Division or DayZ. However, it's off to a rocky Early Access start with numerous delays leading up to this Early Access release, trademark disputes, and major performance issues. The game's ambitious promises have not been met, leading to widespread disappointment among players.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 1/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game lacks a central story, though there are minor cutscenes and dialogues with NPCs that establish the game's core gameplay loops. You create your own character, and the premise begins with you being discovered unconscious amidst the zombie apocalypse by the well-off and surprisingly prosperous settlement known as Woodbury. They decide to take you in and register you as a new resident and then your personal story begins.\r\n## ☝️First Impressions\r\nAfter having bottom-level expectations going into the game, the introduction sequence is surprisingly decent, evoking vibes reminiscent of The Division with a touch of GTA V. I found myself saying, \"It's not that bad.\" The tour around the settlement is quite pleasant, with a cozy atmosphere, showcasing the settlement's size, friendly NPC inhabitants, and other players running around in a shared instance setting. While the voice acting is passable, the facial animations are virtually nonexistent and seem to have been made without much effort. As I play a bit more, it becomes apparent that the introduction was the absolute peak of the game.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nWhat was initially showcased in the debut trailer as a beautifully detailed open world has given way to embarrassing, low-poly textures and plain character models. While it still looks somewhat passable, the graphical downgrade from the flashy trailer is disappointing, and the overall visual experience falls short of the promised standard. Honestly, it looks just on par or even worse the Grand Theft Auto V, a game that was released 10 years ago, and that game runs effortlessly now in today’s modern hardware.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe Day Before was marketed as an open-world MMO with survival elements, but the reality is far from it. The game leans more towards being an online extraction shooter with limited features, and they probably switched it up in development when they realized they can’t pull off the open-world MMO element with the resources that they have, or it may have been the plan all along.\r\nPlayers have a certain hub:  the Woodbury settlement in which you can buy stuff like meds, gear, and weapons; a storage to safekeep your items, because dying while outside means losing all your equiped gear. It’s not fully open-world, you just decide to go out into the city at any time and the game will load you into a random entry point. You can take on missions from NPCs so you’d have some sense of direction while looting but the experience is largely uninspired. You can go to an extraction point to go back to Woodbury. That's basically it. Woodbury, Loot the city, extract. Rinse and repeat until you can buy more gear, house decorations, or vehicles.\r\nThe city is big enough —- I would hand it to them — but it’s not enough of an experience. Looting is half-baked and you don’t even know which containers or items are lootable and which aren’t. Loot is sparse, and even the zombies are almost non-existent. I roamed around the city for a while, and only saw three zombies; seriously they could have restored society back since zombies are almost gone.\r\nPlaying it more, there are indeed quite a few hot spots of zombies here and there that gave me some challenge, and just when I was starting to get some semblance of enjoyment, the game crashed. What’s worse? When I reloaded back, all my items are gone, my character is completely stripped for no reason.\r\nIf you are old enough to have been part of the early Arma 2 DayZ mod days, this is basically the same experience but worse considering this is already 10 years later; buggy, clunky, and barely works. The DayZ mod even did many things better than this Early Access game.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat in The Day Before is as basic shooter as it is, with enemy AI also being overly simplistic. If you’re quite adept at Unreal Engine, you’ll probably come up with a better combat system in a day, using off-the-shelf animations and script packges. There is no melee system, so you can’t defend yourself once you run out of bullets, and the hits and reactions from zombies are noticeably delayed.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe main gameplay loop of the game is to go into the city, loot and complete some missions, and then extract back to get more money. Anytime you die in the city, you lose all the gear you bring, so it’s a matter of balancing resources and being careful in how you roam outside. There are three character classes to choose from when creating a character, some basic weapon customization, but with minimal differences that it’s almost a placeholder feature at this point.\r\nThere is also a personal land plot that you can develop, wherein you can build a tent, cabin, place furnitures around, and even buy vehicles… ala GTA V. but the prices are so absurd that it’s almost impossible to buy these without intense grinding, which defeats the purpose of testing the game in Early Access, when things are locked to pointless impossible grinding.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game suffers from massive stutter issues, crashes, and bugs. Falling through the floor, losing items, renegade UI elements, and server de-syncs are commonly experienced here. Usually Early Access games gets a pass from these kind of issues, but in The Day Before its actually that bad. It’s probably one of the worst Early Access games ever released. Additionally, Controller support is very partially implemented, and not usable at the moment.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nNow, as highly anticipated as this game was, it has also been universally disliked even before its release. The early and ongoing dislike largely arises from the game's false advertising practices and suspicious delays; compounded by its poor, incomplete, and buggy state at the moment. However, beneath all this mediocrity lies a decent zombie survival game concept waiting to happen. It’s a shame that this wasn’t the same game that was shown during the E3 reveal, and it probably never will be. I do hope some other publisher/developer decides to pick up the concept and craft an actually great game from it.\r\nIf it wasn’t in Early Access, it can actually go toe-to-toe with Walking Dead: Destinies for the Worst Game Of The Year award (WGOTY). Is it no coincidence that they're both games about zombies? You be the judge. At least Walking Dead has an intriguing narrative.\r\nOverall, my initial experience has been absolute far from stellar. The Steam page is flooded with negative reviews, and unfortunately, I have to join the chorus. I do not recommend this game, and I would advise you to simply forget about it if you're even the slightest bit interested.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6651039) Originally posted on TapTap.",

I tested the Demo recently — and with the limited gameplay I experienced, I can say there is indeed potential in this game, if they can get the pacing and the  mechanics right upon release.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\nPocket Playfest: An Indie Celebration 2023 Winter Edition\r\nIn a recent hands-on exclusive experience this past weekend, I had the privilege of testing a handful of titles on TapTap's experimental cloud gaming service, setting the stage for this 16-day event where indie game developers show-off their creations exclusively on the TapTap mobile platform — fully playable PC games without the need for an actual PC, Android/iOS version, or the need to download the games and install them.  Granted, you’d need to have a reliable internet service to be able to stream these games, and preferably are located in US and Canada for consistent play and latency, at least for now.\r\n## 🔗Join the Playfest >>\r\n## 📅 Schedule\r\nPlayfest Winners & Player Rewards Announcement: January 8, 12 AM PT.\r\nFor my personal cloud gaming experience in this specific, please see further below in the review.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe visuals of Core Devourer looks really close to Risk of Rain 2. The game utilizes a low-poly style 3D environment with a stylized and somewhat cel-shaded aesthetic. In fact, if I had been shown this without knowing the title, I would have thought its a new Risk of Rain game. There is something relaxing for me in this type of art style, and I like it.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nCore Devourer is set to take players in an exhilarating sci-fi roguelite experience where the primary objective is to confront colossal hordes of droids, absorb their cores, and ascend as the most potent cybernetic entity on the planet.\r\nThe game features procedurally generated maps, with randomized power-up choices gained from killing enemies and gathering EXP. These power-ups include, but are not limited to, spawning turrets and drones or adding elemental damage to your guns, such as ice, electricity, and fire. I can already imagine some builds emerging from this, judging from my early experience with the various power-ups.\r\nThe weapon system is touted to be vast, featuring a multitude of weapons called Cores with unique powers and effects. As you progress, unlocking these weapons will become integral to refining your combat strategy. Augmentations serves as the skill-tree upgrade system. Crafting powerful gear and experimenting with augmentations and components will allow players to “create game-breaking builds”, yes, breaking the game is encouraged. Most of the Augmentation and Components system as still locked for the Demo, so I wasn’t not able to delve that much into these aspects.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe game is a twin-stick arena shooter where you clear the open map of all robots and bosses. There are varying degrees of automation with the aiming, you can play as a twin-stick shooter and aim manually, let the game auto-aim the closest enemy, or let it auto-fire at enemies. However when using autofire, your movement takes a hit, as firing slow down movement and you cannot control when to stop firing to gain that extra speed. You CAN cycle through the different modes to effective turn on and off auto-fire, but I would have preferred a dedicated toggle button for it.\r\nAdditional, you still can’t play it ala-Vampire Survivors, because you still need to activate your secondary and dash abilities. Movement alone is not enough, an option to at least automate the secondary ability would have been a good alternative.\r\nThe health system is unforviging, as it only gives you three lives. No health points. As soon as the enemy or a projectile touches you, you lose one HP. and I could not find any mechanics that helped with this nor had my lives restored during runs.\r\nOverall, the combat is challenging, fun, and encourages experimentation. However, there are some frustrations during the early game experience. The game starts quite slow in the first 5-10 minutes of runs, with the most basic starting enemies already requiring multiple hits to bring down, and the character moving annoyingly slow. As soon as you get more power-ups, only then your power can finally spike enough to be able to enjoy it. This is unlike other games like Vampire Survivors where the starting enemies only take a single hit to kill, allowing a smoother run progression.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nCore Devourer has the promise of delivering an engaging roguelite adventure with a distinctive visual style and innovative gameplay mechanics, taking many best parts of both Risk of Rain 2 and Vampire Survivors. However, the success of the game upon release will depend on the developers fine-tuning certain aspects, particularly the pacing and balancing of early-game challenges. Nevertheless, it’s a game worth looking into if you happen to love its obvious inspirations.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise. The quality is seriously impressive - we're talking sharp HD resolution, not like your typical streamed game. Looks and feels native and doesn’t feel like its streamed. The performance is also smooth (60FPS), with good frame timing (by visual observation only, as there was no tool to monitor this). There’s currently no way to play at a native 16:9 with black bars, as the screen is stretched out to the phone’s screen.\r\n## 📶Cloud Latency\r\nIn my experience, my latency during the test phase was around 200ms --- only because the servers are currently located in United States for now and I'm connecting from asia. Even then, It’s still a bit playable, especially for games that are not latency sensitive like point and click games or those with simple controls. Having said that, it’s just a matter of server location and having lots of servers. It’s understandable since this is just a testing phase with limited servers. If a datacenter is nearby, I am positive that I’ll have a smooth and fluid experience, same with those living in the US or Canada. It works like a charm on 5GHz wifi, but the experience took a hit on 2.4GHz, so won’t recommend that.\r\n## 🕹Cloud Touch Controls\r\nNow, onto the user interface. I'm a fan of how each game has its own custom on-screen buttons, tailored to the specific control scheme. It works like a charm for simpler games, but things get a bit tricky with more complex ones.\r\n## 🔃Cloud Accessibility\r\nAccessing the service is a breeze - the Instant Play integration is right there on the game page, next to Download/Steam/Play buttons.  Loading times are impressively fast, and I love that I can minimize the TapTap app and return to the game still streaming. Progress is not yet saved between streaming sessions, so it’s clearly just for testing purposes. Overall, it's been an interesting experience, and while there are some kinks, the potential here is exciting. Definitely surpassed my expectations.\r\n## 🌩Specific Cloud Game Experience\r\nCore Devourer is semi playable on cloud gaming, fully playable with the auto-aim mode but becomes unplayable in manual aim mode since there’s no way to aim using the given touch controls. The game is highly latency-dependent since you’d have to evade the swarm of enemies in real time, with an unforgiving health mechanic that only gives you three lives that get consumed at the slightest touch.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654237) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Clash Mini\r\n8.5\r\nStrategy\r\nBoard\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nClash Mini is Supercell’s take on the strategic mind crunching auto-chess experience. Set in a Clash of Clash universe, prepare to go to war in dynamic battlefields where miniature armies clash for supremacy, the game offers a unique blend of strategic depth, iconic Clash of Clans characters, and fast-paced gameplay.\r\nAs a commander, players collect, summon, and upgrade an army of Minis, engaging in 1v1 battles or diving into the chaotic Rumble mode against seven other players. The game recently released its patch 2.0 that introduces a myriad of new features, with Supercell touting it as the game's most significant update to date.\r\nFor newcomers like me, I have no idea about many of the inner workings of the new patch, so I will be describing the game at face value, without no prior knowledge or baggage from previous versions, except for the recent patch notes.\r\nThe game is currently still on a “soft-launch” with availability in limited countries only (Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong (China), Iceland, ,Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sweden, The Philippines, The United Kingdom)\r\n## Pros\r\n- Charming visuals taken from the Clash of Clans universe\r\n- Strategic auto-chess gameplay with some cool twists\r\n- New update revamps the game with many new features\r\n- Smooth performance and blazing fast loading times## Cons\r\n-Temporarily removes some game modes with the new patch\r\n-Minor pay-to-win elements that will only be pronounced in higher rank levels of play\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nProbably a lot of people now already knows about the Clash of Clans universe, and this game builds upon this gaming verse and maintains the same thematic elements in the art style and visuals if only a little more vibrant. It still features the whimsical character designs we all know but in miniature form. The game’s visuals was actually updated with the 2.0 patch and made the graphics more modernized, HD, and vibrant looking, very timely if you are a newcomer or a returning player.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nAt its core, Clash Mini revolves around summoning and strategically placing Minis to win its auto-chess like battles. You build your deck of minis beforehand, collecting and upgrading them through various means like grinding or spending money in the store.\r\nThe game's accessibility makes it easy for players to grasp the basics quickly, but the strategic depth ensures a challenging learning curve. Players can choose either 1v1 battles and the Rumble mode against multiple opponents caters to both casual and competitive players.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nPlayers strategically place their Minis on an 8x5 board, predict their opponent's moves, and watch the miniature mayhem unfold. The real-time battles are under five minutes each, so the matches are quick and bite-sized. The minis actually move across the blocks one by one like in a chess match, instead of moving freely like in other auto-chess games. Players can upgrade Minis during battle by summoning duplicates, and activate stronger abilities to turn the tide. Some matches have special tiles them, like a launchpad to instantly bring a unit to the far side of the map, which makes matches more dynamic and interesting, with regards to how players usually use melee and ranged units.\r\nThe gameplay is very strategic; at first, I had no idea what to do and just randomly placed units as I saw fit. But then as I played more and more matches, I learned more and started to instinctively knew what to do with what units, and it become more and more fun and intense as I played; especially in close matches where you win with just one unit and 1 hit left in its HP. There is some luck involved still and a bit of pay-to-win, but for the lower ranks and those just looking to enjoy a decent auto-chess, the game is excellent.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression system in Clash Mini is designed to provide players with a rewarding journey as they navigate through the game. Players earn rewards through various in-game activities, such as completing quests, winning battles, and participating in events. These rewards include new Minis, skins, and other cosmetic items. As players accumulate victories, they progress through different ranks, such as from Silver to Gold. The typical live service hallmarks are present, such as a Battle Pass called Mini Pass and a Gacha system called Toy Machine to get some pretty cool skins.\r\n## 📲Patch 2.0 Summary\r\nSummarizing the patch notes, Clash Mini 2.0 adds 13 new Minis, including the formidable Battle Machine hero. The game now features Classes, categorizing units and activating special effects when using 2 or 4 units from the same class in a battle.\r\nRumble becomes a 4-player draft, and cosmetic progression takes center stage with emotes, avatars, and battle highlights. Skin Series and boards are introduced alongside a departure from stat level ups, making progression purely cosmetic.\r\nThe Hero Promotions system allows unlocking strategic choices during battles, and heroes can be repositioned once per game. The update also includes a visual overhaul, a Toy Machine (Gacha) for special units and skins, and the temporary removal of puzzles and raids in favor of a Battle Log. The Mini Pass (Battle Pass) undergoes simplification, relying on quests for steady progress\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nOverall, the game performed very smoothly on my Snapdragon 888 device, without any crashes or performance drops. The game actually loaded very fast as if I was playing on PS5. Even the matches load up very fast and queues up very quickly, as of this writing, probably due to the influx of new players coinciding with the new patch. Battery life is also great, you can play for hours on end without even depleting your phone’s battery. If playing for quick five minute bursts, battery use is negligible.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nClash Mini is Supercell’s another step into dominating every popular genre in the mobile market. Now, it is trying to break into the auto-chess land with its charming visuals, strategic depth, and accessible gameplay, and it will probably succeed. Clash Mini offers an excellent gaming experience for Auto-chess lovers and Clash of Clans fans alike.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654292) Originally posted on TapTap.",

As a Meta-Human, players harness the power of Stardust to survive, fight, build, and explore in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction.\r\nOnce HumanGlobal\r\n8.1\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nAction\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nOnce Human is an upcoming fascinating amalgamation of multiple video game themes; Death Stranding, Control, and Alan Wake, blending post-apocalyptic and sci-fi elements into a genre that I somewhat found surprising and out-of-place, ---- an open-world sandbox. The game introduces players to a world ravaged by the Stardust, an alien entity infesting everything, turning them into monstrous forms. As a Meta-Human, players harness the power of Stardust to survive, fight, build, and explore in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe narrative kicks off with a mysterious experiment on the player's character, rescued by an unknown force in a post-apocalyptic world. The storyline is reminiscent of eldritch horrors and lab experiments gone wrong tropes, weaving a serious and cinematic tone into the gameplay, including eldtritch-like monsters like floating octopus like beings and the huge spider-like creatures. The overarching goal is to unravel the truth behind Stardust, its origin, and its intentions. The ravaged world is divided into factions, some friendly, others hostile, offering a dynamic narrative where choices shape the journey.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nVisually, Once Human looks a like a normal modern game with detailed third person shooter graphics, but still rough around the edges. The starting cutscenes display some impressive cinematic prowess but with heavy stuttering. The art style contributes to the eerie atmosphere, really embracing the eldritch horror theme. The first part of the game looks very much taken from Control, with its red light infested hallways, floating objects, horror elements, and it is by far a good start.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nAfter the intro though, the game’s appeal slightly dials down because it suddenly becomes a typical open-world survival game; roam around the open map, gather wood, stones, and resources; and try to build bigger stuff. This is something you’ve heard before many times already.  While the game maintains the same elements thematically, the switch in gameplay style is awkwardly noticeable, it went from a full blown Control/Alan Wake experience to more of a survival crafting one, like Ark Survival or Rust. The vibe of the world is very much like Death Stranding; the expansive world is bleak and ravaged, but there are still lots of trees and grass and it’s still beautiful.\r\nAside from its open-world survival aspect, Once Human blends elements of third-person shooting, stealthy melee combat, puzzle-solving, and a rich cinematic narrative as the backdrop. The character customization at the start is robust, offering detailed options akin to a legit RPG game. Puzzles, hidden treasures, and platforming challenges and missions are scattered throughout the game, adding more stuff to do aside from improving your character, crafting new gear, and building your settlement.\r\nAside from the \"Journey\" tutorial to teach the basics to the player, you also have the story missions running in parallel with the tutorial missions to compel the players. However, it's still in a very obvious development state, as there are still lots of unvoiced dialogue and bugs with the game's dialogue system.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe combat — gunplay wise — is actually fluid and responsive in its current state, featuring a variety of options, from stealth melee kills to sniping and tactical weapon usage. Players can also telekinetically pick up a limited number of \"weird\" objects that can be used as weapons: a briefcase that spews money or a red spotlight that directly kills enemies Alan-Wake style. I played on the America server, so a big of lag was expected, but it was still surprisingly playable.\r\nThe diversity of enemies, including corrupted wildlife and human “zombies”, keeps encounters engaging. Boss fights litter the zones with fun and challenging cooperative elements, although they are way harder than the normal mobs and can catch you off guard.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression system is well-structured, with a crafting and gathering skill tree called Memetics. As said earlier, the journey chapters act as an additional tutorial, guiding players through features and rewarding experience, currency, and materials. The player's territory, created with a Territory Core, serves as a customizable base and a moveable respawn point. Crafting, gathering, cooking, and resource management contribute to the survival aspect, with elements like Sanity, Hunger, and Thirst affecting gameplay.\r\nI also loved that they implemented a “Move territory” feature, so you’re not really stuck to one place with your settlement, and you don’t have to start over again if you’ve found a better place to settle. Just move your territory, and bam — Everything is transported. I just hope they don’t implement paywalls with this feature, or if they do, make it affordable or reasonably grindable.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nDuring the closed beta, I experienced significant FPS and performance issues across the entirety of the experience. There are some places where it would perform smoothly like a polished game, but more often than not the performance is not yet stable and optimized. The animations, movement, and interacts with world objects are still clunky.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nOnce Human stands as a promising and refreshing venture into the open-world survival genre with its survival horror themes, clearly surpassing the recent failures of The Day Before, even in its limited closed beta state. What's great is that it's free to test, with no paid Early Access period (for now), and you can already see the game's potential for yourself at no cost. There's already working, enjoyable proof of a game that serves as a good foundation for what’s to come. My only wish is that lean more towardsthe survival horror route (Control, Alan Wake) and that it doesn’t go a full-on survival crafting experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654395) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Since my previous review during the open beta, THE FINALS has officially launched on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, marking its official entry into the highly competitive market of team-based FPS games, announced during The Game Awards show.",

    "body": "THE FINALS\r\n9.2\r\nFast-paced\r\nAction\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nSince my previous review during the open beta, THE FINALS has officially launched on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, marking its official entry into the highly competitive market of team-based FPS games, announced during The Game Awards show.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Stunning visuals and lighting effects\r\n- Dynamic high octane FPS gameplay\r\n- Best in class destructible environments and physics\r\n- Diverse game modes and map variants\r\n- Smooth performance## Cons\r\n- No text chat for better communication\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nTHE FINALS features a captivating dystopian-themed setting, reminiscent of \"The Hunger Games\" and the adrenaline-fueled nature of battle royale games like Apex Legends. The game adopts an immersive virtual reality TV show premise, complete with in-game commentary and an enthusiastic audible audience. The presentation is without a doubt top-notch, and only adds to the excitement of playing it.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay of THE FINALS is a solid refreshing team-based FPS experience, offering a unique blend of realism and arcade shooting elements. The game puts you on a team of 3, battling other teams of 3 across diverse game modes and map variants.\r\nThe movement maintains a sense of weight and strategy while allowing fast movement especially when using the Light class with has extra speed but low health. The introduction of jump pads, ziplines, and zero fall damage also adds a lot of mobility to the players. The class-based system features distinct abilities and gadgets for each class, and you’ll pretty much need to have one or two of each class in order to succeed.\r\nThe release brings forth a few notable changes, with a seemingly subtle but divisive shift in movement speed, which has become a point of criticism in the community. Personally, I didn't find this adjustment noticeable in my gameplay experience, but it's worth noting for those who are sensitive to such nuances. The developers have acknowledged that they didn’t implement such changes in movement speed numbers, and the culprit is probably in the animation and server changes that they have tweaked leading up to the release.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat is absolutely explosive and high-octane, with a notable high Time to Kill (TTK) that distinguishes it from other shooters. I’ll almost always run out of magazine to kill one person, and this changes the entire gunplay to more of a strategic one than a battle of quick reflexes and one-taps.\r\nThe abilities are well-integrated, adding strategic depth without overwhelming visual clutter. The game's standout feature continues to be its destructible physics system, thanks to former Battlefield developers. Destruction isn't just cosmetic; it's a tactical tool that can be leveraged for a strategic advantage.\r\n## 🎙 No Text Chat, only Voice.\r\nMy only gripe is the lack of text chat, as not everyone uses voice chat, and the ping system isn't a valid replacement for direct communication. Therefore, I highly recommend playing with a group of three friends to fully enjoy the team-based matchups. While playing solo is still viable and winnable, you'd have to rely on non-verbal communication with your teammates if they don't have voice chat enabled, and you’d have significant strategic disadvantage against players who use it.\r\n## 💥Destructible Physics\r\nThe destruction system is unparalleled compared to other games — even Battlefield itself — allowing players to use the environment strategically. Walls, floors, and pillars can be destroyed, offering a level of depth rarely seen in modern shooters. The physics-based destruction requires players to target critical points, adding a satisfying layer of strategy to the gameplay. Nothing is exempted in this destruction, even Objective elements such as Vaults or Cash-Out Stations will fall out the floor and get tossed around along with the destruction.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nTHE FINALS features three main game modes – Quick Cash, Bank It, and the lengthy Tournament Mode. Each mode offers a distinct experience, catering to both casual and competitive players. The maps, including Skyway Stadium, Monaco, Las Vegas, and Seoul, feature multiple variants that change one part of it or another. Some variants will have sections under construction, some will have moving objectives, some will completely change the elevation of some parts. To add to that, the time of day changes so it can be night time in one match, day time in another.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nProgression comes in the form of weapon and gear unlocks, currency to purchase more, and a Battle Pass System for those who’d want to turn this from a Free-to-Play experience to a paid one with premium cosmetics. No pay to win schemes so it’s all good for me.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI have no complaints about the performance, aside from the initially long launching times attributed to the anti-cheat system. The actual in-game performance is very smooth, featuring support for GPU technologies such as NVIDIA Reflex and DLSS. Even on consoles, the developers performed some kind of magic to optimize it, achieving a smooth 60FPS experience on the Series S.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI previously said this is “The most promising, refreshing, upcoming shooter that I’ve played all year”, and that stands true, just remove the “upcoming”. It hits all the spots of what makes a game fun for me: Battlefield-style destruction, team-based gameplay, a focus on objectives instead of frags, and some awesome presentation to glue it all together. If you’re looking to play a new competitive FPS game to end the year with a bang, then undoubtedly you should play THE FINALS\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654306) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Little Nightmares\r\n9.3\r\nHorror\r\nAdventure\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nYou’ve probably seen gameplay clips of charmingly eerie and interestingly cute game called Little Nightmares all over social media before, I know I did. Little Nightmares is a 3D puzzle-platformer that plunges players into a surreal and atmospheric world.\r\nDeveloped by Tarsier Studios and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, it was originally released last 2017 for PC and Consoles. While we got a mobile spin-off in the form of Very Little Nightmares last 2019 (in which I also reviewed), it was really not the same 3D experience it’s big little brother had. Finally, we now have an official mobile port for the actual Little Nightmares and it’s more or less captures the same experience, just translated to touch controls.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Subtle, beautiful, narrative experience\r\n- Dark, foreboding environments and haunting character designs\r\n- A tense and varied gameplay experience\r\n- Well-designed puzzles and levels\r\n- Accessible control options## Cons\r\n- Translation to touch controls made some platformer segments a little bit harder\r\n- Long Loading Times\r\n- Unforgiving checkpoint system\r\n- Performance optimization and stutters\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nLittle Nightmares is a narrative-driven experience that relies on atmosphere and tension, the game's subtle yet compelling narrative unfolds without any sort of dialogue or narration, allowing players to interpret the story's darker undertones through its gameplay and visual narrative.\r\nYou control Six, a small, raincoat-clad child trapped in a nightmarish vessel known as The Maw. The premise revolves around Six's desperate attempt to escape this grim place, battling grotesque and monstrous figures along the way. The minimalistic storytelling encourages players to piece together the narrative through environmental cues and the harrowing and disturbing experiences Six endures.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nLittle Nightmares features a simplistic 3D visuals that will give you some 3D animated film vibes. The game presents a macabre beauty with its dark, foreboding environments and haunting character designs. The use of lighting and shadows adds depth to the atmosphere, creating a visually stunning and immersive experience. Although there are some downgrades visually, especially in the graphical effects and model fidelity, The mobile version maintains this art style and visual direction. The sound design further enhances the artistic elements of the game, with an evocative soundtrack and chilling ambient noises that intensify the atmospheric tension.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nLittle Nightmares combines 3D platforming, puzzle-solving, and stealth elements to deliver a tense and varied gameplay experience. The controls are simple enough to be translated into touch controls without much complexity; only having a move, jump, crouch, interact, and light buttons for the most part. There is also an immersive mode that replaces most of the controls with gestures, ensuring accessibility without sacrificing depth.\r\nFor the most part, it allows players to navigate Six through treacherous environments with relative ease. However, if you're accustomed to physical stick controls, particularly if you've played the game before, you may notice that it's slightly harder to accurately control Six. This is especially evident during platforming segments that involve narrow passageways or avoiding noise-making objects.\r\n## 🥷Stealth\r\nStealth plays a crucial role in Little Nightmares, as Six is often vulnerable and outnumbered by the menacing towering creatures that inhabit The Maw. The game successfully creates a palpable sense of tension as players skulk through the shadows, avoiding detection and devising strategies to outsmart their pursuers. The stealth mechanics are well-implemented, providing a satisfying blend of fear and empowerment as players navigate the perilous world.\r\nMy only gripe is that the fixed camera views will sometimes be a detriment to the player, not allowing you to see far off creatures while they on the other hand can detect you quite for afar. You’ll find yourself suddenly spotted by these creatures without even knowing it.\r\n## 🧩Puzzles\r\nThe puzzle design in Little Nightmares is simple but logical and effectively. It is seamlessly integrated into the narrative and environments. The puzzles are intuitive yet clever, requiring players to observe their surroundings, analyze patterns, and use their problem-solving skills. While the game is linear, the approaches to solutions are not always obvious to the player and video gamified, sometimes there will be dead-ends or elements that will feel like it’s supposed to be part of the solution, but it’s not. It’s just adds to the overall believability of the world. The puzzles contribute to the overall sense of immersion, making the journey through The Maw feel like an authentic location a rather than mere linear path to walk through.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nEach chapter offers a new layer of intrigue and danger, new styles of location and enemies to consider. Little Nightmares avoids stagnation by introducing fresh gameplay mechanics and environmental hazards as players delve deeper into the twisted world. The progression feels natural, allowing the narrative to unfold organically while maintaining a sense of player agency. It doesn’t get too complex, and the mechanics to learn are just varied enough and are all too logical to forget. My only issue with the progression is that the checkpoint system is very unforgiving, more often than not reverting you back long stretches of platformer segments long before the difficult enemy encounter that you died in.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWhile Little Nightmares is a decent port that brings the beloved PC/Console game 1:1 to mobile devices, it’s not a perfect port.The game suffers from stutters and it’s a little bit unoptimized. With my Snapdragon 888 device (ROG Phone 5), I only was able to play the game comfortably at low graphics settings and 60FPS, with ocassional stutters. The loading times also take a long time to complete, even during checkpoint loads or do-overs. This, coupled with an unforgiving checkpoint system, compounds into a constant source of frustration.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nLittle Nightmares is a hauntingly beautiful puzzle-platformer that successfully transitions to the mobile platform, preserving the eerie charm and captivating narrative that made the original PC and console versions so popular. While it's not a perfect port and there are some optimizations that can be done, Little Nightmares remains a captivating adventure for mobile gamers seeking a dark and mysterious tale.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6660826) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Love and DeepspaceGlobal 5.8 Simulation Story Rich Download",
    "tags": "",

    "body": "Love and DeepspaceGlobal\r\n5.8\r\nSimulation\r\nStory Rich\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nLove and Deepspace is an upcoming atome game featuring high quality 3D graphics, dating sim elements, real-time ARPG combat, and gacha mechanics. Unlike many mobile games where its mostly tailored to male audiences with their attractive female characters, Love and Deepspace stands out for its unique focus on a female audience, offering an otome experience where players can embark on a space-faring tale filled with love, danger, and adventure.\r\nThe game is currently on a closed beta test (CBT) in limited regions including Indonesia and Philippines, from Dec 15 to 21. It doesn’t feature any in-app purchases, and progression will be wiped out.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10 (For the CBT)\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game's premise revolves around the Deepspace Tunnel — a spacetime anomaly that appeared in Linkon City 14 years ago and spawned creatures called Wanderers that started to invade Earth. This phenomenon also significantly advanced technology and kickstarted a boom in space exploration, with humanity spreading to the stars. Players take on the role of a newly recruited character created female Deepspace Hunter, tasked hunting the remaining Wanderers and investigating deeper into the anomaly.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Sound\r\nLove and Deepspace features ultra high fidelity graphics with almost CGI-like quality during narrative scenes, as well as in the gameplay. The art style is visually appealing — especially for female audience — and creates a seamless blend of futuristic aesthetics and character design that complements the sci-fi theme. In the character creator, the 3D rendering technology not only allows players to customize their avatars but also offers the unique feature of uploading a photo to create a 3D replica of themselves.\r\nThe soundtrack is also mesmerizing and feels something you would hear in an asian telenova series with its melodramatic and relaxing tones. It’s a very immersive game, particularly during story scenes that are presented in a first person view. It really feels like you’re in the character’s POV.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nLove and Deepspace introduces a mix of gameplay elements, including combat, personalization, and relationship building. The sci-fi world of Love and Deepspace unfolds through carefully crafted storylines and missions, allowing players to build connections with three romanceable male leads: Xavier, Rafayel, and Zayne. The narrative is enriched with immersive cutscenes, dialogue options, and real-time combat against the Wanderers.\r\nAs a Deepspace Hunter, players must utilize their \"Evol\" abilities to engage in combat, unleashing finishing moves, combo attacks, and strategic upgrades. This works similarly to any traditional mobile ARPG game, moving the character in real-time, dodging attacks, and using abilities in battle. You can bring one male companion with you, equipped as a “memory” with different tiers of quality and power level. Gear and cosmetics can also be customized.\r\nBeyond battling Wanderers, a huge part of the game about players deepening their relationships with the male leads through side stories, activities, and Dating, fostering a sense of connection and intimacy through high fidelity 3D-rendered interactions. It’s really immersive. You can hang out with any of the three male leads, text them (with pre-made dialogue options as text replies), or even visit a Photo Studio together to take pictures and pose together.\r\nThe first two hours of gameplay seems light on combat — I only played three combat missions for the first two hours — but it gradually picks up pace as the story unfolds. The CBT only allowed access to chapter 1 to 4 only, but access to chapter 3 and 4 are gated with a high level requirement that requires more EXP grinding.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game's progression is intricately tied to the unfolding narrative and the relationships built with the male leads. As players navigate through the chapters, they progressively unveil more layers of the overarching story. Simultaneously, players will build relationships in separate storylines with each of the three male leads, increasing their “Affinity” rating. You will sometimes go on dates together, reminisce memories, and at times it will intertwine with the main story.\r\nThere is a high degree of personalization via the initial character creator, subsequent cosmetic customization, allowing players to express their style and identity within the game. You can even change the characters female voice to your exact liking. Yes, your female character is voiced for most of the dialogue, which is pretty neat. You can turn it off though at any time in the options settings.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nI can’t say much about the monetization of Love and Deepspace yet, but what I do know is that it will feature gacha mechanics to acquire different cosmetics and memories for the three male leads. More powerful memories to equip means more powerful companions. As the game progresses towards its official release, the approach to monetization remains a crucial aspect to watch for, as it can significantly impact the overall player experience.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game features impressive 3D graphics but the optimization is equally as impressive. On my Snapdragon 888 device, the game recommended a max (Ultra) setting which is surprising, and the game delivers. There was never a framerate option, but the game felt smooth to play, both in real-time combat and especially during first person cutscenes.\r\nThe game primarily runs in portrait orientation by default, encompassing the game menus, dates, otome elements, and narrative cutscenes. However, during combat, it switches to landscape mode, which can be disorienting and potentially annoying. The occasional transition between landscape and portrait modes may disrupt the flow for some players. Personally, I would have preferred a consistently maintained orientation throughout the entirety of the game.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe CBT only offers a taste of its potential but I can already see that Love and Deepspace is a very promising title and offers a celestial journey through love and adventure. While predominantly tailored for female audiences, Love and Deepspace can easily transcend gender boundaries, appealing to a diverse audience with its unique blend of dating sim element, captivating narrative, immersive presentation with high-quality graphics and art direction, and engaging ARPG action.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6676293) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Resident Evil 4Global\r\n8.8\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nAction\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nThe 2023 GOTY contender Resident Evil 4 has finally made its mark on Apple devices, bringing the recent and already iconic survival horror experience to mobile phones, tablets, and Mac. Capcom's decision to release this remake on Apple devices is a significant milestone for mobile gaming, especially considering the game's recent release this year for current-gen consoles and PC. This is probably the first time we are getting a 1:1 mobile port of a technically and visually impressive AAA game, in the same year.\r\nAs one of the early AAA game releases for Apple devices, Resident Evil 4 adopts a free-to-download demo model, with the full game accessible through an in-app purchase. The base price of $60 might be a bit high for arguably the worst platform you can play it on, but a 50% launch discount to 30$ sounds very enticing.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Same 1:1 gameplay experience, as its PC/Console counterparts\r\n- Well balanced survival horror and action elements\r\n- Fluid and satisfying combat\r\n- Compelling story and progression\r\n## Cons\r\n- Touch control implementation is borderline unplayable. A controller is highly recommended\r\n- Resolution and textures are not very sharp looking\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nResident Evil 4 continues the story of Leon S. Kennedy, picking up a few years later where Resident Evil 2 left off. Leon is on a new mission to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the US president. The remake introduces additional story elements and scenes, expanding on the original game and incorporating flashbacks from Resident Evil 2's remake. The tone of the story has shifted to a more serious and realistic one, eschewing the cheesy one-liners and presenting a more vulnerable Leon. While characters remain consistent with their original versions, some charm has been toned down for the sake of realism.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nGranted, this iOS/iPadOS port has undergone some noticeable visual downgrades compared to its PC and console counterparts, but it remains impressive considering they are current-gen games that released earlier in the year, now running on an iPhone. In general, the visual quality is still a significant leap from the original 2005 game, featuring realistic environments, lifelike lighting, and stunning character details. The dark medieval setting and meticulous attention to detail contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere. Character models and animations are well-crafted, and the realistic hair effects add to the overall visual appeal\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nResident Evil 4 Remake on mobile is the exact same game as its PC and console counterparts: a third-person shooter offering weighty movement and shooting mechanics that make players feel every action Leon takes. The game balances action-packed shooter gameplay with a terrifying horror experience. The linear, chapter-based adventure takes players through creepy cult-like settlements, providing a mix of enemy encounters and challenging puzzles. Boss fights with unique mechanics punctuate the journey, creating a well-rounded gameplay experience.\r\nThe remake in general introduces quality-of-life improvements, allowing Leon to engage in melee combat and counter enemy attacks. Optional challenges, mini-games, and bounties enhance exploration and offer additional content. The gameplay is more fluid and convenient than the original classic, providing players with freedom while preserving the core Resident Evil 4 experience.\r\nI have no qualms about the game itself: it’s truly a wonderful reimagining of a masterpiece and a masterpiece in itself, with stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and an excellent narrative. I even rated it 5 out of 5 stars in my original review here https://www.taptap.io/post/4925421. Most of my gripes come from the approach taken in the mobile version and its few shortcomings.\r\n## 📱Mobile controls (Touch and Physical Controllers)\r\nThe touch controls are once again done in a similar approach to the implementation in Resident Evil Village. They just slapped a virtual on-screen gamepad on it and called it a day. It lacks full functionality and features you’d usually see in a native mobile game, making the touch-based experience clunky and challenging.\r\nMovement and aiming feel cumbersome on touch, especially when moving, aiming, and firing simultaneously with the on-screen joysticks, LT and RT. Even navigating the menus feels very counter-intuitive. The virtual joystick overlay, while customizable, falls short of providing an optimal touch control experience.\r\nPhysical controllers, such as PlayStation or Xbox gamepads, are highly recommended for a superior gameplay experience, and perhaps the ONLY way to enjoy this title. This makes the game immediately more playable and comparable to let’s say playing it on a Steam Deck or a portable PS4.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI played the game on an iPad Pro M1 model which targets a 1600x1118 resolution at 30FPS, but the game is also available for the iPhone 15 Pro which targets a 1560x720 resolution at 30FPS. For simplification purposes, let’s just say M1 devices target around under 1080p while the new iPhones target a little over 720p. Performance is a little bit better here now in my experience compared to RE: Village, and for a 30FPS portable experience, it’s even a job well done.\r\nThe visuals is also less than optimal in my eyes, with lots of aliasing (jagged edges). The graphics is a bit grainy looking and sometimes results into awkward looking visual artifacts especially during cutscenes, and it's definitely noticeable here especially if you have experienced this title in more powerful hardware such as on the PC or PS5.\r\nIn terms of settings, the game on iPad and iPhone does not support the adjustment of resolution or frame rate settings. This is noticeable different from Resident Evil Village’s approach where you can tweak all aspects of the graphics, which, in my opinion, is better here as having an optimized setting is probably the ideal way to experience the game, rather than attempting to maximize every aspect. Nevertheless, having the option to tweak some settings through an advanced option, instead of outright locking them, would have been a more nicer.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nResident Evil 4 is still that remarkable 2023 remake, just now on iPhone/iPad/Mac. Showcasing great attention to detail, visual fidelity, and gameplay improvements that position it among the best remakes to date. The game skillfully balances action and horror, providing a fresh experience even for those familiar with the original. Despite some minor drawbacks in this portable release, such as the subpar touch controls, noticeable visual downgrades, and limited 30FPS performance, Resident Evil 4 easily squeezes itself to my top 10 mobile games for this year and deserves your attention. Just ensure you have a controller to play this with and don’t even bother with the touch controls.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6683238) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Cub\r\n8.6\r\nAdventure\r\nPuzzle\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nThe Cub is a story-rich puzzle-platformer game set in a post-apocalyptic Earth, where the majority of humans have abandoned the planet for Mars. Only a few remnants remain on the surface, coexisting mostly peacefully with the animals in order to survive. The game is set to release on January 2024, for PC, Xbox Series, PlayStation, and Switch. With a Demo available to try on Steam.\r\n## ⭐️Demo Score: 10/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game is set in the aftermath of the so-called Great Ecological Catastrophe, where the ultrarich escape to Mars, leaving the rest of humanity to perish. The protagonist, a small immune child known as The Cub — raised and cared for by wolves since he was a child, becomes the target of the returning Mars inhabitants.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Sound\r\nThe graphics are drawn and stylized to resemble classic animated films of the late '90s, such as Atlantis and Tarzan. As a result, the game also bears a resemblance to beloved classic platformer games for PS1, like Tarzan and Hercules. It successfully blends nostalgia with a touch of modernity, especially evident in its clean HD artwork. The overall art style is simply beautiful, along with its soundtrack which is mesmerizing, catchy, and memorable.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay revolves around a simple yet effective platformer with straightforward jumping, swinging, and climbing mechanics. The controls are responsive and easy to grasp, allowing players to navigate the challenging environment without complexity.  Although, there is a bit of unforgiveness as there’s no health system: one hit or one hazard, and you’re dead and back to the last checkpoint.\r\nThe game explores escape, exploration, and discovery through urban ruins, unraveling the mysteries of humanity's fall and immersing us in the world full of wonder, life, and death. Each level tells a story, presenting players with clues scattered throughout crumbling tower blocks, abandoned labs, irradiated mines, and overgrown war-torn urbanscapes.\r\nThe demo is so fire, playing through the roughly 20-minute experience, it hits all the right notes for me. From its atmospheric presentation and immersive world-building to the nostalgic platformer, It checks all the boxes for what I find interesting. The art style is superb. The world-building is immersive, blending my fascination with space exploration with the intriguing angle of humans as a spacefaring species facing ecological disaster.\r\n## 🌍A truly immersive experience, from the narrative to the radio broadcasts\r\nThere are amazing radio broadcasts that the player will listen to via his scavenged astronaut helmet, and the radio broadcast here is done wonderfully — with kick-ass music and soothing DJ talk that I could actually listen to all day — and makes me feel like I’m really living in that world, and experiencing the adventure first hand, it really adds a lot to the immersiveness and atmosphere of the game. At first I thought that audio was bugging out, but the broadcast actually cuts off when you’re going underground, underwater, or going indoor — which was a surprisingly immersive touch.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe roughly 20-minute demo only showed a glimpse of the game's prowess, but I'm thoroughly impressed so far. This demo of The Cub is probably one of the best Demo’s I’ve played recently, and already has me sold on the game’s concept and idea. If you love a beautiful atmospheric platformer with a kick-ass soundtrack and immersive world-building, then The Cub is probably right up your alley, a 10/10 Demo experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6683477) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Granted, you’d need to have a reliable internet service to be able to stream these games, and preferably are located in US and Canada for consistent play and latency, at least for now.\r\n## 🔗Join the Playfest >>\r\n## 📅 Schedule\r\nPlayfest Winners & Player Rewards Announcement: January 8, 12 AM PT.\r\nFor my personal cloud gaming experience in this specific, please see further below in the review.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nThe game offers four single-player campaigns exploring the origins of Titans, The overarching premise revolves around the clash of Titans in a world where nowhere is safe from their wrath. It’s not included in the Demo edition, so you’d have to purchase the game to experience the story mode.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe graphics in GigaBash feature a stylized 3D design and a cartoony aesthetic; vibrant, and colorful visual effects, with fully destructible environments that are filled with detail. The fully destructible environments, complete with small citizens running around and perishing amidst the chaos, add depth and immersion to the experience. The constant evolution of maps, from flooding lavas to exploding buildings, enhances the dynamic nature of the game.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nIn GigaBash, players can choose from a colorful roster of 10 unique characters, each with its own moveset and playstyle. The objective is to unleash havoc and evolve into the terrifying S-Class form.  Each character; Kaiju or Mecha, has different skins available so that all players can pick the same one and still look different from each other.\r\nGigaBash offers a diverse range of gameplay modes, catering to both solo and multiplayer experiences.  Players can engage in free-for-all battles, team-based matchups, and even cooperative modes against waves of AI enemies. There is also Duel mode for head-to-head clashes, and a variety of minigames for the ultimate party experience. The demo strictly required a controller, so using keyboard and mouse is out of the question.\r\nThe easy-to-learn mechanics make the game accessible, while the potential for mastery lies in timing attacks, blocking opponents, using grabs and specials, and building up the meter to reveal the final, even bigger S-Class form.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat in GigaBash is fun, energetic, and, chaotic. Each Kaiju or Mecha feels distinct and plays fantastically, with their own movesets and playstyles. The controls are a bit clunky and hard to get used to; the animations sometimes feel stiff; plus the movesets can get a bit repetitive for each character, regardless, I found the overall experience engaging nonetheless, and fun especially if you are playing with friends.\r\nThe emphasis on destructible environments makes the game a whole lot more enjoyable than a traditional brawler, as you can pretty much smash buildings, throw, and kick enemies through them and completely level the city.\r\n## ⚖️Demo Features and Conclusion\r\nThe demo of the game only gave access to Couch Coop mode, with four maps and three characters unlocked, but so far the experience has been awesome and this is easily a game worth getting if you love Kaijus and have some buddies to play it with.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise. The quality is seriously impressive - we're talking sharp HD resolution, not like your typical streamed game. Looks and feels native and doesn’t feel like its streamed. The performance is also smooth (60FPS), with good frame timing (by visual observation only, as there was no tool to monitor this). There’s currently no way to play at a native 16:9 with black bars, as the screen is stretched out to the phone’s screen.\r\n## 📶Cloud Latency\r\nIn my experience, my latency during the test phase was around 200ms --- only because the servers are currently located in United States for now and I'm connecting from asia. Even then, It’s still a bit playable, especially for games that are not latency sensitive like point and click games or those with simple controls. Having said that, it’s just a matter of server location and having lots of servers. It’s understandable since this is just a testing phase with limited servers. If a datacenter is nearby, I am positive that I’ll have a smooth and fluid experience, same with those living in the US or Canada. It works like a charm on 5GHz wifi, but the experience took a hit on 2.4GHz, so won’t recommend that.\r\n## 🕹Cloud Touch Controls\r\nNow, onto the user interface. I'm a fan of how each game has its own custom on-screen buttons, tailored to the specific control scheme. It works like a charm for simpler games, but things get a bit tricky with more complex ones.\r\n## 🔃Cloud Accessibility\r\nAccessing the service is a breeze - the Instant Play integration is right there on the game page, next to Download/Steam/Play buttons.  Loading times are impressively fast, and I love that I can minimize the TapTap app and return to the game still streaming. Progress is not yet saved between streaming sessions, so it’s clearly just for testing purposes. Overall, it's been an interesting experience, and while there are some kinks, the potential here is exciting. Definitely surpassed my expectations.\r\n## 🌩Specific Cloud Game Experience\r\nGigaBash is fully playable experience on cloud despite its numerous complex brawler controls, its easily manageable and if you’re anything used to mobile games, this will feel like a native title. The real-time combat requires optimally low latency, but since it’s just a casual experience, it’s not a strict requirement to enjoy the game. I played with 200ms and Its still quite playable.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654221) Originally posted on TapTap.",

That’s about it, and I’m not even entirely sure, as I’m just guessing based on what I’m seeing.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe retro dark pixel art style attempts to evoke nostalgia from the NES / Family Computer era, and it does, reminding me of games like Tetris, but it comes off as more of a lazy attempt at aesthetics. The soundtrack is also retro in its 8-bit music, adds to the nostalgic value, but not nothing really special.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nDevil Slot Machine is a mix of pinball, rogue-lite, and casino gambling gameplay. Demons rush to fall down the playfield , bouncing around towers Pinball style, and you have to strategically upgrade the towers along the way and shoot cards upwards to stop them from falling. For every demon that passes through, you lose one Health.\r\nHealth is everything, it is your currency too; used for upgrades, tower placement, and rerolls. There are resource management aspects as well, as you’d have to balance your HP over buying upgrades and placing towers across the Playfield. You have a character on the bottom of the playfield shooting cards upwards, in the hopes of helping to stop the onslaught of falling demons.\r\nThe Demo's tutorial does a poor job of explaining mechanics, leaving players to stumble through matches with little understanding. I had no clue for my first two matches and had to brute force learning it by reading the poorly translated tooltips. The English localization is poorly made, so it only adds to the confusion about the mechanics and how cards work.\r\nThe pacing is horrendously slow, with unskippable animations and the pointless ringing of the bell TWICE to end/start a turn being annoying (There should at least be a visual cue to the player). The only thing you can skip in this demo are the dialogues, and even that is done very poorly; you skip straight to the next line instead of skipping the ultra-slow crawl of text — another annoying aspect. The unskippable animations and slow pacing overall compound the issue, making the overall experience feel tedious and needlessly convoluted.\r\nAs for it’s mechanics, I found that the game is simply poorly balanced; my experience is that it relies a lot on RNG more than anything, more than your skill to move the character around to shoot cards, or more than your tactics to strategically buy and place towers.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nOut of all the possible buttons they could have used to move the character around to shoot cards, they actually decided to choose mouse movement, which is by far the worst kind and doesn’t give precision to the player, instead of let’s say, the arrow keys. Other aspects are the point-and-click mechanics for upgrading shops, placing towers, or rerolling.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI don’t know if this was a feature I accidentally stumbled upon or a bug, but my progression in the demo was constantly giving me zero lives to start any run. I could not buy anything, but I could not die either. I just sat back and watched the game play itself without me doing anything aside from clicking the ball. Restarting, or reinstalling the game did not fix the issue.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nOverall, Devil Slot Machine is a gambling rogue-lite that is confusing, annoyingly slow, and relies too much on RNG with not much element of skill. I don't know the target market for this, if it even exists, but I’m sure as hell not part of it. The promising concept falls flat in the execution, turning what could be an engaging experience into a frustrating ordeal.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise.

Tower placement feels natural, and everything is controlled using point-and-click touch controls. The game relies almost entirely on point-and-click interactions; however, I did encounter some difficulties when controlling the character firing the cards at the bottom or displaying tooltips/stats for the different towers.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654276) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game truly succeeds in making the player feel like the unstoppable force of nature that the frog represents.\r\nThe combination of ultra chaotic bullet hell elements, mowing down hundreds of foes on the screen with ultra-fluid frame rates, and retro-style farming sim visuals is perfectly fine-tuned to be oddly satisfying.

Granted, you’d need to have a reliable internet service to be able to stream these games, and preferably are located in US and Canada for consistent play and latency, at least for now.\r\n## 🔗Join the Playfest >>\r\n## 📅 Schedule\r\nPlayfest Winners & Player Rewards Announcement: January 8, 12 AM PT.\r\nFor my personal cloud gaming experience in this specific, please see further below in the review.\r\nWhen we think of a top-down view, we often think of games with an isometric top view instead, such as Diablo or Pokemon. However, Devil Slayer - Raksasi is different; it features a REAL, literal top-down view for its camera angle. It's a bit disorienting at first, it feels like the camera is stuck, and there's an innate need to adjust it. However, you can't adjust it since it's by design. After a few minutes of adjustment, the game actually provides a refreshing new camera perspective to game on, if you can adapt to it. This style is not new by the way; and it kinda feels nostalgic in a sense, having played the original GTA games.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nDevil Slayer - Raksasi is set in a world plagued by wars, disasters, and demonic threats. The world is depressed, everyone is depressed, but hot. Devil Slayer - Raksasi introduces a group of attractive female individuals determined to dispel the darkness. The narrative incorporates roguelike mechanics, offering a series of trials for chosen heroes to find the key to saving the world.  You can piece together bits of lore are scattered around the procedurally generated levels, and the narrative is well integrated into the multiple rogue-lite runs the players will take. The game recognizes your do-overs as it is part of the narrative.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe art style of Devil Slayer - Raksasi is kinda artistically bleak, matching with the tone of the premise. The dark and detailed visuals, coupled with muted color palettes, evoke a sense of gloom and despair. There is a certain stiffness in the animations, as Anime looking characters seem like amateurish puppet-loking Adobe Flash animations. Despite this, the overall visual presentation is solid, the HD-2D-esque visuals are simply gorgeous and charming, although your appreciation may be limited by the strict top-down camera angle.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game distinguishes itself by offering a challenging hack and slash experience that focuses on methodical — almost Samurai-like — battles. The character is bound by a stamina mechanic and moves rather slower than players might be used to. As a Devil Slayer, you must progress through a series of levels, with procedurally generated rooms, and clear them one by one. At the end of chapter lies a boss fight, with diverse types of bosses to combat, and they are also part of the randomization. Defeat the boss and you can proceed to the next chapter, and choose your branch path.\r\nThere are seven buxom waifu characters that are progressively unlocked as you punch through the levels and defeat more bosses. These characters come with each of their own starting weapon style. For example, the first character was the swordswoman Byleth, but I immediately unlocked the spear wielding Ajiela, the warrior Kharoum, and the dual wielding Xilvaron in my first hour of play. There are diverse fighting styles, rogue-lite style itemizations, and passive bonuses that contributes to the overall depth of the gameplay.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat in Devil Slayer - Raksasi is tactical, methodical, and slower-paced compared to typical action or rogue-lite games. The diversity of weapons and fighting styles among the seven heroines adds a layer of strategy to encounters. But these fighting styles aren’t really special, as enemies can also be seen using these exact same animations, depending on the weapon their holding.\r\nDodging, timing, and rhythm skills take precedence over grinding and lightning fast reflexes, providing a more tactical skill-based approach to progression. The control scheme is responsive, on either controllers or using mouse and keyboard. However, the aforementioned amateurish animations might take away some of the responsiveness a bit and add an additional challenge, a potentially frustrating one. Despite being slower in nature, the game isn’t automatically easy, as it can still be a difficult game to master, perhaps even more so with its random difficulty spikes that might hit you during runs. Some enemies can be significantly more difficult than others. Again, it adds to the frustration, but it’s not a dealbreaker.\r\n## ⏫Rogue-lite Progression\r\nDevil Slayer - Raksasi is a simple and fun roguelite experience with its rewarding gameplay and the depth provided by diverse heroines and weapons. The progression system includes roguelike elements with randomly generated levels and countless relic combinations for a fresh experience in each run.\r\nThe game currently offers six chapters, and each chapter will have multiple paths that you can take that will depend on the rewards and challenges that you prefer. It’s not a massive game, but there are 167 types of enemies, and 212 relics as of writing.\r\nDying doesn’t automatically sentence you to a restart of the run, because there’s a necklace provided for you that allows up to five revives to the previous room. Pretty neat, and somewhat makes the game a Rogue–lite-lite, but as a casual-centric player that has left the days of intense sweaty gaming far behind, I will always appreciate a more forgiving mechanic.\r\nThere are other gameplay modes aside from the main rogue-lite campaign. Players can participate in training trials, which are basically challenges to complete with predetermined objectives. Players can also try the Boss Run campaigns once they've encountered all the required bosses for each campaign.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game runs at over 100 FPS on my gaming PC, stable overall and I haven’t encountered any game-breaking bugs. However, while having 100 FPS, it actually feels and looks sluggish to me. It's probably due to the animations and slower gameplay. I didn’t find this to be an issue, though, and I proceeded to have fun regardless.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nUltimately, Devil Slayer - Raksasi may appeal to those who enjoy challenging roguelike experiences and who are looking to try something else for a change, particularly — a more methodical combat and a different camera view. However, potential players should be aware of the game's divisive aspects, particularly in terms it’s camera angle, clunky animations, and random difficulty spikes.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise. The quality is seriously impressive - we're talking sharp HD resolution, not like your typical streamed game. Looks and feels native and doesn’t feel like its streamed. The performance is also smooth (60FPS), with good frame timing (by visual observation only, as there was no tool to monitor this). There’s currently no way to play at a native 16:9 with black bars, as the screen is stretched out to the phone’s screen.\r\n## 📶Cloud Latency\r\nIn my experience, my latency during the test phase was around 200ms --- only because the servers are currently located in United States for now and I'm connecting from asia. Even then, It’s still a bit playable, especially for games that are not latency sensitive like point and click games or those with simple controls. Having said that, it’s just a matter of server location and having lots of servers. It’s understandable since this is just a testing phase with limited servers. If a datacenter is nearby, I am positive that I’ll have a smooth and fluid experience, same with those living in the US or Canada. It works like a charm on 5GHz wifi, but the experience took a hit on 2.4GHz, so won’t recommend that.\r\n## 🕹Cloud Touch Controls\r\nNow, onto the user interface. I'm a fan of how each game has its own custom on-screen buttons, tailored to the specific control scheme. It works like a charm for simpler games, but things get a bit tricky with more complex ones.\r\n## 🔃Cloud Accessibility\r\nAccessing the service is a breeze - the Instant Play integration is right there on the game page, next to Download/Steam/Play buttons.  Loading times are impressively fast, and I love that I can minimize the TapTap app and return to the game still streaming. Progress is not yet saved between streaming sessions, so it’s clearly just for testing purposes. Overall, it's been an interesting experience, and while there are some kinks, the potential here is exciting. Definitely surpassed my expectations.\r\n## 🌩Specific Cloud Game Experience\r\nDepite most games I’ve tested being mostly playable in this very early state of TapTap cloud gaming, I’ve found Devil Slayer - Raksasi mostly unplayable due to challenging aiming and complex controls that do not align well with the on-screen touch layout. The game is highly latency-dependent, particularly in real-time evasion against enemies, and unfortunately, my 200ms ping due to being located far from the US servers makes it unplayable for me, it’s unforgiving rogue-lite nature further compounds the unplayability.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654047) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Rogue-lite elements? Low-fi vibrant visuals? check. A featured game on Pocket Playfest, Core Devourer is an upcoming game that looks really close to Risk of Rain 2 with its low-poly style 3D environment with a stylized and somewhat cel-shaded aesthetic. Then taken apart mechanically and put back in a Vampire Survivors suit.\r\nThe game is a twin-stick arena shooter where you clear the open map of all robots and bosses. The primary objective is to confront colossal hordes of droids, absorb their cores, and ascend as the most potent cybernetic entity on the planet.  The game features procedurally generated maps, with randomized power-up choices gained from killing enemies and gathering EXP.\r\nOverall, the combat is challenging, fun, and encourages experimentation, and I am very excited to see how the final product will play out, being a huge fan of both Risk of Rain 2 and Vampire Survivors. A demo is currently available on Steam, free for everyone to try. Seriously, that demo alone can be satisfying to play for hours already.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654236) Originally posted on TapTap.",

While the game is slated for release early next year and is not out yet, I had the opportunity to play the available Demo, and boy it did a really good job of Demoing the game.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\nPocket Playfest: An Indie Celebration 2023 Winter Edition\r\nIn a recent hands-on exclusive experience this past weekend, I had the privilege of testing a handful of titles on TapTap's experimental cloud gaming service, setting the stage for this 16-day event where indie game developers show-off their creations exclusively on the TapTap mobile platform — fully playable PC games without the need for an actual PC, Android/iOS version, or the need to download the games and install them.  Granted, you’d need to have a reliable internet service to be able to stream these games, and preferably are located in US and Canada for consistent play and latency, at least for now.\r\n## 🔗Join the Playfest >>\r\n## 📅 Schedule\r\nPlayfest Winners & Player Rewards Announcement: January 8, 12 AM PT.\r\nFor my personal cloud gaming experience in this specific, please see further below in the review.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nThe premise is simply absurd; that's the single word I would use to describe this game. Just when I thought I had seen every permutation of indie genres out there, another one arrives with an unlikely mix of farming sim and bullet hell roguelite genres… Farming sims are supposed to be relaxing, and this still is?\r\nA frog is out to defend its farm, all while attempting to plant weaponized crops that sprout bombs, pitchfork, and seeds, all used as weapons. Not only that, the frog also wants to mine and fish while caring for pets, all at the same time. A pretty HUGE responsibility for this poor Frog.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nPesticide Not Required features pixel art retro-style visuals that perfectly complement its quirky premise. The character animations are low-bit quality, but the actual mobility is actually fluid and smooth, especially how the enemy units and the frog slides across the map and how the UI and Menu’s are animated.. The colors are a bit muted though, and during night time it can get harder to see.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay of Pesticide Not Required is a harmonious blend of bullet hell, horde survival, and roguelite elements, with a unique twist of farming mechanics. Players are tasked with mowing down waves of enemies, cultivating crops, and crafting ultra chaotic bullet-hell rogue-lite builds.\r\nEverything you have in this game comes for cultivating crops. Weapons? Planted and grown. EXP? Planted and grown. Gold drops from enemies? You get to buy new seed to plant, or expand your plot to plant more crops. Farming is ingrained in this bullet hell rogue-lite and it works really well. To top it off, the game features day/night cycles and the shop only opens during morning time.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe game controls as a twin-stick auto-attack shooter, so you’d have to aim using the right stick or mouse to aim on certain attacks. Some attacks auto-aim, but most do not. It’s a bit disorienting seeing the frog not changing his orientation around while you aim in a different direction, and sometimes I lose track of the mouse, but you get used to it after a few minutes of play. Still, I would have loved a completely auto-aim mechanic like in Vampire Survivors.\r\nPlanting crops, watering them, and gathering them all works automatically, you just have to get in proximity to trigger the action. The same goes for Mining, Fishing, and other activities on the arena like interacting with the Store.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nYou don’t need pesticide because YOU are the pesticide, in the form of a bullet hell-spewing frog, dodging and weaving through swarms of enemies while unleashing their own barrage of attacks. The variety of weapons and the ability to craft unique builds with 40+ stats ensure that each run feels fresh and exciting. The game truly succeeds in making the player feel like the unstoppable force of nature that the frog represents.\r\n## 🌾It’s still relaxing, what the hell?\r\nThe combination of ultra chaotic bullet hell elements, mowing down hundreds of foes on the screen with ultra-fluid frame rates, and retro-style farming sim visuals is perfectly fine-tuned to be oddly satisfying. Playing the game is almost, if not already, a therapeutic experience.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nPesticide Not Required is a rogue-lite so almost everything resets when you die or beat a map. But there is still persistent skill tree upgradesthat  provide a sense of long-term progression,as well as unlockable new frog (or frog-ish?) characters that have different characteristics, keeping players invested in the game over multiple runs.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nPesticide Not Required’s absurd premise, coupled with the perfect balance of bullet hell chaos and farming tranquility, creates an experience that is both entertaining and therapeutic. As I said earlier, just one run of the demo was all it took for me to be completely sold on this game. Unfortunately it’s not out yet, but if it was, I’d highly recommend it to any Vampire Survivor fans out there looking for their next fix… especially if they also happen to love Farming Sims.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise.

Overall, it's been an interesting experience, and while there are some kinks, the potential here is exciting. Definitely surpassed my expectations.\r\n## 🌩Specific Cloud Game Experience\r\nPesticide Not Required delivers a fully playable experience on the cloud, relying solely on the left stick for character control. The menus are mostly navigable using touch controls, making it arguably the best game I've played on the cloud thus far in both gameplay, user interface, and accessibility. Despite featuring real-time combat, the health system is forgiving, allowing for a few mistakes here and there. As a result, its dependency on latency is not as pronounced as in the other rogue-lite games I've tested.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654265) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game's visuals are characterized by a dark and exaggerated cartoon aesthetic, featuring hand-drawn characters with elongated limbs and combining 2D graphics with a gothic and whimsical atmosphere.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nWild Legion presents a rogue-like experience with auto-attack hoard survival at its core. The ability to wield multiple weapons and magic spells feels very much close to Brotato’s gameplay mechanics. Equip them all and use them all at the same time, automatically firing and swinging at enemies. There is an option to toggle manual targeting for long range weapons, which kinda turns the game into a Twin Stick shooter.  The weapons range from typical knives, swords and medieval weapons like hammers and axes, to modern day firearms like shotguns and rifles.\r\nAdditionally, the game features optional tower defense elements by gathering trees around the arena and crafting towers to assist you. By saying optional, I mean there is an option to fully automate it, allowing you to focus on the traditional horde survival gameplay if you prefer.\r\nScattered throughout the arena are some minor flavors that add more layer to the gameplay. Pets to capture and rescue, and the Moon Tower to defend at night. During the day, enemies only attack you, but come night time, they’ll go for the Moon Tower if it spawns and you must defend it or else you’ll also die. There is only one character playable in the demo for now, but there are slots for a lot more currently locked, if it’s anything close to Brotato’s character system, then the different characters will cater to different playstyles; Melee, Ranged, Guns, Tank, Magic, and more.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat in Wild Legion is fast-paced and intense, as players battle hordes of enemies while strategically using multiple weapons and spells. The game's emphasis on auto-attack hoard survival requires players to navigate through waves of adversaries, utilizing a combination of weapons, spells, and towers for effective defense.\r\nMost enemies are melee but there are also ranged projectile attacks to avoid, especially from high level enemies and bosses. Wild Legion also features ultimate “S-rank” version of weapons when at max level and combined with other items which is similar to how ultimate weapons are handheld in Vampire Survivors.\r\nThe combat is enjoyable; however, one gripe I have is that the spawn timer, starting from displaying the \"X\" indicator on the ground, is too fast, giving players almost no time to react and avoid standing on the spawn. This has damaged me more often than I have control over.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nWild Legion introduces a progression system where players unlock an array of deadly weapons, powerful equipment, and mystical spells. The ability to stack buffs and unlock S-rank attacks enhances the player's arsenal, providing a sense of accomplishment and growth.\r\nUnlike most contemporaries, where you need to finish a wave or level to access the weapon or item shop, you can access the shop at any point in this game, and the cost of rerolling is low. There is a high chance of achieving your target build and the game does not rely too much on RNG.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game, at least the demo, suffered from horrible frame rate drops in late-game segments when you have multiple ultimate weapons and massive hordes of enemies coming for you. It takes away from the enjoyment, and the game is almost unplayable during these slowdowns. I do hope this is resolved for the release version.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWild Legion, with its auto-attack hoard survival gameplay and a blend of genres, presents another intriguing addition to the rogue-like genre with its mix of many gameplay elements from adjacent genres. While the demo provides a taste of the game's potentially fun nature, it also highlights the need for optimization to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. As Wild Legion prepares for its Early Access release in Q1 2024, addressing technical issues and refining gameplay mechanics will be pivotal in realizing the game's full potential.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise.

Overall, it's been an interesting experience, and while there are some kinks, the potential here is exciting. Definitely surpassed my expectations.\r\n## 🌩Specific Cloud Game Experience\r\nWild Legion is semi-playable on the cloud and requires some adaptation time due to minor UI quirks such as small buttons and UI elements; especially in the buy menu where the difference between upgrading a weapon or selling it is merely a few pixels only that you’ll more or less misclick most of the time due to the phone’s small screen nature. There is dependency on the Latency, especially when evading enemies in real-time. Additionally, touch controls may not navigate all menus, and sometimes require using the virtual joystick in certain situations.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654040) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The objective is to unleash havoc and evolve into the terrifying S-Class form.  Each character; Kaiju or Mecha, has different skins available so that all players can pick the same one and still look different from each other. It comes with its own original cast of characters, but you can also buy the Godzilla and Ultraman DLC to really get the most out of this game.\r\nThe emphasis on destructible environments makes the game a whole lot more enjoyable than a traditional brawler, as you can pretty much smash buildings, throw, and kick enemies through them and completely level the city. The constant evolution of maps, from flooding lavas to exploding buildings, enhances the dynamic nature of the game.\r\nThe combat in GigaBash is fun, energetic, and, chaotic. Each Kaiju or Mecha feels distinct and plays fantastically, with their own movesets and playstyles. The controls are a bit clunky and hard to get used to; the animations sometimes feel stiff; plus the movesets can get a bit repetitive for each character, regardless, I found the overall experience engaging nonetheless, and fun especially if you are playing with friends. It probably the best Kaiju fighting game out there and I highly recommend even just trying the Demo, it even allows you to play couch multiplayer.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654220) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Granted, you’d need to have a reliable internet service to be able to stream these games, and preferably are located in US and Canada for consistent play and latency, at least for now.\r\n## 🔗Join the Playfest >>\r\n## 📅 Schedule\r\nPlayfest Winners & Player Rewards Announcement: January 8, 12 AM PT.\r\nFor my personal cloud gaming experience in this specific, please see further below in the review.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nHeaven Dust 2 serves as a stand-alone sequel to the first game, but with continuity and connection for those who have played it.  The narrative unfolds after a virus outbreak in the mysterious First Research Center following a press conference. The protagonist, Steve, wakes up in a sleeping pod in a laboratory infested by zombies. As he fights to escape, a dreadful truth begins to unfold. The story isn't really a strong part of the game; there's no voice acting or cinematic cutscenes like in the Resident Evil games. However, I wouldn't say that it's weak. It serves more as a simple backdrop to the gameplay.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nHeaven Dust 2 features visually appealing chibi-style graphics design with dynamic lighting. The graphics have evolved alot compared to the first game, while still maintaining that unique Chibi arts style. The top-down angle horror game provides a unique perspective reminiscent of the Resident Evil series, but with a consistent 45 degree angle that follows the player and doesn’t transition to any other angles or view as you play. To provide clear visibility, walls and obstacles will get transparent as you move around the world – like in The Sims — although sometimes it could still block the player’s view and could become a source of frustration.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay in Heaven Dust 2 draws inspiration from the original Resident Evil games, replicating controls, combat mechanics, puzzles, inventory management, and even the iconic zombie encounters. Players navigate a detailed world filled with secret areas, optional puzzles, and hidden items. The game offers three difficulty levels (Casual, Normal, and Expert), each influencing the campaign's progression and unlocking unique weapons upon completion.\r\nThere are multiple escape routes leading to different endings adds depth to the narrative, which is beatable in around five hours or so, with good replayabilty due to multiple endings and new weapon unlocks. The level design is showcased by a huge map that displays item locations, locked doors, save points, weapon upgrade points, and more.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nHeaven Dust 2 introduces an evolved combat system with a variety of weapons, including a dagger, submachine gun, shotgun, and grenades. It’s still classic Resident Evil style of gunplay, but you can walk slowly while aiming. The aiming system adapts aim-assist mechanics while still adhering to Tank-style controls of the past era, with the option to land a critical headshot if you just take your time. The aim assist serves as a cool mechanic, although sometimes it works against the player, especially when multiple targets are bunched together. More often than not, you'll find yourself targeting the wrong enemy or explosive barrel to shoot.\r\nPlayers can modify and upgrade their weapons, choosing the most effective tools to counter different enemies. The combat system extends beyond ordinary zombies, requiring the need to utilize multiple weaponry to effectively inflict damage to these different zombie types. For example, some zombies will have an exoskeleton of bones protecting them, and using a shotgun to blast them will effectively clear that bone armor easily.\r\n## 🕹Puzzles\r\nHeaven Dust 2 incorporates a variety of puzzles drawing inspiration from classic Resident Evil games, these puzzles challenge players' problem-solving skills and observational prowess.  Logical puzzles, such as riddles and codes, require careful deduction to unlock doors and access hidden areas. The game also features inventory management puzzles, where players must strategically decide which items to carry, use, or combine to progress.\r\nMechanical puzzles involve manipulating in-game mechanisms, while pattern recognition puzzles require players to match symbols or decode visual clues. Environmental puzzles turn the game world itself into a puzzle, encouraging exploration and manipulation of things such as pushing statues or boxes to uncover hidden paths and triggers.\r\nAll these puzzles are doable, but sometimes they are too nonsense and fall outside the realm of logical thinking, I can’t say some examples as to not spoil the puzzles, but let’s just say that some puzzles may provide clues that are overly ambiguous or difficult to interpret; or require a level of familiarity with certain gaming or puzzle-solving conventions, which bodes badly to those who are new to the genre and haven’t played classic survival horror games with similar puzzles.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWhile the graphics have been upgraded, they’re still not that demanding due to the chosen Chibi art style, this ensures a smooth experience without technical issues. Players can enjoy full controller support, making the game accessible to a wider audience. I bet this can even be ported to mobile phones too, following the first game’s direction.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nHeaven Dust 2 successfully builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, offering a thrilling survival horror experience reminiscent of classic Resident Evil games. The game impresses with its chibi-style graphics, engaging story, and well-optimized gameplay. The inclusion of various difficulty levels, playthrough unlocks, and exploration elements contributes to its replay value. The game doesn’t overstay its welcome, and its a nice affordable game to pass the time, beatable in a single sitting.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise. The quality is seriously impressive - we're talking sharp HD resolution, not like your typical streamed game. Looks and feels native and doesn’t feel like its streamed. The performance is also smooth (60FPS), with good frame timing (by visual observation only, as there was no tool to monitor this). There’s currently no way to play at a native 16:9 with black bars, as the screen is stretched out to the phone’s screen.\r\n## 📶Cloud Latency\r\nIn my experience, my latency during the test phase was around 200ms --- only because the servers are currently located in United States for now and I'm connecting from asia. Even then, It’s still a bit playable, especially for games that are not latency sensitive like point and click games or those with simple controls. Having said that, it’s just a matter of server location and having lots of servers. It’s understandable since this is just a testing phase with limited servers. If a datacenter is nearby, I am positive that I’ll have a smooth and fluid experience, same with those living in the US or Canada. It works like a charm on 5GHz wifi, but the experience took a hit on 2.4GHz, so won’t recommend that.\r\n## 🕹Cloud Touch Controls\r\nNow, onto the user interface. I'm a fan of how each game has its own custom on-screen buttons, tailored to the specific control scheme. It works like a charm for simpler games, but things get a bit tricky with more complex ones.\r\n## 🔃Cloud Accessibility\r\nAccessing the service is a breeze - the Instant Play integration is right there on the game page, next to Download/Steam/Play buttons.  Loading times are impressively fast, and I love that I can minimize the TapTap app and return to the game still streaming. Progress is not yet saved between streaming sessions, so it’s clearly just for testing purposes. Overall, it's been an interesting experience, and while there are some kinks, the potential here is exciting. Definitely surpassed my expectations.\r\n## 🌩Specific Cloud Game Experience\r\nHeaven Dust 2 offers a semi-playable experience on the cloud with challenging controls that do not mesh well with the on-screen touch layout, especially since the game displays keyboard and mouse prompts. Aiming proves difficult if not impossible due to non-existent implementation of touch controls to the game’s aiming mechanics, and the game is highly latency-dependent, requiring real-time reaction of evading zombies.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654055) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game explores a society fully automated with AI, with a focus on dialogue choices, relationship dynamics, and immersive storytelling, Minds Beneath Us promises a unique gaming experience.  I just played the demo, and while short, offers a glimpse into the game's huge potential, showcasing a compelling narrative and a visually stunning world.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\nPocket Playfest: An Indie Celebration 2023 Winter Edition\r\nIn a recent hands-on exclusive experience this past weekend, I had the privilege of testing a handful of titles on TapTap's experimental cloud gaming service, setting the stage for this 16-day event where indie game developers show-off their creations exclusively on the TapTap mobile platform — fully playable PC games without the need for an actual PC, Android/iOS version, or the need to download the games and install them.

This game showcases an impressive imagination when it comes to possible future technology. The game explores the consequences of a new industry that replaces traditional internet hardware with linked human brains.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nMinds Beneath Us impresses with its visually stunning presentation, combining hand-drawn animation and smooth camera movements to create a unique cinematic experience.  The visuals are a mix of animated 2D and 3D parallax-style environments. The neon-soaked futuristic rendition of Taipei is a sight to behold, even in its 2.5D animated form. They have really done a job well done in setting up the atmosphere and tone of the game. Simply put, I love it.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nMinds Beneath Us is basically an interactive cinematic experience with point and click puzzle game elements, and branching out dialogue options. Exploration, observation, and deduction are emphasized. Players are encouraged to scrutinize environments, pay attention to dialogue, and uncover hidden clues in each scene. Unlocking new dialogue choices adds depth to the interactive experience, fostering a sense of agency in shaping the narrative.\r\nThe demo is very short, comprising only the first 40 minutes of the game. The initial 20 minutes start out strong, blending near-future sci-fi and dystopian crime mystery elements. Subsequently, the last 20 minutes transition into a much cozier and slice-of-life narrative style, which feels really nice and has immersed me in the story and the lives of the characters involved, all within a span of 20 minutes.\r\nThe game is heavy on the narrative side, with numerous branching dialogue options, decision-making, and consequences for your actions. Apart from the usual point-and-click mechanics, there isn't much gameplay here, at least in the demo. Nevertheless, the game teases a \"mind-reading\" element that will likely complement the crime and mystery thriller tropes of the story, going hand in hand with the dialogue choices provided in the narrative.\r\n## 📅Release Date? because I’m very excited\r\nEven with the limited narrative and experience presented in the demo, it still got me really excited. I want to know what happens next to the characters in the story. Unfortunately, the release date is still 'To be announced,' so there's no clear indication of when it will be. I don't expect it to be anytime soon. We could be waiting for years, people.\r\nLuckily, the demo I played turns out to be more than 2 years old now, so I bet there's been a lot of progress made since then. Some websites also report that the game is slated to come out in 2024, but take this with a grain of salt.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nMinds Beneath Us is set to offer a compelling mix of sci-fi thriller, mystery, and interactive adventure. The game's futuristic setting, rich storytelling, and visually captivating presentation create a unique gaming experience. While the demo provides only a brief glimpse into the game's potential, it succeeds in getting me excited and anticipating the full release.\r\nUltimately, it’s a charming game with huge potential to be one of the better narrative indie games out there once it comes out. I do hope it doesn't take so long that I forget about the game entirely.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise.

Instead, players assume the role of a hero traveling across a medieval fantasy landscape, recruiting allies and facing strategic challenges. The absence of a rigid storyline gives players the freedom to craft their own adventure, relying on their strategic prowess in deckbuilding to shape the course of their hero's journey. You basically create your own narrative in this game. The role-playing and decision-making elements aren’t that deep, but they nonetheless provide an added immersion to the player centric narrative.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe game adopts a hand-painted, cartoonish art style that perfectly complements its deck builder and medieval fantasy themes. This artistic choice enhances the overall aesthetic, making the game visually appealing. The soundtrack, characterized by orchestral, triumphant heroic music, further immerses players in the world of Combo Card Clashers, aligning with the tone of the hero's journey. The sound effects in combat are satisfyingly well done as well, with gratifying slashing, blasting, and casting that makes the game even more fun to play.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nCombo Card Clashers merges the auto-battler and roguelike deckbuilder genres. There is a world map in which the character is free to choose his own path in a hex-grid overworld map, and the player must travel across to the other side; encountering enemies, random events, merchants, and recruiting allies along the way. It all culminates in a final boss battle, and if defeated, takes you to another land waiting to be explored.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nDuring combat encounters, players select cards for their combo grid, playing them all in a specific succession each turn. The gameplay centers around building a balanced deck, crafting powerful card combinations, and using tactical decisions to unveil each hero's mystery while attempting to save the world. The joy of the game lies in experimenting with different cards and their interactions, essentially allowing players to create spells and attacks of their own design.\r\nThere is a succession order as to how cards are activated, so placing them appropriately is key to success. Reading the cards description is very important, as you have to understand its mechanics and how it can possibly interact with other cards on your combo grid.\r\nFor example, you can add a cleave modifier card before a powerful attack, turning its attacks into splash damage. Perhaps, add a repeat card that basically repeats that whole rows effects, so you get an additional splash attack, provided that you have sufficient mana to activate the cards. A lot of ARPG games use this feature in its itemization, but here in Combo Card Clashers it is well integrated into the deckbuilding mechanics.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression system in Combo Card Clashers adds depth to the gameplay. Players can choose from three unique heroes, each offering a surprising and distinct playstyle. Although the demo I was only able to play two, the warrior and the mage.\r\nCustomizing the attributes of each hero and crafting their starting deck maximizes their potential. The progression loop involves leveling up, gaining attributes, equipping gear, upgrading cards, and finding relics that open up new paths to victory. With each run being truly unique and offering a plethora of options such as over 100 cards, randomly generated landscapes, gear, and events, the game ensures that no two playthroughs are the same.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI have no complaints about its performance, nor any technical issues. Everything appears rock solid, and in terms of stability, I’m comfortable in saying that it’s primed for release. The UI is well-crafted, and the interface is very easy to understand. The developers are even actively updating the demo version of the game as indicated on the store page, which speaks volumes about their commitment.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI have only played the demo version, but I can already see that Combo Card Clashers is a promising addition to the roguelike deckbuilder genre, offering a delightful blend of strategy, creativity, and replayability. Its unique combat system, where players craft their attacks and spells through card combinations, sets it apart from other games in the genre. Combo Card Clashers is a title worth keeping an eye on for fans of roguelike deckbuilders and those seeking a game that encourages strategic creativity.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise.

Since it’s a turn-based game, it’s not very latency dependent. So I was able to play even with 200ms latency. The cloud streaming app's setting button obstructs some menu buttons, rendering them unclickable, but other than that it’s a perfect experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654033) Originally posted on TapTap.",

It is a sequel to the original mobile game Candy Disaster TD, featuring very similar elements, and adds rogue-like deck-building elements to the franchise.\r\nGoing in blind with this game, the title obviously gave away that this is a game sequel, but I could not find any trace of a predecessor game called “CD” across Steam and the internet until I found out that it was actually titled Candy Disaster TD, primarily a mobile game that was also released on PC. Upon discovering that game, it became apparent that CD 2: Trap Master is indeed a sequel to that title, and these games appear remarkably similar.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\nPocket Playfest: An Indie Celebration 2023 Winter Edition\r\nIn a recent hands-on exclusive experience this past weekend, I had the privilege of testing a handful of titles on TapTap's experimental cloud gaming service, setting the stage for this 16-day event where indie game developers show-off their creations exclusively on the TapTap mobile platform — fully playable PC games without the need for an actual PC, Android/iOS version, or the need to download the games and install them.  Granted, you’d need to have a reliable internet service to be able to stream these games, and preferably are located in US and Canada for consistent play and latency, at least for now.\r\n## 🔗Join the Playfest >>\r\n## 📅 Schedule\r\nPlayfest Winners & Player Rewards Announcement: January 8, 12 AM PT\r\nFor my personal cloud gaming experience in this specific, please see further below in the review.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story is pretty basic for now, with the narrative revolving around a youthful ninja, which is weird because the game is set in a Dark European Medieval ages looking setting, not Japan or any East Asian location. This ninja is bound by a mysterious evil book to do its bidding, which is to slay some monsters using a variety of powerful contraptions and magic traps. Honestly, I find that story in its current state largely uninspired, and not it’s strong point.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style\r\nThe overall art style is a mix of gothic and macabre, featuring a dark and atmospheric tone for its 2D and card visuals, while the in-game 3D graphics are stylized and cartoonish with a dark yet vibrant color tone. They serve their purposes, but there is a bit of disconnect between the 2D and 3D art styles here. I’m not sure if all the models are placeholders for now, but they seem to be taken directly from Candy Disaster TD, with its cartoonish style units serving as the monsters to slay.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nCD 2: Trap Master is basically a tower defense game that utilizes deck-building for its trap and unit placement, while having a rogue-like progression system. It's kind of like if a rogue-like deckbuilder had a child with Orcs Must Die. The game is about pushing through a series of branching out paths across the lands that are chosen by the player, most of which will be a tower defense encounter of varying difficulties, in other times; a merchant to buy trinkets, treasures to loot, random events to encounter, or a campfire to rest and upgrade your Cards. Players start with a basic deck, and then loot more cards each run, players upgrade these cards, or swap them out via various NPCs they can find while traversing the pathways. The game has a lot of diverse cards that players can try out, and they’re all pretty fun to discover and use. These pathways culminate in a boss fight at the end, which ends the chapter and starts a new one.\r\n## ⚔️Tower Defense and Deck building\r\nThe tower defense gameplay is where the game shines the most. Tower defense encounters are a core element and will probably comprise 95% of your gameplay, featuring waves of enemies that demand strategic deployment of traps, contraptions, and magic. The level design is as uninspired as its narrative, featuring randomly looking assortments of directions, walls, and hazards that don't really make sense. It feels more like they are randomly generated or haphazardly placed rather than being well-thought-out.\r\nThe game employs resource-based card placement mechanics, starting players with first draw, and then allowing them to place these cards on the battlefield as they generate the required resources. Players can occasionally their cards with a short cooldown, so they have balance their resources, current cards in hand, and their redraw ability. As said earlier, the overall card roster is pretty fun discover and use, and there is a lot of depth and engaging strategic elements to the gameplay. If you love deckbuilding and tower defense, I think it’s safe to say that you’ll find many things to like in this game.\r\n## ⏫Rogue-like Progression\r\nWith all the rogue-lites out there populating the market, I think it's very important that this is a proper rogue-like game. There's only one progression, and when you die, everything resets – your level progression, your deck, and all your upgrades are gone. However, the game allows you to choose one random bonus modifier when starting another run.\r\nThere are role-playing sections and some semblance of narrative baked in while you traverse these pathways where you have to choose between different items, NPC dialog options, or responses to events, with corresponding rewards and penalties, but nothing amounts to anything substantial as far as the story goes, it’s all just added flavor and additional rogue-like mechanic.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe UI experience in CD 2: Trap Master is notably challenging in its Early Access version.  For example, the back button is so randomly placed throughout menus, sometimes its at the top left corner, sometimes it’s at the bottom right, sometimes it’s on the top right as an X button, sometimes its a ‘Leave’ button. The interface is not quite polished yet, and the developers and acknowledge this and are starting to tackle this.\r\nPerformance wise, the game ran ok and it’s perfectly playable without any game breaking bugs or crashes, which is a promising starting point for an Early Access release. I’ve experienced major stuttering from time to time, especially when placing units, opening new menus, or there’s loads of enemy populating the map. Which is unfortunate for a game that’s not that demanding in terms of visuals. I do hope the game becomes smoother as it receives more optimizations.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nCD 2: Trap Master excels in strategic depth, offering diverse card customization options for varied builds. However, in its current newly released in Early Access state, the uninspired narrative, level design and UI woes diminish the overall enjoyment. While technically playable, the game requires more time optimization to address stuttering and enhance performance.\r\nIn its current Early Access state, the game shows promise with its unique blend of tower defense, rogue-like progression, and deck-building mechanics. As mentioned earlier, it's safe to say that you'll find many things to like in this game if you love both genres. However, in its current state, it would be doing the game a disservice if you try to enjoy it fully as a game. Consider getting it only if you want to support the game financially or don't mind participating in an Early Access phase.\r\n## ☁️General Cloud Gaming Experience\r\nThis past weekend, I had the chance to be chosen as one of the testers for an experimental cloud gaming service by TapTap, and I must say, it holds a lot of promise. The quality is seriously impressive - we're talking sharp HD resolution, not like your typical streamed game. Looks and feels native and doesn’t feel like its streamed. The performance is also smooth (60FPS), with good frame timing (by visual observation only, as there was no tool to monitor this). There’s currently no way to play at a native 16:9 with black bars, as the screen is stretched out to the phone’s screen.\r\n## 📶Cloud Latency\r\nIn my experience, my latency during the test phase was around 200ms --- only because the servers are currently located in United States for now and I'm connecting from asia. Even then, It’s still a bit playable, especially for games that are not latency sensitive like point and click games or those with simple controls. Having said that, it’s just a matter of server location and having lots of servers. It’s understandable since this is just a testing phase with limited servers. If a datacenter is nearby, I am positive that I’ll have a smooth and fluid experience, same with those living in the US or Canada. It works like a charm on 5GHz wifi, but the experience took a hit on 2.4GHz, so won’t recommend that.\r\n## 🕹Cloud Touch Controls\r\nNow, onto the user interface. I'm a fan of how each game has its own custom on-screen buttons, tailored to the specific control scheme. It works like a charm for simpler games, but things get a bit tricky with more complex ones.\r\n## 🔃Cloud Accessibility\r\nAccessing the service is a breeze - the Instant Play integration is right there on the game page, next to Download/Steam/Play buttons.  Loading times are impressively fast, and I love that I can minimize the TapTap app and return to the game still streaming. Progress is not yet saved between streaming sessions, so it’s clearly just for testing purposes. Overall, it's been an interesting experience, and while there are some kinks, the potential here is exciting. Definitely surpassed my expectations.\r\n## 🌩Specific Cloud Game Experience\r\nCD 2: Trap Master is a fully playable game on cloud with a native feel for point-and-click interactions, with minimal dependence on Latency because it’s not a very reactive game. However, there seems to be an issue as there is no way to input the player's name at the start of the run. Other than that, the game works flawlessly without minimal adjustment.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6654026) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "SpongeBob - The Cosmic Shake\r\n8.6\r\nAction\r\nArcade\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nLooks like the gap or timeline between PC and mobile ports of AAA games is narrowing, as we now have another release on our hands with SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, a 3D platformer game now available not only for iOS but also for Android. Will this be another impressive port or maybe somewhat of a disappointment? We’ll find out soon enough.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Beautiful and Amazing level design\r\n- Fun and engaging platforming aspects\r\n- Feels like a special episode from the animated series\r\n- The original voice actors, many of the soundtrack and soundbits are back\r\n- Touch controls are implemented well and it feels right at home as a mobile game## Cons\r\n-Felt like a downgrade from Battle for Bikini Bottom\r\n-Fetch quests can get repetitive\r\n-Minor performance and UI control issues\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game's premise takes SpongeBob on a journey to fix the chaos caused by an innocent magical mishap. The concept of wishworlds introduces alternate versions of Bikini Bottom, each with its unique twist from Wild West version of Bikini Bottom to Hollywood-esque environment, It's a decent mover for both the narrative and the gameplay, aligning with the recent trend of multiversal stories. Overall, it feels like a special episode from the animated series.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nImpressively, the visuals on the mobile port hold up well against their PC/console counterparts. The game retains its cartoonish charm and vivid art style, resembling the animated series closely but transformed from 2D to high fidelity 3D. Even on higher resolution settings, the graphics maintain their quality and indistinguishable from its PC/console counterparts. Sound wise, many of the soundtrack and soundbits are back and the original voice actors are returning as well.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nSpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a 3D platformer that reminded to the golden days of PS1 and PS2 era platforming. The gameplay is reminiscent of classics like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, with SpongeBob navigating platforms, avoiding obstacles, and collecting Jellies. The level design is a standout feature, offering a beautiful rendition of Bikini Bottom with engaging platforming elements and varying ways to traverse platform and obstacles.\r\n## 🕹Touch Controls\r\nThe touch controls are implemented very well in the game, and you wouldn’t think that it’s a port of a PC/Console game. Proper prompts appear on the screen, and the 3D platformer nature of the game is a good fit for mobile phones. This is unlike the last AAA mobile port that I reviewed in Resident Evil 4, which basically slapped a virtual xbox gamepad on top of the screen without any effort. However, there's a slight issue with dialogues, as the slightest mistouch can inadvertently skip minor cutscenes and dialogues. This minor inconvenience can catch players off guard especially when you’re in the zone tapping the screen during gameplay and then there’s a sudden cutscenes; the next thing you know, you’ve skipped the cutscene.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat system is straightforward, with SpongeBob utilizing a basic spinning main attack to dispatch enemies most of the time. There’s other attack types too like the ground pound or flying kick that adds variety to the moves and how you counter different enemy types. The addition of a dodge mechanic adds a modern touch, since its not present in classic platformers. While combat is generally enjoyable, some may find it a bit simplistic, and SpongeBob is generally an overpowered character throughout most of the game.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe progression system introduces more moves for SpongeBob as the game unfolds; as well as unlocking new alternative universes to explore and alternate SpongeBob characters to meet. You can also buy and unlock SpongeBob costumes to use, but for cosmetic purposes only. Compared to its predecessor, the lack of multiplayer co-op modes is still clearly a missed opportunity. The game could have benefitted from the addition of co-op features, similar to classics like the LEGO games or Shrek 2 on PS2, although it’s not as needed here in the mobile version.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe technical performance of the mobile port is a mixed bag. The game looks pristine, with impressive lighting that looks almost the same if not the same as its PC/console counterparts. However, there are occasional stutters and crashes, I’ve personally experienced it multiple times, especially when tinkering with the graphics settings while playing — there’s a 50/50 chance that it would crash.\r\nThere are no graphics settings aside from a 30/60 fps switch and a base preset of Low to Ultra, and with my iPhone 13, A Epic preset was recommend, in which i turned down to high to have more frame rates. There are quite some stutters even when paying at the lowest settings, but nothing really game breaking and its overall playable.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nSpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake delivers a fun and faithful 3D platformer experience on mobile devices. The touch controls, despite minor quirks, make the transition from PC/console seamless. The game successfully captures the essence of the animated series, with original voice actors and nostalgic sound bits. The price is very affordable at $10 in what was originally $40 for PC/consoles, and it’s a hell of a deal, considering you can take the game on the go.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6698734) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Mobile Suit Baba\r\nAction\r\nStrategy\r\nPC Version\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nMobile Suit Baba is turn-based strategy/puzzle game, combining the charm of Baba Is You (from the same creator Hempuli) with the inspiration drawn from Subset Games' Into the Breach. This fusion results in a unique gaming experience that challenges players with intricate logic puzzles the encourages, no, requires players to break the rules of the game. The game is currently available for free on Itch.io, with an upcoming price of $4 after December 27. And no, this game is not related to Gundam.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Creative fusion of Strategy and Puzzle game mechanics\r\n- Elaborate puzzle/level design and mission/character variety\r\n- Clever use of words and ‘programming’ to alter the rules of the game\r\n- Free to claim until December 27, and then after at a cheap price of $4## Cons\r\n-Can be brutally challenging, missions can be difficult to solve\r\n-Can be quite repetitive since it will require a lot of restarts and do-overs\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nMobile Suit Baba is set in a futuristic idyllic world where society has improved greatly upon the invention of the “Quantum Fruit Stockpiling Technology” , Massive animal looking robots have been developed to handle these stockpiling operations and its defense. However, a mysterious force aims to steal all the fruit.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nMobile Suit Baba adopts a minimalistic and super retro visual style featuring anthropomorphic characters and complemented by an 8-bit soundtrack. The graphics may be simple, but the gameplay is definitely modern in its idea and mechanics, combining grid-based strategy with clever wordplay and programming mechanics. It offers a nostalgic yet an intellectually stimulating experience.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nAt its core, Mobile Suit Baba is a puzzle game disguised as a grid-based strategy title. The game introduces clever use of words and ‘programming’, allowing players to alter the rules of the game dynamically.\r\nThe game starts off relatively mild, just “visit” all the cities on the map, meaning moving on the city tiles at least once; and then it ups the objectives and introduces more elements as you complete more missions. Fruits to protect and avoid stepping on, Enemy Skulls and Robots to defeat, Hills to destroy, Rivers to cross, and more. And the solution isn’t as straightforward as you think like in a typical video game. Here, the rules are deliberately made to be broken. The objectives in each mission become progressively challenging, requiring players to think strategically and manipulate the environment to satisfy mission criteria.\r\n## 🌍Missions\r\nThe objective is clear: foil the plans of the fruit-stealing force through 43 missions filled with tactical challenges, presenting players with a variety of objectives to accomplish within a set turn limit.  The complexity of the missions lies in the deliberate breaking of rules, forcing players to think outside the conventional gaming norms.\r\nWithin each level, the rules manifest as literal word tiles on the map, in which you can either move them or destroy them. Through manipulation, players can alter these rules, reshaping the level dynamics and giving rise to some intriguing interactions. For example. “Water is Sink” means travelling on water is impossible and any units that will attempt will sink. “Fruit is Weak” means the Fruit will get destroyed the moment you step on it. Pushing the “Water” word out breaks the sentence and thus changes the rules, which now makes Water traversable. Breaking the sentence will invalidate the rule and change the situation, and you can even form new sentences and see the results.\r\nWithout breaking the rules, some of the objectives will seem impossible. For example, there was a mission where I had to defeat a lot of Skulls, only one of my unit was actually capable of killing them, and it isn’t enough for the default 5 turn limit of the mission. I had to push the word “Defeat” and the word “is” across the map and together with “Fire”, form the sentence “Fire is Defeat” in order to turn all the Fire tiles into something that can kill the Skulls, and I proceeded to push every Skull into the fire tiles to satisfy all the objectives before the turn limit ended.\r\nThere are various units and characters available for missions, each possessing distinct speeds and abilities that players can utilize. Some units can dash forward across the map, others can push units over long distances, some can throw units on an arc to bypass obstacles, and some can outright destroy both units and blocks. Each unit introduces a unique approach to tackling missions and objectives. Having said that; It’s quite a small game that matches its asking price, the missions are all there is to the game.\r\n## ⏫Difficulty\r\nThe missions provide a truly brain-teasing experience; very difficult and challenging and not everyone will appreciate this. However, there missions are by no means impossible. Completing them WILL require numerous restarts and undos, at least in my experience. Fortunately, one silver lining is that the game is quite forgiving, offering players ample opportunities for do-overs.\r\nYou can easily restart the entire turn if you make a mistake or undo a single move at a time. If all else fails, restarting the entire mission is just as straightforward — although it can be quite repetitive when it comes to it. Additionally, for particularly challenging scenarios, you have the option to decrease the difficulty by extending the turn limit with a  + 1 or  +3 option; although I found it does actually increases the difficulty in Fruit Survival missions, where you have to stop the enemies from destroying the Fruits because it gives you a longer timer that you need to survive.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThere’s not much to talk about, as the game is just 20MB it can basically run on anything. However one gripe I had is that there was no way to change the resolution of the game. Playing in Window mode will result in to a very small window with no way to adjust.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nAs a free-to-claim title until December 27 on Itch.io, Mobile Suit Baba is a delightful early holiday gift that is surely worth a play to any Into The Breach or Baba Is You fans out there. Even if you happen to miss the deal and are already reading this review post Dec 27, the $4 price is almost like a gift in itself still. If you love brain-teasing puzzle strategy games, thinking out of the box, and don’t mind the minimalistic retro visuals, then you’ll sure love Mobile Suit Baba, a game where the rules are made to be broken.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6712120) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Recently, I had the opportunity to play a bit of the Driftopia Beta Test, a survival crafting game set on an alien ocean planet, waiting to be explored and discovered. Driftopia, though still in beta on Android, attempts to merge the best elements of oceanic survival games.",

    "body": "Driftopia\r\n8.0\r\nAdventure\r\nCrafting\r\nPre-register\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nRecently, I had the opportunity to play a bit of the Driftopia Beta Test, a survival crafting game set on an alien ocean planet, waiting to be explored and discovered. Driftopia, though still in beta on Android, attempts to merge the best elements of oceanic survival games.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nDriftopia involve players being part of an expedition to explore alien worlds and habitable planets. As a passenger on the “Great Yu Starship”, complications during atmospheric entry lead to a crash landing on an alien ocean planet. The group becomes scattered, and supplies are spread across the vast ocean-laden world. Players must navigate the challenges of this new environment, repairing their starting Raft's main engine, and embark on a journey of survival, exploration, and discovery.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe graphics are decent—nothing too fancy for a mobile survival crafting game. However, the art direction is fantastic. I love the design of the world and the backdrop of the gas giant in the background. Outer Space is simply beautiful and the game made sure to showcase that. The sound design though is noticeably lacking for now, and the game is often dead silent at times.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nDriftopia introduces a gameplay dynamic that merges the sea exploration of Raft with the depths of survival crafting seen in Subnautica. The core experience centers on exploring the ocean, visiting islands and wrecks, and salvaging floating scraps. There is a fun fishing mechanic that allows you to fish for scraps with a rope and drag them to you, no need to swim. The game is co-op/online, although 100% of my experience has been solo and I haven’t encountered any players actually in this test.\r\nStarting my playthrough is the Character Creation which is still Barebones, only Females are allowed for now. After a brief introduction, I was left to my own devices with the main task of repairing the engine on my starting Raft. No tutorial was in place yet, so I had to figure out the mechanics on my own. Fortunately, it all seemed familiar, following the typical formula of survival crafting games. The enjoyment lies in traveling by sea, discovering an island, looting it, and then moving on to the next island or wreckage.\r\nOn land, the game follows the typical survival crafting formula, where you gather resources like wood, scrap, and fruits to build and survive. Build workstations, platforms, improve your Raft, and gather food to eat. There are different tiers of structures, items, and appliances that you can progress and build. From basic rafts to advanced workstations, players are encouraged to continuously upgrade and expand their capabilities.\r\nAs of this current beta, looting and gathering materials take a bit too long for my tastes. Imagine spending 20 seconds gathering a single tree, and building a simple workstation taking 30 or more seconds. Like most aspects of the game, the controls are a bit barebones. There’s no way to customize them, the left stick is place a little too high, and movement is clunky.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nPerformance-wise, it is absolutely horrible for my Snapdragon 888 device (ROG Phone). It started decently, but the performance took a nosedive on the second map, making it almost unplayable. There was no way to tweak the graphics or even the controls, so I was stuck playing with something that I didn’t find particularly comfortable.\r\nDue to these technical issues, I could not play as much as I wanted. Overall, the setup is interesting, but in this beta testing phase, all the systems are very rudimentary—more like a proof of concept.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDriftopia, in its current beta form, presents an intriguing premise and a promising gameplay concept, drawing inspiration from successful titles in the ocean survival crafting genre and having a unique spin of its own. However, that’s all it is for now — a proof of concept — showcasing potential rather than an enjoyable gaming experience.  This game needs serious work to realize that potential upon its release.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6724223) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Wandering ArkUS\r\nStrategy\r\nPost-apocalyptic\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nThe Wandering Ark is a mobile strategy game that features a unique pinball-style combat system where heroes, drawn from popular mythologies like Odin, Chang’e, Hou Yi, and Tyr, collide in a 5v5 battle on a rectangular arena.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Brand new style of gameplay: Pinball combined with RPG?\r\n- Variety of game modes\r\n- Smooth and welcoming progression\r\n## Cons\r\n- Forgettable story\r\n- Inconsistent artwork and quality\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story casts players in the role of the captain of a massive mobile base called the \"Wandering Ark,\" which roams the post-apocalyptic wasteland, recruiting heroes, and battling monsters. Honestly, I don’t know how the gameplay went from the story’s post-apocalyptic battle of heroes and monsters to a pinball style of combat, but it is what it is.\r\nThe story is largely forgettable; it starts decently with voice-acted scenes and a manga-style illustrations for its cutscenes, but this production value largely dies down as you progress further in the story. The voice acting disappears, and the cutscenes adopts a visual novel style of text dialogues that you need to read.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe Wandering Ark features a blend of hand-drawn anime aesthetics for its cutscenes and a charming chibi pixel art style for its gameplay. The steampunk and wasteland styles create a unique atmosphere, enhanced by the variety of heroes drawn from both Chinese and Western mythologies.  While the character designs and animations contribute to the game's charm, some unevenness in the art quality and combat special effects could use improvement, especially when the game haphazardly transitions from chibi-like pixel art to hand drawn anime-style art work frequently.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay revolves around a 5v5 battle on a rectangular arena, where heroes engage in pinball-style combat. Players set trajectories for their units, launching them to bump into opponents for damage, bouncing around the walls like in billiards or pinball.\r\nIt’s an entirely new kind of gameplay for me, and again, I don’t know how the in-lore explanation explains this, but honestly, I don’t care since it's fun to bounce heroes around. The heroes spawn 1 by 1 after each turn, until all participants are crowding the arena. The match ends when one team gets completely eliminated.\r\nThe match concludes when one team eliminates the other. The game also features various modes, including Nuclear Garden, Dungeons, and Captain's Battle, each offering distinct gameplay experiences but all converging on the same Pinball style of combat.\r\nThe combat system surprised me with its strategic trajectory planning. Initially requiring manual input for optimal damage, the game eventually allows automatic fights after a certain level. The order of appearance of heroes and their differing skills can alter the battle situation, demanding different formations for diverse enemies.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nThe game follows a chapterized mainline structure for linear story progression, with additional features like the Nuclear Garden and Dungeons offering varied experiences.\r\nThe Nuclear Garden functions similarly to a Pokemon-like system, where you can hunt and cultivate a variety of monsters to add bonuses to your heroes. It’s a mini-game on its own that adds a nice little flavor.\r\nDungeons are basically the farming game mode of this game that allows you to play and venture deeper into the mines, earn rewards, and progress, entirely separate from the main missions.\r\nCaptain’s Battle, which is essentially a real-time PvP component with leaderboards, is a bit fairer than many PvP systems because the levels of all heroes are equalized to 240 for SSR and 180 for SR and below. It simplifies the balance a little bit, but there is still some slight pay-to-win element present. Since the mode is in real-time it requires matchmaking to find opponents, as opposed to asynchronous PvP where you just need to battle other players’ preset defense teams.\r\n## ⏫Progression and Monetization\r\nProgression comes in the form of upgrading your heroes’ level and/or acquiring new ones via the gacha system. Upgrading and progression felt smooth without the presence of energy or stamina elements, and the mechanics are easy to grasp and learn.\r\nThe game is free-to-play, but there are gacha microtransactions, as expected. The game is still a bit pay-to-win, but the free-to-play experience is enjoyable nonetheless and forgiving in my experience. I already obtained some decent heroes in my first few hours of play; upgrading and progression does not feel grindy. There are no energy/stamina elements, and PvP is mostly balanced for all players.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game's portrait interface is well-organized, featuring a main menu that is easily navigable and adopts a no-nonsense approach. The user interface is designed efficiently, allowing for intuitive navigation. The performance was also satisfactory on my Snapdragon 888 device, with a smooth and responsive gameplay. I have no qualms about the game’s technical performance, and I did not encounter any noticeable issues while playing.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI would have given The Wandering Ark an 8 if the story were actually interesting and presented very well. However, the fresh enjoyable gameplay, variety of game modes, and welcoming experience compensate for it. As it stands, it provides a fun and accessible experience for gacha players seeking an unconventional gameplay experience on mobile.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6775970) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Darza's Dominion\r\n7.4\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nDarza's Dominion is an MMO rogue-like game that originally released on mobile five years ago. It was subsequently shut down, brought to PC last year, and has now just relaunched on Android a few days ago with a complete rework of the game.\r\nI've seen a lot of rogue-like games come out in the past few years, as well as bullet-hell twin-stick shooters. However, most of them aim for a single-player experience, and if there's any multiplayer, it's usually just co-op. Now, this is the first time I've heard of Darza's Dominion , and I'm surprised to see this concept of a rogue-like twin sticker shooter being done in an MMO fashion. I’m a bit late to the party, but its nonetheless a good timing for me to try out the game since it had just a rework.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique blend of MMO, Rogue-Like and Bullet Hell twin-stick shooter elements\r\n- A simple but accessible and engaging experience\r\n- Straight forward non-complex combat system\r\n- Optimized performance\r\n- Welcoming tutorial experience## Cons\r\n-Simplicity might be limiting as an MMO experience\r\n-Classes lack real variety since the combat is limited\r\n-Can quickly feel repetitive over time\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\nDarza's Dominion is a unique pixel blend of rogue-like, twin stick shooter, and MMO elements, setting itself apart in a genre dominated by single-player experiences and cooperative multiplayer.\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nThe game throws players into the unforgiving Dominion, a land filled with dangerous creatures and challenging terrains. The objective is to fight for survival, strengthen your hero, gather allies, and take on the formidable challenges presented by Darza. There’s no set story for this, at least for the current version I’ve played, but the tutorials are pretty decent and well informative in guiding the players throughout the early parts of the game.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nDarza's Dominion features your typical pixel-based graphics on a top-down view, but with pretty cool lighting and vibrant colors, which, while not groundbreaking, serve their purpose effectively. The recent rework introduces a day and night system, lighting effects, and bloom, which modernizes the look a little bit.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nAs a twin-stick shooter, Darza's Dominion offers a straightforward yet challenging gameplay. Left stick to move, and right stick to shoot and aim in a 360 degree angle. You have one ability that is determined by your class, and that’s about it. You just have to survive and get stronger. If you die, your character resets.\r\nThe starting classes I was offered was Paladin, Assassin, Archer, and Mage, and I’ve tried all four. There are also other classes too like Berserker and Wyrm Rider. You’d think there will be a melee system seeing class archetypes of that style, but all classes actually does ranged damage, some only a bit longer than others. The aiming system has no aim-assist whatsoever, so hitting is harder that most games and may be considered unforgiving and can take some time to get used to. The game also currently lacks the ability to directly aim some abilities.\r\nAs part of the MMO experience, you’ll see other players in the world, with the option to interact with them, form guilds, and defeat epic bosses together. It’s not really a typical MMORPG game with all the features you would expect from a full pledged MMO, but it still fits the description as a massively multiplayer online experience, as the game supports up to 100+ players in a single instance.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat revolves around basic attacks, occasional ability use, and stat-based power. It’s fast-paced, exhilarating, and challenging. The simplicity of the combat system is both a strength and a weakness. While it makes the game accessible, it may lack the depth desired by seasoned MMORPG players. Straightforward non-complex combat system is good, but the focus on ranged combat deprives the player of any real variety and can quickly feel repetitive over time, even with the randomly generated dungeons.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nDarza's Dominion offers a progression system through looting for better gear, leveling up, and combining gems. The simplicity of the progression system caters well to a mobile-centric experience. Not too complicated. Players can upgrade their characters by gathering and consuming gems to permanently increase stats. The difficulty increases as you move north on the map, in which you will encounter stronger enemies and dungeons.\r\nThe recent rework introduces affixes, changing the dynamics of looting tiered and untiered items, potentially adding more depth to itemization and progression. The rework also introduces attainments, adding more goals for players to achieve and showcasing their accomplishments in the leaderboards.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game follows a free-to-play model with microtransactions limited to premium currency (Gold), inventory slots, character slots, cosmetics, and pets. The recent rework introduces affixes and the soon to-be-ability to re-roll existing items. While microtransactions exist, they don't seem to hinder the overall gaming experience, as most of the real progress can be attained without the need for money.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nOn my Snapdragon 888, Darza's Dominion performed beautifully, and allowed me to maximize the graphics settings without encountering issues. However, the registration process is somewhat cumbersome, lacking the convenience of sign-in through popular platforms like Google Play or Facebook so I had to register manually inside the game. Not a big deal though.Some gripes that I would add though: is the lack of an option to resize the chat text size, as it tends to block the view when the messages are long; as well as the inventory system being a bit clunky to interact with, especially when looting and changing gear.\r\n## 🚧Recent Rework and Updates Highlights — The developers have introduced several notable features in this recent rework, which are the following:\r\nSemreh and Attainments: A new endgame system with attainments and leaderboards.\r\nNew Player + General Experience Improvements: Introducing new dungeons, tutorials, and changes to the overall experience.\r\nFunctioning Guilds: A fully functional guild system for better collaboration and communication.\r\nAccount Customization: Titles and emotes offer players a chance to express themselves.\r\nDay and Night System: Adds immersion with time-dependent enemy spawns and encounters.\r\nUpdated UI: Improvements to UI elements for better information delivery and experience.\r\nSemreh and Attainments: A new endgame system with attainments and leaderboards.\r\nNew Player + General Experience Improvements: Introducing new dungeons, tutorials, and changes to the overall experience.\r\nFunctioning Guilds: A fully functional guild system for better collaboration and communication.\r\nAccount Customization: Titles and emotes offer players a chance to express themselves.\r\nDay and Night System: Adds immersion with time-dependent enemy spawns and encounters.\r\nUpdated UI: Improvements to UI elements for better information delivery and experience.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDarza's Dominion, with its recent rework and updates, reinvigorates itself as again as a fresh but familiar MMO rogue-like experience. The game provides a simple but accessible and engaging experience especially for mobile players. While the simplicity of some aspects and lack of real variety in combat may deter hardcore MMORPG enthusiasts, especially those who are eyeing the PC version; it’s still a solid title worth checking out, especially that it’s free-to-play.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6775178) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Molecano\r\n8.7\r\nWord\r\nPuzzle\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nMolecano is a mobile word puzzle game that takes players journey throughout food and volcanoes with Molene the mole. Developed by the creator of Dadish and Super Fowlst, the game offers a blend of scrabble/crossword and Wordscapes-style puzzles, requiring players to form words out of jumbled letters and connect the words together on the map.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A familiar and refreshing word puzzle game experience\r\n- Relaxing and chill art design and soundtrack\r\n- The puzzles are really engaging and challenging\r\n- Over 400 levels to complete\r\n## Cons\r\n- Can feel too complex and might not resonate well with the more casual puzzle players\r\n- Not much to do outside advancing through the levels\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nMolecano revolves around guiding Molene across volcanoes by constructing words as traversible bridges. The goal is to collect delicious food scattered across lava-laden levels. This premise is pretty much basic and doesn’t really make sense, but at least there’s one.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nMolecano features a vibrant and cartoonish art style that feels sleek, clean, and simple. The characters, including Molene, are simple but charmingly well-designed. The overall art appeal feels really polished and premium. But perhaps the highlight of the art direction is the soundtrack; as it features an wwesome relaxing jazz soundtrack thats above and beyond most casual puzzle mobile games. Honestly, you could just stop playing and just listen to it and still chill and relax.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay in Molecano offers an interesting fusion of scrabble-style puzzles and Wordscapes, creating a dynamic and interactive experience. Players must string words together to help Molene traverse obstacles and reach the coveted food items. What sets Molecano apart is not just the challenge of forming words but the strategic aspect of choosing the right words to unlock paths to snacks. And just like scrabble, these words must have an an overlapping letter in order to connect, and all connecting letters must form a valid world.\r\nThe game's mechanics provide an interesting twist on popular puzzle games. It's not just about finding all possible words but figuring out which ones will lead to the snacks, and you’re only given up to 6 words to generate to complete the objectives and retrieve all the food. You can earn coins by forming 5 or 6 letter words, which allows you to unlock other characters.\r\nOverall, the puzzles are really engaging, challenging, and will feel familiar and refreshing at the same time. It’s only a singleplayer experience, but you’ll easily find yourself cooperating with your friends and families to solve puzzles together.\r\nHowever, the combination of both Wordscapes and Scrabble-style puzzles really amps up the difficulty and complexity and it might not resonate well with the more casual puzzle players (like our typical aunts and uncles) looking for something simple to pass the time.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nMolecano offers a substantial 400 levels with the promise of more to come, providing a vast amount of content for players to explore. The progression, however, is somewhat linear, primarily focused on advancing through levels. There’s not much to do aside from that; Challenges, objectives, or a star-rating system would have given some layer of depth to the levels. Indeed there are characters to unlock, but they are just cosmetic changes and doesn’t affect the gameplay in anyway.\r\nAnd even then, unlocking these characters costs a bit too much for my linking, and you'll most likely not unlock one until you've finished 30 or so levels. Having to grind for them doesn't make any sense since there is no way to use real money to unlock these characters anyway.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game is free-to-play but with occasional ads every time you reset the level, use a hint, or advance. Although there is a cheap one-time fee to fully remove the ads. As said earlier, there are characters to unlock, but it’s not part of the in-app purchases and can only be bought with in-game coins acquired through play.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing players to navigate through levels and manage in-game features without any hassle. As I said before, the game feels really polished and premium, even in its user interface. Overall, my experience has been smooth and responsive.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nMolecano stands out as a solid choice for those seeking a challenging yet laid-back mobile puzzle game. The game introduces a familiar and yet refreshing take on word puzzles, combining well popular elements with its own unique spin. The game's visual appeal, accompanied by a delightful jazz soundtrack, creates a relaxing atmosphere. For anyone that is looking to play Wordscapes or Scrabble-type games on mobile, I’d highly recommend checking this title out.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6787531) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Arcadium - Space Odyssey\r\n7.8\r\nAction\r\nAction Roguelike\r\nTest\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nArcadium - Space Odyssey is a survival roguelite shooter set in a procedurally generated universe, featuring pixel art retro visuals and space/planet exploration elements. It is set to release on Android, iOS, and coming soon on Steam, with an Open Beta currently available on Android with full features, and a demo version available on Steam.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game lacks a detailed story, and focuses more on gameplay than an intricate narrative, its premise revolves around survival in a procedurally generated universe. Players battle relentless alien hordes, strategically enhance their builds, and explore space to harvest planetary resources.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nArcadium adopts a pixel art retro visual style, with space-themed environments, colorful alien designs, and cool visual effects. The pixel art graphics create a charming and cohesive aesthetic that complements the overall theme. The low-fi retro-like soundtrack complements the outer space theme too while capturing the energetic spirit of space shooters during combat. The sound effects have a rhythmic beat, like a rhythm-based game.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game is essentially a single-stick shooter; you steer the direction of the spaceship, and it will automatically fire its weapons. There is supposed to be a twin-stick shooter option for manual aiming, but it is currently locked in the version that I played. There are up to four abilities to activate, two starting, and then up to two more via upgrades during runs. It’s entirely playable with one hand, although with how the ability buttons are placed, you might want to play it with two to ensure you can effectively activate your abilities while moving.\r\n## 🕹Rogue-lite\r\nThere are six levels, and except for the last “Endless” map, all require that you survive at least 15 minutes to clear them. There are no other objectives but to survive. As a rogue-lite, when you die, you need to restart the whole 15-minute run. Rogue-lite elements come from a randomized choice of three upgrades whenever you level up during runs, ranging from additional projectiles to defense mechanisms to entirely new activated abilities. There are also random shops and interactibles scattered across the procedurally generated maps for a chance to gain more rewards aside from the usual level-up.\r\n## 🌍Planetary Exploration\r\nArcadium adds its twist to the space rogue-lite shooter by incorporating planetary exploration elements; that is, you can land on planets and extract their resources, leading to more gold and EXP. The actual mechanism is rather simple; you just need to get close to the land and let its gravity “land” your ship to it, and after a certain amount of uninterrupted time, you start the extraction. It’s not very deep, but it’s a nice added gameplay layer that is slightly removed from the twitchy bullet-hell nature of rogue-lite shooters.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nPersistent progress comes in the form of unlocking new ships and expanding your roster of starting upgrades, all unlocked by completing challenges and milestones like destroying 1000 ships or extracting 50 planets. The roster of 10 ships themselves come with different starting abilities, with my personal favorite being the Minerva with its Pocket Black Hole ability, featuring jaw-dropping distorted Black Hole visual effects.\r\nAll in all, I found the game pretty easy, as I was mostly able to complete the levels in one or few tries, and there isn’t really much variety in the builds you can make. I almost always see the same upgrades over and over during the course of my playthrough, and I was basically bulldozing through the hordes of enemies even without really paying attention to both my build and my actual movement.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game ran smoothly, at a perfect 60fps, which is not surprising for a pixel art game, although I did encounter one game-breaking bug that locked the virtual joystick to one side. Easily fixable though by just minimizing the game and restoring it again.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game is free-to-play but with occasional unobtrusive ads that appear very rarely. There is a cheap one-time fee to fully remove the ads, although with how rarely it appears, I don’t really see much reason to, except for supporting the developers. Please do note that the game is still in Open Beta and it’s probably not finalized.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe addition of planetary exploration/harvesting sets Arcadium - Space Odyssey apart from traditional rogue-lite space shooters, offering players a chance to strategize and gain resources between intense waves of enemies; however, it falls short in delivering a truly challenging and varied rogue-lite experience, at least in this current Open Beta version. I do believe it’s still worth a try though.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6795274) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "7.2\r\nAction\r\nMultiplayer\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\n## Pros\r\n- Focus on both PvE and PvE\r\n- Interesting rogue-lite ideas\r\n- Cross-Platform Play\r\n## Cons\r\n- Clunky combat mechanics\r\n- No plot or story elements\r\n- Challenging progression rates (grindy)\r\n- Technical issues such as aspect ratio and performance\r\n## ⭐️Score: 4/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game is set in a world where virtual reality and gaming have triumphed, and we are put in the shoes of a character who has recently booted up and entered the world of Wonderers. There's not much plot featured in the game, and 99% of it is pure gameplay, and all about choices. Even at the beginning, the game introduces players to a choice right from the start, allowing them to opt for either PvP or PvE gameplay.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe game features chibi-style characters and soft cel-shaded graphics with HD visuals, offers a lively and vibrant presentation. The game exudes full-sized anime-style charm during dialogue panels, but these moments are only few and far between, and mostly seen during the start tutorial. . It also gives off a blocky and VR-like aesthetic in its level designs, as well as giving me Minecraft vibes with how the levels are laid out.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nDespite the game's release status, the combat and movement mechanics feel somewhat clunky, especially in the early stages. The slow and initially weak character can be a hindrance, but as you progress and enhance attack speed, the experience becomes more serviceable. Variety of weapon types are shared by characters, along with the ability to augment them using gold coins.\r\nHowever, the overall combat experience could benefit from further refinement to fully realize its potential, as the combat and movements feel clunky despite the game being released; it still feels like a game still in development. The auto-targeting system also sometimes works against the player, rather than for the player, resulting in some slightly annoying instances where you’d attack something you didn’t intend to.\r\n## 📜PvP mode\r\nThe PvP mode called Gold Clash is another distinct game mode and is the other half of the experience, far detached from the PvE experience. It involves a 4v4 team-based matchup with the same top-down ARPG combat, but now with an objective-based approach. Gold coins are scattered throughout the map, along with hazards and rewards, and it's up to your team to work together and achieve the main objective having the first player with 9999 points. When you eliminate players, their coins drop, providing you with the opportunity to steal their hard-earned coins and alter the course of the battles.\r\nHowever, the inherent fun concept in this game mode, as well as in the PvE mode are all somewhat hindered by the persisting clunkiness within the combat system. While the concept and objectives are engaging, the execution falls short of delivering a seamless and fluid experience.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game is free-to-play with microtransactions such as cosmetics, passes, and gacha rolls. All in all, I feel that the progression in terms of most of its rogue-lite elements is fair; however, everything else feels stingy. Unlocking new characters, obtaining free rolls, acquiring cosmetics, or simply upgrading artifacts—everything seems to be on the stingy side, making it challenging to play and progress comfortably on free-to-play terms.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game runs adequately on my Snapdragon 888 machine, but it's not a smooth experience; the frame rate is erratic, and anything less than a 100% resolution setting is a blurry experience. Additionally, the aspect ratio does not support and cover the entire screen of my phone.(2448x1080) So I had to play with grey bars on the sides.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWonderers offers a colorful and engaging ARPG idea with its strategic 4v4 PvP team-battles and rogue-lite dungeon crawling PvE mode. However despite its HD visuals, great focus on both PvP and PvE, and ambitious cross-platform accessibility, the game left me with a mixed bag of impressions with its clunky combat and stingy progression rates.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6801616) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Developed and provided by Tetrox Limited, it is currently in early access for Android users in the United States, although I was able to access it here on TapTap, even without the need for a VPN. The free-to-play game seems to be fully offline for now with online functionality and in-app purchases.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game invites players on a journey to rebuild the village of their childhood dreams. Set on an empty plot covered in trees and stones and populated by skilled NPCs from smiths, miners, and lumberjacks, Cozy Islands offers a lighthearted guided experience that combines crafting and building. There is literally no story but the premise sets the stage for a relaxing and fulfilling “Cozy” experience.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nCozy Islands – Craft & Build features vibrant, lighthearted visuals and a soundtrack complemented by cel-shaded, cartoonish graphics. The overall art design of the game feels truly professional and polished. Seeing a screenshot or gameplay video, I would not blame you if you mistook it for an actual farming game released for consoles like the Nintendo Switch.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nCozy Islands starts with gathering simple resources like picking up grass, cutting down trees for wood, and breaking down rocks for stone. The gameplay loop revolves around crafting more complex resources with the help of NPC villagers and their workshops —  ranging from Sawmills, Stonecutters, Looms, and Furnaces.\r\nAs players build more structures, new islands and areas unlock, providing access to additional resources and crafting options. The game is all about the satisfaction of building and cultivating your Islands and seeing houses and structures get built over time. Despite the simplicity of the gameplay, it can become surprisingly addictive.\r\n## ⚒️Building and Crafting\r\nBuilding is enjoyable as it takes you step by step through the construction of every detail, from foundations and walls to doors, windows, and even decorations. Building the structure is a multi-step process that takes time and requires patience to build. However, you cannot really design it yourself, the building is predetermined and set in stone.\r\nThe resources and items required in the game are logically connected to the building process. Gathering flowers for decoration, mining stones to build walls, and cutting wood into various variants for different sections of the house are some examples. It all contribute to a cohesive crafting experience that makes perfect sense. The whole game is a pretty guided experience; especially as a crafting and building game, it easily what resources are needed and where to craft it, and even at times where to gather the resources. The mechanics allow players to express their creativity by renovating and building each house step by step, promising both engagement and reward.\r\nOne gripe I have, though, is with the resource gathering mechanics, as it requires manually multiple taps to keep gathering. A single hold function to keep gathering would have been better and have been less tedious to execute, especially since this is one of the core gameplay elements that you'll be engaging with for most of the time.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nCozy Islands is a pretty chill game with its premise, but underneath all that is a grindy experience that will force you into waiting in real-time for upgrades and for the limited resources in the environment to respawn. That or you’ll be pressured into spending money to get diamonds, and the costs are expensive. I was able to build the main house for around two hours of play, but in-between those sessions required long sessions of real-time waiting for the resources to respawn as the starting area’s resources to gather is pretty limited. And it gets even more demanding as you play with more structures to build and more complex resources to craft.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game runs smoothly even in this Early Access version, maintaining a frame rate of over 30FPS, although it is not without minor issues. Occasionally, the UI overlaps when navigating menus quickly, and there are instances where the game locks up, halting all movement and commands, requiring a full restart.  As an early access game, the game feels really far off in the development cycle and the game generally feels and looks very polished, even more than many released titles. The game seems to completely function in offline mode, so you don’t need online connection to play, at least in this early access version.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nCozy Islands – craft & build is a pretty cozy game that lives up to the name and provides a delightful crafting and building experience; and sense of guided accomplishment for players looking to rebuild a cozy village and its surrounding islands. Cozy Islands holds promise as a relaxing and cozily rewarding game, even showcasing a level of polish unusual for an early access title. However, further refinements and additions in its mechanics and balancing the grind for free-to-play users may further enhance its appeal.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6800349) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Devil May Cry: Peak of CombatGlobal\r\n7.8\r\nAction\r\nHack And Slash\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat is a mobile hack-and-slash ARPG game released globally on January 10, 2024, attempts to capture the essence of the renowned Devil May Cry franchise, but on-the-go, available for Android and iOS.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful to its hack and slash roots, gameplay wise\r\n- Streamlined controls for mobile\r\n- Seamless character switching added to its combo system\r\n- DMC4 like impressive visuals for a mobile game\r\n- Optimized performance## Cons\r\n-Fans of DMC may not appreciate the switch to the grindy gacha gaming formula\r\n-No Automatic Mode or Idle Mechanics\r\n-Forgettable narrative\r\n-Minor camera control issues\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat attempts to retell elements from Devil May Cry 3 and draws from various mainline games. The collaboration of iconic characters - Dante, Vergil, Lady, and Nero will be very familiar to fans of the series, although it’s not a strict requirement to have played any of the games. The game occupies a unique narrative space. Similar to the largely forgotten DmC: Devil May Cry, it exists within its own continuity while revisiting familiar grounds. Basically, just forget about the story of the other mainline games and just treat this as its own little pocket of alternate reality.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nGraphically, the game is impressive, it lands closer to the visual fidelity of Devil May Cry 4 than aiming for the more modern DMC5 visuals, although it sometimes looks that way in the character menus. Character models are actually impressive, not only in menus,and cutscenes but also in combat, and the atmospheric environments and rockstar soundtrack successfully capture the series' essence. As far as looks, they pretty much nailed it as a DMC game. The game incorporates full voice acting for pre-rendered cutscenes, capturing the atmospheric essence of the series. However, many in-game cutscenes lack voiced dialogue, I initially thought this was just a CBT thing, but even with the global release, it’s still the same way for the most part.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game features the classic hack-and-slash gameplay style that the series is known for, but with the addition of mobile game mechanics such as gacha systems, upgrading heroes, story chapter missions, grindy progression, and live service elements. The seamless character switching is probably its most unique feature mechanically — a current mobile ARPG staple adapted into DMC form, allowing players to switch between characters like Dante, Vergil, Lady, and Nero during combat.\r\nIn an ironic twist of events, on the mobile platform known for its idle game mechanics, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat doesn't have an Automatic Mode that was featured in the mainline series to make it accessible for more people. It's a shame because the gacha and farming-oriented progression system would have benefitted from idle mechanics.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe controls are responsive, enabling precise movement, powerful attacks, and stylish combos. You can dash, launch into the air, perform quick or powerful attacks, as well as one ability and ultimate ability. While the attack system is simplified for mobile — including Dante’s moveset which now incorporates both sword fighting and gunslinging into one moveset. it retains enough variety to create enjoyable and visually impressive combos, especially when the seamless character switching feature is used to combine characters.\r\nOverall, the combat system maintains its fast-paced, combo-driven nature. Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat introduces a rating system that grades player combos up to SSS, a familiar measure of stylishness. Despite these positive aspects, I wouldn't go as far as to say it has lived up to its rather demanding name, 'Peak of Combat.' It’s certainly not the pinnacle of the series. Targeting issues, especially against airborne units, and challenging camera control during combat detract from achieving the true apex of the series' combat experience.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nTo advance through the campaign, players must raise their overall rank by accumulating experience points from all sorts of activities; such as open-ended missions. This progression system intertwines with upgrading weapons, characters, and stats using materials garnered from missions.  However, I find the game too grindy as a free-to-play experience. There is just too much grinding to progress even in the early chapters, and it hurts the combat of the game due to how challenging the enemies become unless you grind more or spend money.\r\nThere is a gacha system that allows players to roll for character cosmetics, weapon skins, and coveted legendary movesets. Since the characters are very limited and DMC doesn’t have a bajillion characters in its roster, we instead get different variants of the four characters.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat introduces a gacha system and incorporates a live service element into its progression mechanics. While the gacha system adds an element of excitement and collectibility, it introduces a potential drawback — the game's reliance on grinding and the temptation to spend real money for desirable items. This may pose a challenge for its apparent target audience: fans accustomed to the traditional Devil May Cry progression. However, there is a more real target audience for this title, particularly DMC fans who are also okay with mobile gacha games.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWhile the game suffers from issues like targeting and camera control during combat, the optimization for has been improved alot since the testing days and my Snapdragon 888 device was able to run it on max settings without much slowdowns, with a target of 60fps. With how impressive the game looks, it’s a commendable feat to have it run the way it is on my phone.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDevil May Cry: Peak of Combat ushers the Devil May Cry franchise into the mobile gacha gaming space. It encapsulates the series' essence through faithful art design and dynamic combat, now with seamless character switching. However, the experience is marred by its rather forgettable narrative, combat control issues, and the grind-heavy progression system. As a DMC-themed mobile gacha game, it earns a 6/10 from me.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6808092) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Magic Chronicle: Isekai RPG\r\n5.4\r\nAdventure\r\nRPG\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nMagic Chronicle: Isekai RPG is a mobile gacha game set in a fantasy world called Taelan Land, featuring chibi characters and an auto-battler experience where players to assemble a team of up to five heroes and engage in battles against demons.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Well done visuals and character design\r\n- Various game modes\r\n- Accessiblity and quality of life features\r\n- Generous progression rates\r\n## Cons\r\n- Not much depth in the combat\r\n- Features that are locked behind paywalls and VIP subscriptions\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nMagic Chronicle: Isekai RPG thrusts players into a world plagued by demonic forces, as the Taelan Land faces an invasion from outer space. The demons, fueled by a wicked crystal, launched a relentless onslaught that was ultimately thwarted by the Taelan guardians and the shards were separated, guarded by different races.The peace is short-lived as the shards awaken, plunging the land into chaos once more.\r\nThe title is as generic as it gets, and it features a plot that may come across as somewhat intriguing but cliché. It feels like an introduction to a cookie-cutter Anime premise, but it's just there as a backdrop and doesn't interrupt the game, which is laser-focused on the battles.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe game features chibi cel-shaded graphics that might look like 2D initially but are actually in 3D. These graphics are combined with anime-style artwork to represent the characters in menus. Impressive visual effects accompany the skills and various animations, all well-executed. Honestly, I appreciate the art design and general vibe; even the chibi designs are well done.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay follows an auto-battler style, where you set a roster of up to five heroes and let them battle automatically enemies. There’s not much depth to it and the outcome is mostly determined by the overall team level, although hero composition plays a small role. While the manual activation of hero special abilities is an option in solo missions, it provides only a false sense of control, as the battles are designed to be automated. Overall, battles are fast-paced, lasting only a few seconds to a minute at most, but just like the combat, progression largely hinges on character levels.\r\nWith a ridiculously large amount of chapters and levels to complete, the game offers generous progression elements, making it a compelling option for free-to-play players. However, it is not without its share of enticing microtransactions, which I will discuss later.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game is lenient in terms of progression, gradually easing players to the mechanics before encountering any kind of progression wall. You can easily clear the first many levels even without touching your characters levels or gacha summons, and when you do, there’s plenty of resources to come by.\r\nFor powerful characters, there's the option to utilize the 'bulldoze' feature, skipping levels up to the next boss challenge. I’ve jumped more than 10 levels using this feature. However, this might lead to hitting a progression wall sooner than later.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nVarious features are accessible to both free-to-play and paying players, such as the bulldoze feature, AFK resource gathering, and a 'fate oracle' that only requires leveling up five main heroes, with the rest adjusting to the lowest level. Other features include a reset option to bring back unused heroes to level 1 and regain used materials, or a totally idle/automated 'auto-skip to the next level,' available as a paid feature.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nAs a gacha game, Magic Chronicle incorporates typical elements with side game modes like tower progression, challenges, guilds, and PvP. Other game modes beyond battles include a rogue-lite style board game and an exploration mode set in a grid-like strategic map filled with various encounters. The game offers a plethora of systems to keep players engaged and invested, and the gameplay is genuinely enticing.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, many features are locked behind paywalls and VIP subscriptions, including auto stage clearance in towers, additional premium rewards, and more PvP encounters. Fortunately, there isn't a stamina system for completing missions.\r\n## ⚔️PvP\r\nThe PvP is asynchronous, requiring players to build up their defense lineup and attack others' defense lineups. It follows a straightforward system used in many games. Participating in PvP costs tickets, which require premium currency. While there are indeed pay-to-win elements, their significance is likely only apparent to those deeply invested in the PvP experience.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game run decently and I didn’t even have to tinker with any settings and jumped straight into gameplay. I did not come across any game breaking bugs aside from server connectivity problems. The game strongly advises you to bind your account to theirs, as you could easily lose your progression. I had a small scare because I mistakenly connected to the Asia server, and had my progress was reset. However, upon connecting back to the US server, I got everything back. One minor gripe, though, is that during combat, characters will sometimes stay far beyond the edges of the screen, and you cannot see all the action, which is limiting as it is in this vertical orientation.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe gameplay, primarily an auto-battler, successfully provides a fast-paced and entertaining dynamic. With a very lenient progression and diverse features such as the 'bulldoze' option and various game modes outside combat, that caters to both free-to-play and paying players. Despite its super generic title and looks, Magic Chronicle: Isekai RPG manages to present a visually pleasing and recently engaging mobile gacha experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6808406) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "title": "Starting the new year with a great indie banger | Review - Momodora: Moonlit Farewell",
    "description": "Momodora: Moonlit Farewell is the latest installment in the Momodora game series. After an almost a decade of absence, Momodora is finally back. It offers a blend of Metroidvania and 2D Souls-like gameplay wrapped in a retro pixel art style. Set in the village of Koho, the game follows the High Priestess Momo Reinol as she embarks on a divine mission to save her people from a demonic invasion unleashed by a malevolent bellringer.",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\n## Pros\r\n- Beautiful pixel art design and soundtrack\r\n- Rich world and lore\r\n- A mix of metroidvania and souls-like but without all the hardcore difficulty\r\n- Great level design\r\n- Sigil passives that allows for experimentation and build diversity\r\n## Cons\r\n- Not a lot of character progression/customization elements aside from Sigils\r\n- Lacking regular enemy variety\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game is basically the fifth Momodora game, following the prequel game Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight last 2016 and the first three Momodora games released around ten years ago. Honestly, I havent played any of the other games but this one seemed standalone enough and playing it, I still had a great experience.\r\nThe story is set five years after the events of Momodora III, plunging players into the midst of a demonic invasion triggered by an ominous bell toll. The village of Koho is in peril, and Momo Reinol is tasked by the matriarch to investigate and eliminate the bellringer responsible. Pretty much a standard plot that serves to move the story and compels the player to explore with a sense of urgency and purpose.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nI’ve had great impressions with the art style plus a great soundtrack. The art style adopts a pixel art design with really good effects and well-crated animations. The soundtrack has some retro moments with some 8-bit sound bites, but the actual background music quality is not limited to it and is high fidelity. It is amazingly melodramatic and soothing.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game plays like a mix of Metroidvania and Souls-like games: platforming to navigate the levels, jumping around, climbing, with a little bit of falling with style. Then, Souls-like by way of discovering Bells that restore your health and magic points and act as checkpoints. Every time you enter and re-enter a level, all enemies are reset. Every time you die, you restore back to the last Bell you rang.\r\nThere are lots of interactables give you a little bit of liveliness in the world, talking to every NPC, gathering artifacts, and activating mechanisms. It's the little details that make all the difference, and the world is rich in lore. If you're someone who hasn't played any of the Momodora games, it does a great job of exposing the player to the rich world of Momodora for the first time.\r\n## ⚔️Combat and Movement\r\nThe combat is very simple; there are only two sets of attacks across the entirety of the game, one melee and one ranged. Range is a basic ranged bow attack, and melee is a three-hit combo with a ranged boomerang at the end. It’s just two weapons throughout the game, but their behavior can be slightly modified and altered in terms of ‘Sigils’, which work as equippable passives that are crafted or discovered in the world.\r\nMovement is a little bit slow at first, and there are some points of annoyance early on, such as the collectible lunar crystals scattering around when enemies die, which can make gathering them a bit tiresome and tedious sometimes, to the point that I just ignore them.\r\n## 📜 Progression and Passive Sigils\r\nEventually, you get to unlock new moves and Sigils to improve your character in all sorts of different ways. From a simple damage stat increase and additional projectiles to new moves such as spriting, double jump, and auto-collection of lunar crystals. In my experience, the game exponentially gets better over time. All these minor annoyances slowly disappear one by one.\r\nAside from collecting sigils, you also get to collect fruits and flowers to gain more health and magic points, adding a bit of exploration element while playing. In fact, you can get stronger faster in this game via exploration, rather than killing all the mobs and gathering lunar crystals.\r\n## 🌍Level Design and Enemies\r\nI love the level design. It’s not spoon-feeding the player with obnoxious quest markers and linearity and leaves just enough information via the map system to know where you need to go next. Some areas will be initially out of reach but will eventually be traversable once you've unlocked the necessary moves like a double jump or the ability to destroy enchanted barriers. The game encourages the player to explore every nook and cranny, and it may lead to more rewards; such as more plants to consume and more sigils to select from.\r\nThere are a lot of mini-bosses and bosses scattered throughout the levels, and I love how they don't totally follow the format of level then boss fight at the end. It feels like you're stumbling upon them more often than not, instead of having it feel like it's a finale that’s capping off a level. I found the bosses relatively easy to defeat, and their moves are easy to remember, so as far as difficulty goes, it’s not really aiming for that hardcore Metroidvania feel. Despite having said that, they’re all fun and varied.\r\nRegular enemy variety is a bit lacking, with a set of distinct enemy types for every biome you enter, and even then, they don't really pose any mechanical challenge and can easily be defeated or outmaneuvered, especially once you’ve unlock a lot of mobility; you can easily just run past them and they don't really offer much in terms of upgrading your character’s powers to warrant your time.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nSince the game is in a retro pixel art style, hardware requirements are a non-issue. I also encountered zero bugs or crashes while playing the game. The game is playable on both keyboards and controllers. There is full controller support, but the default keyboard controls are a bit unorthodox for me. Luckily, you can rebind the controls so it’s really not a problem on both input methods.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nOverall, Momodora: Moonlit Farewell is a solid experience for what seems like 6-8 hours of gameplay to finish the story. It does not overstay its welcome and is a consistent ride throughout that keeps players engaged with constant new elements and offering a well-crafted blend of rich story, pixel art visuals, and metroidvania souls-like gameplay.\r\nIt's like The Witcher 3 or Baldur’s Gate 3 situation all over again: not a lot have played the predecessor games, but this most recent one is an absolute standalone banger that it's generally fine to skip everything else and jump straight to this one.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6823124) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nSurvivors Of The Zombie World is a top down zombie survival shooter made for mobile (Android and iOS), and is officially available on TapTap. With its recent release a few days ago, the game plunges players into a post apocalyptic blocky Minecraft-ish world teeming with the undead. And yeah, don’t mind the typo 'Surivor', it’s actually there in-game.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Simple visuals but really good lighting system that affects gameplay\r\n- Shooting zombies feels and sounds good\r\n- Diverse gameplay modes (missions, survival, and tower defense)\r\n- Local Multiplayer mode (Wi-fi and hotspot)\r\n- Free-to-play friendly\r\n## Cons\r\n- Control quirks and targeting issues\r\n- Game breaking bugs\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game is set in a post apocalyptic zombie infested world, and that’s about it for the premise. Despite the presence of a \"Story\" mode there’s no actual story or plot in this game, it primarily serves as a framework for a linear series of missions with diverse objectives. This game mostly focus on gameplay rather than providing an actual story for players to engage with.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nSurvivors of the Zombie World features a distinctive blocky, simple Minecraft-inspired visual style, complemented by a impressive lighting system that significantly influences gameplay. The lighting system plays a crucial role, especially during the night when visibility can plunge into pitch darkness. Overall the art style is nothing we've seen before, but it's decent enough for what it tries to do. The soundtrack is pretty decent, some eerie ambient sound for the zombie apocalypse vibe, as well as brutal sounding gunshots and explosions.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nSurvivors of the Zombie World is basically a top down shooter at its core. Although, playing it, it gave me a bit of a classic Resident Evil vibe with how the footsteps sounds and the movement/shooting works. Fortunately, the controls are more of a twin-stick shooter type rather than Tank-type controls. Left stick to move, and right stick to fire. Some weapons like pistols automatically aim, some weapons like shotguns will need manual aiming. The controls aren’t perfect and the auto-aiming feels clunky and does not hit low target very well at point blank range. There are cases where I wished I could toggle manual aim.\r\nThe lighting system plays a crucial role, especially with the day/night cycle. At night, players must navigate the challenging nighttime terrain using flashlights, requiring a strategic use of limited battery resources. The gunshot sound are very immersive and I love how you could spam the pistol with a very high fire rate that makes me feel like I’m John Wick killing hordes of zombie while playing.\r\nPlayers can sprint, use grenades, activate flashlights, and consume items such for healing, stamina, and food as the player can also go hungry over time and sprinting consumes stamina which takes long regenerate. There is a lot of element here in a bite sized form factor, and they all form a nice core gameplay of the game across three distinct but similar game modes.  There are many zombie variants with their own unique characteristics, some move very fast, some spit webs that block your view temporarily, some explode upon death, some slows movement down.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nSurvivors of the Zombie World offers multiple modes, including a story mode, survival mode, defense mode, and wifi/hotspot multiplayer mode for cooperative play (survival and defense mode only). The primary objective is to endure the post-apocalyptic setting by scavenging for supplies and resisting waves of zombies. The game also supports offline play, perfect for playing the game on-the-go in bite sized sessions, with or without internet.\r\nStory mode is a linear set of missions that you'd have to complete with varying objectives from eliminating zombies, surviving for a period of time, getting from one point to another, to recovering supply crates. As said earlier, it’s not really a story mode.  They get increasingly harder in general, but there are random easy or hard difficulty spikes as you progress further into the missions.\r\nSurvival Mode basically unlocks the whole map-type (biome) and spawns the player in an open world-type of unending survival. Survive as long as you can, roam around the map and pick up random supply drops to keep surviving. Manage your resources, and reap the rewards.\r\nDefense mode is also a never ending mode but the focus is defending your base where enemies come in waves. Here we have tower defense elements because you have three electric towers that you’d need to manage and repair. It’s not very deep and ultimately it all boils down to surviving, managing resources, and collecting supplies inside your base once again.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nAside from advancing in the Story mode, further progression lies in unlocking new characters and weapons by way of Gold (rewarded from play) or Diamond (Premium Currency but also rewarded from playing). Players can also upgrade weapons too, increasing their stats and capacity. You can also purchase consumables on vending machines while on missions is possible, but at a very costly rate. There are characters/weapons that can be unlocked with Gold only, and others with Diamond. Some are unlocked via quests and challenges, such as killing a specific type of zombie 50 times.\r\nThe game is pretty much free-to-play friendly, as there isn’t anything limiting you really from playing Survival and Defense mode endlessly, but there are benefits to spending money as well. If you want to push further — More missions to complete, longer days and enemy waves to survive; then you’d have to either farm for Gold or spend cash. The game, being this bite-sized, can only take you so far before it becomes repetitive, although I wouldn’t go as far as say that this game is outright repetitive.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game ran fine on my device (Snapdragon 888 phone), I’ve had no bugs and issues aside from the aforementioned target and combat quirks; and the performance has been generally good without any frame rate drops or stutters. However some players have reported to have been experiencing issues, mainly the widespread ‘floating gun’ bug, I do hope the developers can fix this issue for these players.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nSurvivors of the Zombie World is a good looking, bite-sized zombie shooter suitable for on-the-go sessions, both online and offline. Despite the control quirks, the game succeeds in delivering an engaging, action-packed experience to pass the time, perhaps doing it very well that it's not quite as 'bite-sized' anymore at times. There are current issues for some players, or maybe most players, and I do hope it gets fixed ASAP.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6827502) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Yohane the Parhelion - NUMAZU in the MIRAGE -\r\n7.7\r\nRoguelike\r\nAnime\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nYohane the Parhelion - NUMAZU in the MIRAGE is a deck-building roguelike game set in the Love Live! Sunshine! universe. The game is set to release on PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC via Steam on February 22, with a free demo now out for everyone to try. The demo includes the first chapter that lasts around 20-30 minutes per run and culminates in a final boss battle. Progression is not saved, but as this is a rogue-like game, it’s a non-issue.\r\n## 📜History\r\nThe game is set in the Love Live! universe, a franchise known for its multimedia projects, anime series, and music; and has been a cultural phenomenon in Japan. \"Love Live! Sunshine!!\" is one of its successful media, which is about high school girls forming idol groups to save their schools. \"Yohane the Parhelion\" takes this beloved universe and transforms it into a fantasy setting, and this is what this game adapts and is all about.\r\n## 📖I have no idea about Love Live!, can I still play it?\r\nYes, checking out the demo, I really had no prior knowledge of Yohane the Parhelion or the Love Live! Sunshine Franchise. Despite the game primarily catering to existing fans, it turned out well for me as a first-time exposure because the experience is mainly gameplay-oriented and focused on the deck-building rogue-like aspect. Still, it’s probably a better experience if you had prior knowledge with the franchise and have watched the anime.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story begins when Yohane, a fortune teller girl in Numazu, comes into possession of an old mirror. Suddenly, she is sucked into the mirror, which transports her to the \"Reverse-Numazu\" – an exact reverse of the real Numazu. This mysterious world allows the use of magic through the power of cards, and this is where the rogue-like gameplay begins.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game combines elements of fantasy, magic, rogue-like gameplay, and strategic card battles. it is essentially a deck-building rogue-like where you choose your encounters, free to select your own path through a series of branching paths.\r\nPlayers travel across the map, encountering events such as stores to buy new cards, campsites to rest and upgrade cards, chests to loot, and random events with choices to play out. However, the primary focus is on combating different sets of enemies in a card battle layout, culminating in a final boss battle that concludes each chapter. There's not much varying of enemies in the demo, and I do hope there is a lot more in the later chapters in the full game.\r\n## ⚔️Card Battles\r\nThe actual card battle mechanics are simple yet very strategic with its attack and defense mechanic, involving attack and defense ratings for all cards/units that determine their attack power and the ability to mitigate damage.\r\nYou get to choose which new cards to add from a randomized selection every now and then, building up your deck, until it’s full that you need to discard to add new ones. The modifiers of the cards are varied and interesting, providing straightforward effects such as \"attacks all enemies,\" \"lowers attack rating,\" or \"adds 10 shields on the next turn.\"  Health points are persistent throughout runs and does not reset after encounter so you’d need to manage it throughout the runs.\r\nWe also get to see the enemy units’ next moves and it’s an interesting mechanic that gives us another strategic insight how to approach the battle — what cards to use and which units to attack. Overall, the combat is very strategic without being overly complicated, I was constantly thinking about next move instead of spamming attack cards aimlessly.\r\n## 🃏Charms and Summons\r\nApart from cards, the game includes charms serving as permanent passive elements with simple yet varied and interesting modifiers. Players can also summon friends as temporary allies during battles. Although the game is a rogue-like, it incorporates persistent elements, allowing players to unlock new modifiers and mechanics for subsequent runs, for example a one-time revive upon death to 20% HP.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nI found the first run very easy, with a tutorial section at the start and some story being told in between encounters, but there was a huge difficulty spike at the end boss which defeated me. Subsequent runs of the Demo are then have a more balanced difficulty and excluded the tutorials/story bits.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe game features vibrant visuals, well-animated characters, and somewhat detailed cel-shaded visuals. The soundtrack is an atypically adventurous and soothing anime music, but it sounds great nonetheless. There is a little bit of voice acting with partially voiced dialogue lines, and it's quite unfortunate not to have full acting, as it feels lacking considering everything else in the presentation is essentially done well.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nOverall the demo ran smoothly and no issues. With it’s lightweight nature most computer should run it well. Aside from its current platforms, I do hope it gets ported to mobile soon though, as this type of game really fits the mobile platform very well with its rogue-like nature and open-ended gameplay.\r\nThe game can be played with just the KB and supports controllers too, but the point-and-click controls for the mouse are implemented really good as well, it even snaps the cursor to appropriate locations when using it, although some people may find the feature confusing.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI went in pretty much with zero knowledge of Love Live!, but I came out of the demo pretty much excited about the upcoming game all the same. Yohane the Parhelion - NUMAZU in the MIRAGE captured my interest in the short amount of time I played the demo, with its engaging rogue-like mechanics, strategic card battles, and the overall appealing visuals and cute characters, and I'm glad to have tried it. It releases next month on February 22, 2024.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6831455) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game features a unique premise where two allied factions, Neoterrans and Wokens, engage in a war against a mysterious alien civilization, as players take on the role of powerful fighters tasked with becoming the ultimate Star Warrior.\r\nI previously reviewed Starstride's closed beta test last September 2023, and today, I have revisited the game on Mobile in preparation for its upcoming next closed beta test, which is coming real soon scheduled on January 20, 2024, to February 4, 2024. The test will be available on both Mobile (Android via TapTap) and PC platforms, featuring crossplay between them, although cross-progression is not available at the moment.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nStarstride's premise features an intriguing blend of high fantasy and futuristic sci-fi. The two allied factions, Neoterrans and Wokens, engage in a fierce battle against a mysterious alien civilization. As one of the remaining powerful fighters, players choose a faction and embark on a journey to become the ultimate Star Warrior. The campaign was initially only around 1 hour worth of gameplay last year, but it has now been expanded with more content for players to test.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe graphics are clean and crisp, and sometimes looks like something that came out of the PS2 or PS3 era.The character designs seems heavily inspired by the Phantasy Star Online series of games. Notably, there are significant texture and model pop-ins that are still left unresolved, with a very close draw distance. I can't deny though that some of the details are already gorgeous to look at. I do hope it’s just a matter of optimized the game further for mobile phones, as the game is also available for PC.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nStarstride's gameplay is basically a hack-and-slash ARPG with a open-world MMO functionality wherein you can travel across the vast land, visit a central city hub to interact with NPCs, and enter various dungeons to farm rewards. The game features many character archetypes and weapons to equip, all of which can be used on your character without the need to create new ones. Weapons come in many shapes and sizes; Sword, Dual Blades, Shield, Spear, Hammer, and even a Whip.\r\nThe game features a pretty intuitive questing and auto-pathing system where the character can easily sprint towards its next destination, albeit slightly comically due to how fast the character runs, and sometimes overshoots its pathing AI — which is still not fixed in this version. There are no idle game elements here though such as auto-combat or passive resource generation. I was only able to play solo, but there is an option for creating a party with other players to raid rifts together.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nStarstride showcases a potentially satisfying combat system with flashy action-packed animations and powerful feeling abilities, although as of current state, the gameplay still comes with semi-clunky controls, messy visual effects, and unstable performance. All weapons comes with a basic attack command as well as a bash ability, plus two abilities and a special flashy ‘QTE’ attack for regular enemies. Every weapon has their special attack animations, including the QTE attacks, although I would love some more variety as they could still get repetitive.\r\nMost of the enemies you face in this game consist of animals / monsters —both regular and massive—that you can hunt for materials and exp. Additionally, you encounter cyborg alien beings, as highlighted in the game’s introduction battle. During combat, there is a high level of visual clutter that can make it challenging to track the action, especially when trying to monitor enemy attacks for dodging. Successfully dodging grants you a temporary slow-motion boost, enabling you to unleash more attacks than usual.\r\n## ⏫Progression and eventual Monetization\r\nThe characters’ power armor and energy cores are the main centerfolds of the progression and character power. Upgrading them is the best way to get stronger. You have the freedom to create your own character (up to five on the same account), customize their appearance and gear, and choose their starting class.\r\nWith this test version, Starstride now includes additional tutorials and systems designed to introduce players to the mechanics. However, it can consume a significant amount of your time, especially when farming materials to craft gear for each slot. There are also additional missions I haven’t encountered before, implemented interactions with traders, and microtransactions are already in place, including a gacha system — although I can’t seem to interact with these in-app purchases yet, so it must be a placeholder for now.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI haven’t experienced any crashes in my testing, nor have I encountered any disconnects, which is a significant improvement compared to my testing last year. However, the game is still marked by bugs, clunkiness, and performance issues. There are various UI and questing issues, control clunkiness, especially with the camera and combat. When facing multiple enemies, the game’s performance still bogs down. Having said that, it's crucial to remember that this game is still in its early stages of development, and improvements are likely.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nExploring the fusion of Starstride’s MMO-Monster Hunter dynamics within a Sci-fi high fantasy backdrop is indeed a refreshing take. It shows promise, but it still obviously needs more and serious enhancements as it heads into the upcoming closed beta, if it were to be a success upon release. Even if you are a regular beta tester of mobile games used to early versions, you may still find this version feel very early in its development. Nonetheless, I would recommend giving the test a whirl to see the core idea of the game.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6835393) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nPlants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia, is the third main installment of the popular tower defense game series developed by PopCap Games. In the game, players must defend their home from waves of zombies by strategically placing different types of plants in their yard.\r\nPlants vs. Zombies 3 has had a rough history since it’s initial announcement, it has been soft-launched and re-launched, revamped multiple times that I could count, that it even added a ‘Welcome to Zomburbia’ subtitle now with its recent release. With today’s news, it feels like REAL release is coming soon, as Plants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia has now soft launched in limited regions. Players in the UK, Netherlands, Australia, Philippines, and Ireland will have early access, with more countries coming at a later date.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Addictive gameplay\r\n- Charming simplistic cartoon visuals\r\n- Optimized for bite-sized gaming sessions\r\n- Homescape-esque style of decorating the town and environment\r\n## Cons\r\n- Very simplified mechanics compared to its predecessors that it loses a lot of depth\r\n- A bit too much handholding with the tutorials, very unliberating for the player\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nPlants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia continues where the first two games left off: an army of zombies is on a quest to invade your town Neighborville (yet again), and your only line of defense is an arsenal of quirky plants with special abilities, thanks to Crazy Dave, a humorous mainstay character who aids players with tips and acts as a guide. It still has that same style of humor and creativity into its story. The premise is just enough to provide a basic backdrop for players to keep blasting zombies using plants.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe game features the same 2D aesthetic with visuals are still charming, colorful, and filled with character. Although honestly, it feels a bit of a downgrade from PvZ 2’s shiny and detailed 3D-ish art design, here in PvZ 3 it adopts a more cartoonish and simplistic design. This shift in style doesn't necessarily detract from the game's appeal though. In fact, the more straightforward design can have its own charm, making the game accessible to a broader audience and emphasizing the core gameplay elements.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nPlants vs. Zombies 3 at its core is a tower defense game that tasks players with strategically placing plants to fend off waves of zombies coming. The gameplay is simple to understand but offers a surprising amounts of strategic layer as players progress through the levels.\r\nThe player's arsenal consists of a diverse array of plants, each with unique abilities. Some are good for single targets, some AOE, some deals massive amounts of damage but is only a one-time use, some are used purely for defensive purposes. The game introduces new plants, boosts, and power-ups gradually over time, keeping the experience fresh and challenging for the first few levels or so.\r\nThe dopamine rush of successfully countering a tough zombie wave using a well-thought-out plant arrangement is one of the game's most rewarding aspects, and it’s quite hard to put the game down once you start playing — it’s still the same feeling over again as with its predecessors. It's still a very addicting game, despite the changes to the mechanics that might not resonate very well with hardcore fans.\r\n## 🚧 A more simplified bite-sized experience\r\nMany things have changed in how the game plays, and most of these changes stem from the game being more simplified to cater to the masses, adopting a more familiar and modern standard of mobile game models.\r\nThe resource cost for the plants has been dialed down from increments of 25/50/75+ to just single digits of 1/2/3+ (which is essentially the same). The levels have been simplified to around a minute each, making it more of a bite-sized game that you can play in small amounts of time, on-the-go, but at the cost of having less depth and action to the battles. Just as the levels starts to get real action-packed and interesting, it usually ends, which is quite unfortunate.\r\nAdditionally, there is lesser strategy now since you won't be able to choose your starting seeds/plants; it's all predetermined per level. As said before, these changes might not resonate well with the more hardcore and strategic PvZ players, but they have the upside of attracting a more casual audience.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game starts with a series of introductory levels, where players learn the basics of planting and defending against basic zombie types. These levels serve as a gentle introduction to the game mechanics, allowing players to understand the roles of different plants. What I don’t like is that the game basically continues this hand holding trend far into the gameplay with basically brain dead levels to ‘show how it’s done’, with no way to skip it if you already know what to do. It kinda kills the otherwise fast-paced momentum of the game.\r\nThe storytelling progression is structured in a way that rewards players with one ticket each for completing levels. Each completed level grants the player one ticket, and these tickets are used to access cutscenes that reveal the unfolding story and unlocks more of the Homescape-esque Garden/Town building aspect of the game.\r\nFortunately, you can skip these cutscenes and you don’t have to use the tickets as you complete each level, you can choose to accumulate tickets for a more extended storytelling experience, it gives players flexibility in how they engage with the narrative while keeping the focus on continuous and enjoyable gameplay. For example, you can play for 10 levels straight to get 10 tickets, so you get 10 tickets worth of continuous story.\r\nThe game also features five lives to use that regenerates over time — much like games like Candy Crush or Homescapes, failing to complete levels will result in lives lost, although it isn’t much of a problem in the first few chapters as you’re given plenty of free boosts to keep going. The game has in-app purchases, such as booster packs that rewards players with free lives, extra coins, power-ups, or boosts to use.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game ran without serious issues on my Snapdragon 888 device, although it noticeably runs at a lower framerate than I'm used to in games. My in-game meter is showing 30FPS but it feels much lower than that with how the game is animated. There are no settings to change, and the only options in the game are turning the audio on and off and adjusting the volumes.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nPlants vs Zombies have really changed with the times. It now feels like a mobile-centric game influenced by modern live service elements instead of a casual indie PC title that the original games were. Still, Plants vs Zombies 3 is a traditional PvZ game through and through at its core, and despite its questionable gameplay evolution, it’s still an addicting game --- now optimized for bite-sized gaming sessions.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6839588) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "title": "A SWEET hack and slash RPG game already, literally | CBT Review - CookieRun: Tower of Adventures",
    "description": "CookieRun: Tower of Adventures 8.0 Action Editors' Choice Download",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "8.0\r\nAction\r\nEditors' Choice\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nThe game is currently on a closed beta testing phase that runs from Jan 20 to Feb 4, 2024 and it only features selected game modes and characters for testers to try. Release date is planned for this year.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story follows GingerBrave and his friends who encounters the Sugar Star, who tells the legend of a hero with a shining heart of a brave cookie. With guidance from the Sugar Star, he embarks on a delightful adventure through the Pancake Tower aboard a cute train, tackling challenges, gaining allies, and discovering the prophecy of the shining heart of a brave cookie.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nMaintaining the vibrant and colorful CookieRun aesthetic, Tower of Adventures features the delightful art style, but now in 3D. The characters, including enemies, are all charming and visually appealing. The game features a lighthearted tone throughout the whole experience, with a whimsical soundtrack playing even during intense combat scenarios.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nCookie Run: Tower of Adventures features a hack-and-slash APRG experience reminiscent of the Diablo games. Unlike other CookieRun games, players actively control their cookies through various levels and challenges within the Pancake Tower. Navigate through obstacles, performing simple platforming sections, and defeating enemies — regular mobs and bosses alike.\r\nEach level presents collectibles like coins and hidden chests, with specific goals and challenges with a star rating to enhance replayability. The player can switch between two selected cookies on the fly, each having a unique moveset and abilities. The active control includes managing the dash, normal attack, special attack, and ultimate abilities for the cookie characters.\r\n## ⚔️Combat and Characters\r\nCombat is more involved, emphasizing timing and skill as players strategically dodge obstacles and time their attacks. It’s very simple and straightforward hack and slash system. The special abilities for each other are varied and have different mechanics. Some will require precise aim, some requires charging up, and some are straight up activated and deal massive AOE damage.\r\nThe game features both melee and ranged characters and there is definitely a cookie suited to whatever playstyle you prefer. The acquisition of the different characters are done via the gacha system.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nIn Story mode, the characters embark on a quest to overcome challenges, solve mysteries, and prevent some impending threat to the CookieRun world. These challenges may be tied to the unique gimmicks and themes of each chapter within the tower.\r\nCertain levels feature wave modes where players face a continuous stream of enemies in multiple waves. The challenge intensifies as players progress through each wave and there may be some gimmicks like falling floors or gusts of air put within the levels to spice up the challenge.\r\nPlayers can go solo, or also team up with up to three other players to participate in raids. Raids involve facing powerful bosses and provide an opportunity to earn special rewards. Apart from the main set of story missions, players can engage in specific challenges designed to help them farm different kinds of materials essential for character progression.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game features an energy/stamina system consumed when taking on missions, designed to limit play, although it’s not really a problem in the early stages of the game and during this beta. The gacha system is another key element of CookieRun: Tower of Adventures, primarily allowing players to acquire new and duplicate cookies. The leveling up process involves using materials and duplicates obtained through gameplay or purchased with in-game currency. Equipping cookies with weapons, gear, artefacts, along with enhancing these items is part of the overall progression.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nWhile the monetization model as always, is not final in this preview, the game includes typical elements found in gacha games, such as in-app purchases, cosmetics, booster packs, tickets for gacha rolls, and energy. I do hope the game will be free-to-play friendly when it releases.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game's technical performance is commendable, running smoothly my Snapdragon 888 device. The mobile-oriented UI is clean and easy to navigate. The simplicity of the visuals and UI design ensures that the systems are easy to grasps. Overall, the navigation feels a little bit slow with its animations, however its still an excellent experience for players.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6844120) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Palworld Mobile\r\n9.0\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nTest\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nPalworld, a game that boldly introduces itself as \"Pokémon with guns,\" the features elements of creature “Pal” collecting, base building, and survival crafting mechanics. Developed by Pocket Pair, the game draws inspiration from popular open-world titles like Pokemon, Ark: Survival, Factorio, Zelda: Breath of Wild and more, creating a hybrid experience that feels both familiar but in some respect silly innovative.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game is set on the familiar sounding Palpagos Island (although you can rename the Island), players are thrown into a world — Isekai style — where they must balance survival instincts, creature taming, and ethical choices. Yes ETHICAL choices. DO you want to abuse your Pokemon? Pals? Get them depressed? Hungry? More on that later. There isn’t a really story or campaign mode in this game because this is basically a multiplayer oriented survival crafting game in its core, although it’s a lot more singleplayer friendly.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nPalworld is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and it looks already amazing for an Early Access title, the visuals are characterized by a unique blend of lighthearted and cartoonish designs, reminiscent of traditional Pokémon aesthetics. The creatures, or ‘Pals’, feature vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bear a resemblance to the iconic creatures from the Pokemon franchise. The game's visual style exudes a playful and whimsical atmosphere, but with a touch of violence and mayhem.\r\n## ☝️First Impressions\r\nAs usual with how I approach these kinds of crafting survival games, I almost always aim for weight capacity for the first few levels to get things going and avoid running out of inventory space so often. At first, the gameplay plays like a typical survival crafting experience—gathering resources, constructing structures, and following item recipes and in-game tutorial/guides, but I promise you, the game gets better later.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe ‘Pokémon with guns’ tagline couldn’t be more further than the truth, because the game is actually way more than that. Guns aren’t even in most Pals and you won’t see them as often as you would expect, coming from the tagline.\r\nFor starters, Palworld introduces survival mechanics that offers customizable difficulty options, and allows you to play at your own pace in your own save file; as well as create and join servers to play with other people. As far as singleplayer experience goes, it’s very friendly.\r\nPlayers navigate a technology tree by leveling up, unlocking new structures and items, with later tiers granting access to features like Pal breeding farms and assembly lines. The open-world exploration is filled with encounters with both wild Pals — bosses, regular, and rare pals alike, hostile human factions, and friendly traders and settlements. There are dungeons you can visit, boss fights you can challenge (and capture), and new frontiers to explore and build bases on.\r\nThe gameplay loop involves attending to basic needs, capturing Pals, attending to their basic needs and building a base. The game is basically open-ended and has no clear goal aside from capturing more powerful Pals, further progressing in the technology tree, improving your base, and getting better items.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat is a basic third person setup with dodge maneuvers and features both melee and ranged weapons, similar to the style of the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Combat in Palworld is a blend of weapon-based engagements from wooden bows to powerful automatic rifles; and the unique elemental and powerful abilities of Pals. Encounters with powerful Boss-level Pals and poachers makes the game very emergent, dynamic and provides challenging combat scenarios.\r\n## 🔨Building Mechanics\r\nThe way the game is played is different from the usual building mechanics, now you need to be hands-on the thing that you are crafting or building, no waiting for it to be done in the background. It’s a little more tedious that most survival games, but on the upside, you Pal can craft and build for you and help you with your tasks!\r\nThroughout your playthrough, you get to capture an ever grow stronger roster of Pals at your disposal, and the game starts to gets interesting. Many of the tediousness in the game gets automated with your Pals helping you with your tasks. If you have set things going in motion, they will gather resources alone, store them automatically, prepare food, craft pending items you leave at your workbench, defense the base, and more.\r\nThis is actually one of the only survival crafting sandbox games for me where its actually fun playing alone and its not really a soft requirement to need friends to play with. Because the Pals essentially make your base lively and populates it with living, breathing creatures, and you’ll usually only get in pure multiplayer games.\r\n## 🐲Pals\r\nYou can take up to five pals in your party, but unfortunately only one at a time summoned following you. This is different from your base Pals where they are all summoned, doing tasks, and defending the base.\r\nWhile the design of the creatures called Pals are a little too close to Pokemon-style with its lighthearted and cartoonish designs, the actual interaction with them is anything but and is borderline violent and morbid. You will actually hurt, abuse, and kill these creatures, and the survival of the fittest applies.\r\nFurther on in the game, you get to establishing factories, assigning tasks to Pals, and implementing supply lines. The automation system not only streamlines resource management but also adds a strategic Factorio-like dimension. The intriguing twist lies in the option to potentially exploit Pals for enhanced output, they can be abused, they can be depressed, and underfed and subject to extreme labor conditions.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nPalworld is a tale of two platforms at the moment.  I played on both Xbox and PC back and forth (with the same save thanks to cross progression). On Xbox, I found the experience to be very clunky and stuttery, with visuals of significantly inferior quality. I've encountered constant crashing, black screen, and saving issues,\r\nMeanwhile, the PC version of Palworld is much more optimized. It ran at a locked 60FPS with max graphics on my i7-8700k system and an RTX 3080 (which was more than I expected). This is a surprising reversal from the usual PC = bad, console = optimized. While it still crashes, it happens much less often to the point where it's not even a concern. Fast travel and loading times are super quick, almost taking just 1 second.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWhile the 'Pokémon with guns' tagline may set certain expectations, in actuality, depending on your preferences, Palworld either goes beyond that tagline, or misleadingly underdelivers. What’s However, what Palworld truly is — is a dynamic open-world survival crafting game, filled with exploration, creatures, combat, and emergent gratifying encounters. On PC I would highly recommend this game for Ark: Survival and Pokemon Fans; on Xbox, it’s only a mild recommendation until they can make the game more stable.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6849046) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Artifact Seeker:Prologue\r\n6.7\r\nAction\r\nSingleplayer\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nArtifact Seeker presents itself as a promising 3D Roguelike Survivor RPG game with bullet hell arena elements. Having recently released its demo on January 14, the game offers players a taste of what's to come, featuring two playable characters and the initial two chapters. The full game is just slated as ‘Coming Soon’ on Steam with no clear date yet.\r\n## ⭐️Demo Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nAs of the demo, the story and premise aren't extensively explored, but the game takes place in a world called Aurorium where darkness has consumed everything. This ensuring chaos is merely a game for the gods, and a band of small mortals has attempted to obtain powerful artifacts to help them defeat the darkness and, quite possibly, ascend to godhood themselves.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nArtifact Seeker's visual style is a blend of cel-shaded and comic-book cartoon aesthetics. The 3D models features a somewhat low-fi appearance combined with vibrant and epic looking special effects for the abilities and spells. As for the UI, the menus and general UI design is all over the place. It doesn’t look polished or that pleasing to the eyes, but it’s serviceable for the gameplay intended.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay revolves around surviving hordes of monsters using an assortment of powerful attacks and skills. Unlike traditional arena survival roguelikes, Artifact Seeker introduces a combat system reminiscent of Vampire Survivors but with battles segmented into quick, small-sized sessions. The emergent rogue-like progression occurs between these battles, incorporating dynamic events and randomized rewards and choices.\r\nHonestly, this segmentation is a pretty welcome change, as it fragments the usually 30-minute or so long-winded runs of Vampire Survivors into much more bearable sessions with quick respites of storytelling and decision-making in between. It kind of disrupts the momentum of combat, especially for those who'd like to just keep fighting, but it keeps the experience fresh and gives players other options to increase their power rather than just endlessly engaging in combat.\r\nIn-between these arena-style survival battles are the actual rogue-like progression involving a branching tree layout through a series of nodes.These nodes features many various roleplay events and storytelling elements that give players choices in how to handle them. This adds a bit of personal narrative flavor to the game. The outcomes of these encounters can result in either a reward, penalty, or a combination of the two. The rewards comes in many ways; obtaining powerful artifacts, skills to use, and looting gold to buy and sell artifacts and skills.\r\n## ⚔️Combat and Spells\r\nCombat in Artifact Seeker is dynamic, chaotic, and action-packed, but it only requires players to focus on movement and positioning. Skills and attacks are mostly automated, making it very accessible and non-complex as far as controls go.\r\nAlongside a selection of characters, two of which are playable in the demo, the game allows you to equip up to six skills at a time, each with its unique mechanics and mannerisms. Some are AOE, some spawn randomly, some summon creatures, and some are targeted. These skills accumulate over the course of the game and are primarily obtained during the first few runs. You are at the mercy of RNG when selecting skills, but you can replace any of your six skills whenever you find one that better suits the playstyle you're aiming for\r\nYou can come up with some crazy powerful builds and synergies in this game, and it guides you through the process, showing what's synergistic with what, and assisting you as much as possible to avoid confusion about potential synergies and combos. Once I figured out my preferred build, it wasn't very difficult to actually acquire the skills I wanted and just have fun mowing down hordes of enemies.\r\nDespite the appearance of targeted spells, the targeting can actually be automated for a more movement-only survival experience, similar to Vampire Survivors. However, there are still two abilities that need to be activated manually from time to time and cannot be automated: the dash and the ultimate ability, which is presented in-game in an epic fashion. It is a literal game-changer both in terms of gameplay and visuals.\r\nOutside the dash and ultimate, the game is mostly played with minimal control input. There is even a Mouse-only mode that transfers all the controls to the mouse, allowing you to play with just one hand. Controller support is complete with on-screen prompts, although menu navigation is not quite optimal because most of the design elements were clearly built with point-and-clicking in mind.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe overall technical performance of the demo, including graphics and responsiveness, appears solid, providing a smooth gaming experience with a very low hardware requirements. The game, at least the demo, did not lag or crash during my two-chapter playthrough to end the Demo.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nArtifact Seeker's demo (Artifact Seeker: Prologue) provides a promising glimpse into a unique bullet-hell survivor game, made fresh by infusing rogue-like and roleplaying elements. While the menus and overall UI design may not be very pleasant to look at, what truly matters is the core gameplay itself, which seems enjoyable and solid enough to capture my attention even in its limited demo and build anticipation for its release, whenever it's ready.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6854678) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With 30+ weapons, 30+ powerful mods, 80+ fun relics, and 5 challenging boss fights in the full version.\r\n## ⭐️Demo Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nTime to Strike focuses 100% on gameplay with 0% narrative, the premise is clear – survive the onslaught of enemies, defeat challenging bosses, and aim for the highest score. Players are thrust into a small rectangular arena, armed with their choices to come up with overpowered 'busted' builds and wild synergies.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nI didn’t expect the arena survival genre to appear even more basic than Vampire Survivors, yet, at the same time, maintain a modern look. However, here we are, with a game having a retro vibe but still having sharply designed and streamlined visuals. The art design is straightforward minimalistic, featuring predominantly circular or pill-shaped elements on the screen, encompassing everything from the player character to the enemies and projectiles.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game places players in a compact rectangular arena with the objective of surviving the onslaught of enemies and defeating a series of bosses, all while aiming for the highest score once everything is concluded. At its core, Time to Strike is a twin-stick shooter, demanding the use of both movement and aiming controls—either analog sticks or WASD+mouse. Weapons are not automatically fired; instead, aiming is done manually.\r\nAt its core, Time to Strike is a twin stick shooter that demands both precision and creativity. The player is armed with two weapons – a ranged one that changes with the selected character, and a melee bat called Time Strike, pivotal for both defense and reloading.\r\nThe bat serves a crucial role, capable of deflecting projectiles and activating a bullet time mode. It also plays a pivotal role in reloading your ammo—every successful hit results in a complete reload, and there are no alternative method for reloading besides picking up power-ups.\r\nSwinging the bat is governed by a stamina system, while the ranged attack is managed through an ammo system, in turn being also dependent on the melee stamina system for reloads. There is a separate stamina for the Dash ability, which makes you temporary invulnerable during dashing.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThat’s basically the gist of it. A variety of enemies will spawn with their own kind of gimmicks such as exploding on death, or having undeflectable projectiles, and you’d have to do your best to defeat them all. The rectangular map very small and did not change all throughout the Demo, and it somewhat adds to the challenge.  There is limited space to operate, often finding myself backed against one of its four walls, managing depleting stamina and ammo.\r\nThe fun factor in this game, or at least in this demo lies in creating overpowered builds from a varying of Relics and Weapon Mods that you can select in this game everytime you clear a level. Bullets bouncing? Explosions on Hit? Bullets splitting up? Zombies spawning? Turrets firing? It’s up to you how to come up with game breaking builds. Despite the visual simplicity, the game still does what a bullet hell game does best — cluttering your screen in a chaotic array of projectiles, explosions, and enemies.\r\nWhile these builds can be ultra-powerful, there are instances where their effectiveness works against the player due to visual clutter, obscuring both the player and projectiles, making it challenging to avoid. Fortunately, the game compensates for this by being forgiving in terms of health points, offering players numerous opportunities to navigate challenges effectively.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game begins with the selection of player character, starting traits, and difficulty level. Subsequently, you progress through a series of linear levels one after the other. Upon the conclusion of a run, you earn currency to spend on unlocking new characters and starting traits. There isn't much variety in the progression and core gameplay loop, as the most of the fun lies in experimentation and seeing your work build.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe demo ran with zero issues and will definitely work on most computers and it’s even a perfect candidate for mobile gaming, although there are no video options like running in windowed mode or changing the resolution.\r\nThere is controller support available in the demo, in addition to the traditional mouse and keyboard controls, but I find that they lack feature parity. When using controllers, there is no way to view the characteristics of weapons and relics while selecting upgrades between levels, requiring a bit of reliance on memory and guesswork. On the mouse, however, I can easily hover over the icons and read the descriptions.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe majority of the relics, mods, and boss relics remain locked in the demo, alongside other characters, starting weapons, and difficulty options. I don't anticipate these locked elements changing the fundamental gameplay; they may just add a few extra hours of tinkering and experimentation.\r\nHowever, there might not be enough content in the full version to sustain prolonged interest. Overall though, I had fun with Time to Strike Demo and managed to clear it twice in under an hour. I feel like I've explored much of what the game has to offer mechanically in this brief demo. Ultimately, Time to Strike appears to be quite straightforward, with a rather conservative scope. If you're looking for a quick rogue-like bullet hell game --- hopefully at a cheap price, to enjoy for a day or two and perhaps return back to occasionally, then Time to Strike might be a choice to scratch that itch once it releases.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6857769) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "8.7\r\nPoint & Click\r\nStory Rich\r\n## $3.49\r\n## ✨Overview\r\n## Pros\r\n- Compelling mysterious storytelling\r\n- Very distinctive unique visual style\r\n- A huge ensemble cast of characters\r\n- Super-quick 100 small chapters that will roughly take you 10 hours to fully finish\r\n## Cons\r\n- Non-existent gameplay, weak detective game elements\r\n- Characters with insufferable personalities\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nThe game is giving me vibes reminiscent of anime/game series Danganronpa or even the TV Show Squid Game with its reality/game show-esque premise and visual novel presentation mixing 2D and 3D visual styles.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe visual novel format of the game combines highly stylized 2D characters with 3D pre-rendered environments, featuring a distinctive and visually striking abstract-like art style. I was initially not a fan of the art style, and the characters are probably not the most beautiful thing to look at for most people, but it has grown on me over time as I played.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nIt’s not even a proper Detective game — contrary to expectations, Methods: Detective Competition is not a traditional detective game where players are given free reign to deduce and analyze. Instead, it leans more toward a visual novel format with detective characters and themes.\r\nThe game involves competing detectives solving crimes created by criminals. The crime scenes require ‘investigation’ but all it is really is clicking where the game wants you to click without much creative engagement and interaction. For example, you are free to inspect the crime scene, but the corresponding inspect buttons ironically obscure or does not indicate the actual items to inspect. Most of the times you don’t even know what you’re about to inspect until you actually select it — and it kind of defeats the purpose.\r\nThroughout the different kinds of investigations, players will be asked questions regarding their thoughts on the solution, and the game will then display the outcome of their choice. It actively guides the player toward the correct answer until they finally succeed. If you make too many mistakes, the game fails, requiring you to redo the sequence. However, in this situation, there's no true failure — you’re free to retry again and again and even fast forward the dialogue; as mentioned earlier, it's more about memorizing the choices and selecting what the game prompts you to choose.\r\n## 📜Story and Characters\r\nAs a visual novel though, Methods: Detective Competition actually has a pretty solid and compelling story. It’s not so much about playing as a Detective but rather experiencing a story that is about Detectives and Mysteries. The game consists of a super-quick 100 chapters that will roughly take you 10 hours to fully finish.\r\nThe competition unfolds in stages, with detectives and criminals eliminated until only one of each remains for a final showdown. Winning as a detective rewards one million dollars, while a criminal victory grants both the cash prize and parole. Special Bonuses in each crime scene add an extra layer of challenge for detectives aiming for complete solutions.\r\nThe game features an ensemble cast of Detectives and you will get to play among some of them throughout the story. These characters have their own unique personalities, backstories, and motivations on joining the competition, and it’s a kinda interesting to watch the competition unfold along with their backstories. These detectives also have their own unique ‘methods’ of solving crimes that will be available to the player.\r\nThe game does predominantly feature insufferable characters, ranging from being too much of a jerk to too much of a weirdo or anything in between, and it can come across as annoying sometimes. There are no normal characters, so to speak; everything is a caricature and attempts to be funny. However, to their merit, the dialogue can be quite humorous. As with the art style, these characters do grow on you and despite these elements, the overall story does a great job of carrying the load of compelling you to play.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nAside from the long loading times the first time you run it, the game ran without issues and provided a generally smooth experience on mobile. The UI is a bit confusing at first, with slightly ambiguous icons for the menus, but it’s not much of an issue once you get familiar to it. Text dialogue can be automated, and its speed can be controlled, although there's no feedback when the text is currently automated, which can be annoying at times.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nLooking at its individual aspects, Methods: Detective Competition really exhibits hallmarks of mediocrity that I don’t really like: The weird art style, the insufferable characters, and the almost non-existent gameplay. However, when combined together and treated as the visual novel that it is, they all mesh into a cohesive visual novel experience that sucks you in easily and has you blazing through the chapters (a hundred of them) in a short while; you wouldn’t even notice the time pass by.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised myself that I am liking this game more than I expected. In essence, as a visual novel experience, Methods: Detective Competition stands as a solid title, offering an experience well worth the price of admission on Mobile, especially if you love visual novels and mysteries.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6858719) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nYi Xian: The Cultivation Card Game is an online deck-building game that blends elements of card battles, autochess, and rogue-like genres. With both a focus on both PvP and PvE modes, players embark on a journey of cultivation, drawing cards and strategically building decks from scratch.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Charming and distinct art style\r\n- Building decks from scratch every match keeps gameplay fresh and dynamic\r\n- Excellent 8-way PvP system\r\n- Excellent rogue-like singleplayer PvE game mode\r\n- Good free-to-play model; everything can be bought with F2P grind, with in-app purchases for cosmetics\r\n## Cons\r\n- Heavy reliance on RNG system to draw wanted cards\r\n- Minor translation and localization issues\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThere is little story in this game, aside from the tutorial segment where you take control of the first character in the game Mu Yifeng, while training with the other characters. Apart from being set in a fantasy version of ancient China, the backdrop itself is ambiguous at best. However, in the PvE rogue-like game mode, there is a little bit of dynamic personal story roleplaying with how you are presented with randomized encounters and choices.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nYi Xian: The Cultivation Card Game features a distinct ancient Chinese mythological-inspired art style with a mix of cartoonish design. The animations are detailed — the swinging of swords, swaying of clothes, and hair — character movements are all charming and exquisite. They are executed in a stylistic cardboard-like movement, reminiscent of classic 2D Adobe Flash animations. The soundtrack is relaxing, although its variety is a bit lacking for a game you’d play for hours on end.\r\nThe English translation is a bit spotty; some aspects are still untranslated, and the voice-overs are always in Chinese, but it’s generally intelligible. Understanding some of the terminologies used in the game mechanics can be challenging at first, and the tutorial only does an okay job of introducing the mechanics. However, you get used to it over time as you play.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game is a deck builder at its core, but the card lineup is randomized every match, and players build their decks from scratch each time. This adds gameplay variety and freshness to the experience, but introducing a bit of reliance on the RNG system to win as you have to rely on it to draw your wanted cards.\r\nPlayers begin by randomly drawing cards from the pool and selecting which ones to place on the table, forming their 'Deck.' These cards are then automatically executed from left to right, offering various effects, modifiers, and synergies with each other. This is effectively an autobattler/autochess experience in deck building form.\r\nThe cards are executed endlessly, looping back and forth until one side drops to 0 health, ending the round. The resolution of rounds takes only a few seconds, as the game automatically speeds up the rounds exponentially faster until the round ends. I do wish there was a way to stop this speeding up, at least in the single-player version, as it’s enjoyable to see your deck synergy in full action instead of in ultra-fast forward motion.\r\nThere are many mechanics at play here, featuring various card types: passive cards, cards that require Energy to activate, cards that need other specific cards beside them to trigger a bonus attack, cards that only run on one loop and do not activate again, and perhaps cards that start weak in the initial cycles but become exceptionally powerful as you accumulate more cycles —- in turn, easily countered by burst damage cards aiming to end the round early.\r\nThe way the cards interact with each other is very strategic and engaging, as there are just so many things you can do with them. It's a matter of balancing offense and defense, choosing between aggressive and defensive cards, or perhaps deciding between early high damage output or a slow build-up.\r\nThe matches start with just initial three card decks but expand as the rounds progress. Throughout the matches, players have a set number of redraws each round, providing additional chances to secure desired cards for their decks. They also have the option to ‘absorb’ cards to increase their 'Cultivation level,' which determines who gets to move first in the rounds and unlocking 'breakthroughs' that offers powerful character-specific bonuses. You can view the opposing enemy’s deck of cards once they have been revealed, so that you can adjust and counter.\r\nA minor pet peeve I have in these deck-building games, which this title also partially has, is that it's hard to see all the cards without hovering over the cursor onto them. This occurs mainly when you have many cards in your hands, and it gets crowded — though this doesn't happen too often.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nAside from being a deck builder, the act of building a deck every match makes the game rogue-like by definition in both its single-player and multiplayer modes, as the game features two main modes: a rogue-lite PvE mode and an 8-player PvP mode with ranked and unranked matches.\r\n## ⚔️PvP\r\nThe 8-way PvP, reminiscent of Teamfight Tactics mechanics, is an interesting approach that made the matches more fun and engaging for me. Each match consists of multiple rounds, with participants paired with a new opponent each round until only two participants remain. It's not solely dependent on two people or well-balanced opposing teams battling it out; everyone is out for themselves, striving to win as many rounds as possible to avoid elimination.\r\nPlayers have an overall health called Destiny, determining who gets eliminated. Players take damage when they lose a round, and when it reaches zero, they're out. The 'live' deck-building nature is a great mechanic, allowing for exciting comebacks as some builds may not seem strong initially but become powerful as more pieces fall into place. I've experienced being ahead by a lot, winning more than 10 consecutive matches, only to lose to a low HP opponent who completed a powerful build. I've also made comebacks after losing consistently in the first few rounds, eventually creating a decent build.\r\n## 🕹PvE\r\nThis exciting aspect of dynamic matches are also present in the PvE rogue-like game mode. Instead of an 8-way PvP with rounds and matches, the game transitions to a more rogue-like format with encounters, events, and choices in-between the matches. You still get to build your deck slowly from scratch.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nAs for monetization, the game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. What's great is that all the characters and content can be unlocked through free grinding. While you can spend money on cosmetics and artwork, it's not a requirement, and the game avoids a pay-to-win system. In fact, in this game, I find the non-premium currency is more powerful than the premium currency, which is very uncommon for a F2P model.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nDespite infrequent server connection issues, performance-wise, I had no problems with the game; everything ran smoothly. My only gripe comes from the English localization, which definitely has room for improvement. The game is very lightweight and even seems a perfect fit for a mobile port.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI have played many rogue-likes and deck builders in the past few months; due to this, There is a possibly that I might be experiencing some mild form of genre fatigue one way or another. However, this potential fatigue didn't bother me at all and didn't stop me from being impressed by Yi Xian: The Cultivation Card Game and fully enjoying its engaging rogue-like deck-building gameplay in both its excellent PvP and PvE game modes. Despite some minor language barrier, It’s definitely a must-play for deck builder and rogue-like fans.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6866609) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nEnshrouded drops you into a mix of survival, crafting, and RPG action in a voxel wonderland. As the Flameborn, you're the last flicker of hope in a world desperate for it. You scavenge through fallen kingdoms, build stuff, and battle your way through natural and supernatural critters. All this to gather enough strength to face the horrors hiding in the Shroud, a misty nightmare covering the land and thus making it “Enshrouded”.\r\nFinally, after trying out the Enshrouded Demo a few months ago and getting excited for the release, the game has finally come out — at least in Early Access. I’ve tried the Early Access release version, and so far, so good already.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Impressive high quality visuals\r\n- A mix of Survival Crafting, ARPG, Exploration, Platforming, and more\r\n- Granular base building system that lets you build up to the smallest details\r\n- ARPG style combat — like Dark Souls or Breath of the Wild\r\n- RPG progression system with skill trees and class professions\r\n- Optimized performance\r\n## Cons\r\n- Missing some very useful quality-of-life features\r\n- The controls is a bit awkward, especially for controllers\r\n## ⭐️Early Access Release Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThere’s not much actual storytelling, but Enshrouded establishes a compelling backdrop with its premise of being the Flameborn, the last glimmers of hope in a world on the brink of extinction where the Shroud is covering the land in darkness. Scavenging through remnants of a fallen kingdom and rescuing other NPCs to become valuable allies becomes not just a gameplay mechanic but a narrative element.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe voxel-based graphics even in this early access version are pretty fine looking, super clean, and has no business looking this good. Enshrouded features immersive lighting effects, stylized character models, and beautifully crafted landscapes from lush forests to desolate, enshrouded regions. The game ran with Auto HDR on my PC and it was just simply gorgeous to look at.\r\nMight seem like a minor thing, but my favorite part of the visuals is the foliage — the grass, leaves, and plants — they actually nailed the presentation and it looks even better than most AAA games, with this crazy level of detail and polish that caught me off guard. Coming from playing Ghost of Tsushima which had the best-in-class foliage system, I was wonder why can’t other games pull it off too, well — Enshrouded is one of those games that has managed to pull it off.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThink Valheim meets Breath of the Wild – that's Enshrouded's playground. Survive, build, and dive into action RPG goodness. You're not just crafting; you're crafting with style --- and with friends. But it doesn’t stop at those two games only: playing it, you’ll probably find more elements inspired from other games as well, and they might be too many to mention. What matters is, the gameplay does seem to work.\r\nIt features typical open-world online survival crafting elements, gathering for resources (trees, stones, etc), building your bases, and crafting materials and survival gear. The game opens up very early, but there are different quests that you can follow, especially in the first few parts of the game where you are still trying to grasp what you can do in this game.\r\nA huge part of this game is the focus on Exploration, that is — not everything can be gathered nearby, you really have to travel around to get materials that you want, as well as to get the help of NPCs that you want. There is also a Zelda-like dungeon crawling/exploration element with some of the locations, filled with Zelda-style puzzles and hazardous platforming. Grappling Hooks and Gliders? You name it.\r\n## 🔨Building\r\nBuilding can be a bit confusing at first, kinda like Fortnite controls, heavy on the scroll wheel. But once you get the hang of it, I could see the building getting crazy fast.  The building mechanics here let you get super detailed with small cube constructions.\r\nIt's not like those normal survival games with huge 1x1 blocks – here, the sizes are ¼ smaller, making the equivalent of a regular 1x1 block an impressive 4x4, providing builders with greater flexibility and precision in their constructions. You can still build 4x4 structures right away, and even build 4x4 walls and floors on the spot. The inventory space is super forgiving, and you can build and carry a lot of stuff without intense farming — although I wish this part can be tweaked, especially if you’re the host or playing in singleplayer.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat is where Enshrouded shines compared to games like Ark:Survival or Rust. Inspired by Valheim, Dark Souls, and Breath of the Wild, it's adopts a more ARPG style of combat with a huge freedom to the movement. Target locking, Timing, dodging, and parrying matters. Melee, ranged, or magic – pick your poison. Switching between them feels smooth, and the game throws in platforming elements and puzzles to keep things interesting.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nAside from upgrading your home base and finding NPCs, Leveling up and spending skill points is the main source of character progression. Enshrouded really has done it all by including RPG elements, a skill tree, and class system aswell ala-Skyrim. Customize your character with skills like reduced weapon degradation or enhanced endurance in the misty regions; or focus on class-based perks — the usual RPG stuff – wizard, battlemage, ranger, assassin, warrior, barbarian, and more. It really feels like i’m playing a good mash-up of every game I mentioned, with Survival Crafting as a core.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nDespite the game being in Early Access, the performance is actually good. It ran very well on my i7-8700k PC with an RTX 3080. Far better than other survival crafting games, while also looking much much better. The game running in on its own engine is definitely a good thing — it even has support for DLSS. No major game-breaking bugs encountered, but I've experienced some freezes or crashes, though they only happen rarely. When they do occur, I was glad my progress is always saved as soon as I reload the game.\r\nController support is already present although it’s a bit awkward to use at the moment, and thinking about it, the keyboard+mouse controls are a bit awkward to use too. There are lots of quality-of-life features still missing, or still not yet implement that I would have loved to have, such as auto-run, separate buttons for sprinting and crouching, or perhaps the ability to use materials directly from storages as long as you’re in your territory – small changes that could make a big difference.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nPalworld may have taken a lot of the spotlight, and this release might have been bad timing for Enshrouded, but the game is really solid Early Access outing overall. It offers a different take on survival crafting than other games do and is much more focused on delivering an Adventure and Action RPG-like experience. I know you're probably busy with Palworld, but I highly recommend giving Enshrouded a try next. It might just be your next obsession.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6869691) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nUgly is a 2D puzzle platformer that immerses players with an innovative mirror and swapping mechanic. The game centers on unraveling the protagonist's mysterious past through a series of intricate puzzle rooms and challenging boss encounters. The game released recently on both iOS and Android, following a release last year on Steam for PC.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Excellent art design\r\n- Atmospheric experience\r\n- Innovative mirror and swapping mechanic\r\n- Excellently paced puzzles and levels\r\n- Both touch and physical controller support\r\n## Cons\r\n- Story is a little too minimalistic\r\n- The blur effect during checkpoint reloads feels unnecessarily disorienting\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nUgly is set in a dark and twisted fairy tale, and plunges players into the intricate recesses of a red nosed nobleman's mind. The narrative unfolds through hidden rooms and hints scattered throughout the game, creating an immersive minimalistic experience where players gradually untangle the protagonist's tragic past — all without use of dialogue or texts. Personally, I found the story a little too minimalistic for my tastes, but there is charm in these kind of narrative styles.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nDespite the name, Ugly is actually a beautiful 2D game with excellent art design characterized by moody cartoonish aesthetics and authentic looking classic-style animations. The game's interactive elements contribute to an immersive atmospheric experience while exploring the eerie and unsettlingly calm ambiance that permeates the levels. It’s not a really a horror game but its still eerie and unsettlingly calm, with very minor jumpscare moments if you’re not paying enough attention.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nGameplay in Ugly revolves around a puzzle-centric approach, with players utilizing the mirror mechanic to navigate through challenging puzzle rooms. One button summons the mirror, which in turn summons your mirror image as well. You can summon the mirror horizontally or vertically, which will affect how your mirror image moves.\r\nMoving around the world moves your mirror image inversely on the other side, and with a press of a button you can swap places with it, leading to an interesting platformer experience where you need to pay close attention and utilize your surroundings to reach otherwise unreachable places.\r\nUgly gradually introduces more elements in the levels as you play, such as the pink goo that stops you from swapping, a ticking clock that forces you to swap, or the crystal blue ice that interacts physically with your mirror image.\r\n## 🧩Puzzles\r\nEvery big level there is a collection of rooms containing puzzles inside to solve, and you are free to choose in which order you want enter and and solve them. The puzzles are excellently paced, they are evenly spaced apart and divided into these little bite sized rooms that are easy to digest.\r\nThere is a variety of puzzles to solve; some are pure platforming challenges, while others are more interactive or might require some physics or timed element to solve. Some puzzles are easier than others; though there are challenging ones demand a lot from you that might seem impossible and can be frustrating. Apart from solving this wide range of puzzles, I was surprised to encounter boss fights in this game, but they bring another layer of freshness to the experience every time you complete a section.\r\nThe game also allows the player to restart/return to checkpoint at any time, and it is part of the game’s narrative as one of the protagonists abilities which is neat. There will be platformer/puzzle dead ends in this game that require the use of the restart button more often than usual — which feels refreshing honestly. Might come across as a weird pet peeve, but I don’t like being handheld to where I want to go in games; I want actual dead ends from time to time.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game supports both touch and physical controllers, and using both schemes, they are perfectly viable. I found touch a little bit easier since the icons are easy to tap and recognize, but at the expense of blocking some of the screen. Using a controller allows you to see all of the screen, but I found the already simple controls a tad bit harder.\r\nPerformance is good on my phone and with the lightweight nature I’m sure it would run fine in most modern smartphones. One minor gripe — during checkpoint reloads, there is a on-screen blur that is a little disorientating; I wish there was an option to disable it, as It might pose a problem for those who are more sensitive.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nUgly manages to ironically combine aesthetic beauty with engaging puzzle platformer gameplay, making it a solid title to try on mobile if you love puzzle like games. The story is a little bit minimalistic, but it’s inventive ‘mirror’ mechanics and excellently paced puzzles are more than enough to provide a compelling experience.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6870842) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "TEKKEN 8\r\n8.1\r\nAction\r\nFighting\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nTekken 8 is the eighth installment in the renowned Tekken fighting game series, developed and produced by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Released as a successor to Tekken 7, the game introduces several notable features and enhancements, marking a significant evolution in the franchise. The game is now available on all major platforms; PC, Xbox, and PS, and will feature crossplay support so everyone on any platform can play against each other.\r\nIt has been an exceptional six-month period for fighting game enthusiasts. Following the releases of Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1, six and three months ago, we are now greeted with the launch of Tekken 8. Now we got three phenomenal modern gen fighting games in just under a year. Mortal Kombat 1 and Street Fighter 6 were solid titles, and Tekken 8 looks to be equally as solid if not the best in the genre.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful to Tekken’s fighting mechanics\r\n- New gameplay mechanics that evolves the series in exciting new ways\r\n- Solid main storyline plus mini-campaigns for each character\r\n- A variety of game modes for everyone; campaign, local, online, and more\r\n- New specialty style designed for casual play\r\n- Crossplay Support\r\n## Cons\r\n- Too much moves with ‘cutscenes’ during combat that slows the gameplay down\r\n## ⭐️Score: 10/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet in the aftermath of Heihachi Mishima's disappearance, the story begins with Jin Kazama, Lars Alexandersson, and Lee Chaolan attempting to thwart the plans of Kazuya Mishima. The emergence of Kazuya's devil form triggers a catastrophic event, leading to the announcement of a new King of Iron Fist Tournament, where representatives of various nations engage in intense combat. The stakes are exceptionally high, as the winning nation receives reprimands, while the losing nation faces destruction.\r\nThe main campaign will take you around four to five hours to fully complete and features an action-packed experience that’s hard to put down that you can finish it in one sitting (I did). The campaign is a compact experience that features predominantly traditional 1v1 tekken fights with occassional simple quicktime events.\r\nThe Tekken Force or beat 'em up mode is still present in small portions of the game, but the focus is predominantly on the 1v1 fighting format most of the time. It's nice to see the traditional format take center stage in the main campaign — It primarily centers on Jin Kazama but also rotates control among the other characters over the course of the campaign.\r\nThe story amusingly incorporates references and callbacks familiar to longtime fans, delivering them in either epic or humorous tones, while introducing new elements along the way. However, a minor peeve is that the characters have leveled up significantly now, and the power levels are ridiculously high, reaching Dragon Ball Z/Superhero levels with ultimate destruction leaving in the wake of battles, I find this aspect ridiculous when comparing the scale to the more conservative classic titles. Fortunately, Tekken 8 has done something clever to remedy this problem that you’re better off discovering on your own.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nTekken 8 boasts stunning in-game graphics and as usual — impressive CGI cutscenes that are always worth watching. The game's art style captures the essence of the Tekken universe, blending traditional fighting arenas with dynamic, destructible environments.\r\nThe graphics have improved significantly since Tekken 7, evident in the beautiful lighting, highly detailed character models, and super vibrant and electrifying special effects. I've encountered a lot of sentiment suggesting that it looks like Tekken 7, and that was my initial thought as well. However, after directly comparing both games side by side, the differences are actually generations apart like it should be. The bottom line is: visual memory is not always reliable, nostalgia is a powerful thing.\r\nThe CGI cutscenes range from being exceptionally next-gen looking to appearing weirdly worse than the in-engine graphics. In some shots, they looked phenomenal, while in others, the in-game graphics looked even better. Nevertheless, the overall visual quality is just a solid eye pleasing experience.\r\nThere is no localization in this game and everybody speaks in their own Native language. Its weird at first to see everyone understanding every language ever, but its nonetheless a nice refreshing experience instead of hearing everyone's dubbed voices all in plain English.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay centers around traditional 1v1 fighting mechanics, just good ol' classic Tekken gameplay. Combatants on both sides of the screen, taking turns duking it out with combos and moves unique to each character. The game introduces many new elements in its mechanics, especially a new system called “Specialty Move” designed for new players, making it easier to perform combos with simple button presses and thus making the game accessible to a new audience.\r\n## 👥Characters\r\nTekken 8 presents a compelling roster that combines returning favorites with three newcomers. Longtime fans will appreciate the return of many iconic characters, each with their unique fighting styles and personal story arcs. This includes, but is not limited to, the central protagonist Jin Kazama, his fearsome father Kazuya, the female fatale Nina Williams, the powerful Paul Phoenix, and the martial artist Hwoarang.\r\nMeanwhile, there are three new fresh faces; the carefree Azucena, the stoic Victor Chevalier, and the mysterious Reina. Azucena, the first Peruvian character, brings an MMA approach, while Victor, the leader of the Raven Unit, combines sophisticated espionage with close-quarters combat. Reina offers an acrobatic fusion of Mishima-style Karate and Taido and comes with a mysterious backstory.\r\n## ⚔️Combat, Special Style, and Heat system\r\nAs the trend for modern game titles, accessibility is a big thing, like Street Fighter 6’s Dynamic control scheme and Mortal Kombat 1’s Easy Fatalities (although sadly, one that's paywalled), Tekken 8 introduces Specialty move — designed for casual play.  Less ‘git gud’, More ‘have fun’\r\nThis innovative addition brings a new layer of accessibility to each character's moveset, allowing players to easily perform combos without mastering intricate combinations. Players can choose between executing an aggressive specialty move, a defensive/counter power crush, low-focused attacks, or Air Combos.\r\nWhat's great is that you can switch in and out of it on the fly with a press of a button, enabling you to seamlessly integrate it with some of the combos you've learned if you want to. The moves themselves are distinct for every character although the moves do get quite repetitive if you just opt to exclusively use this style.\r\nYou also lose the ability to perform the more simple moves while in this mode, a non-issue though, as it’s just one button to switch back and forth, without any animation or delays. Even for seasoned veterans, I believe it can be useful tool, especially if you want to try out other characters whose moves you haven't really practiced yet.\r\nThe Heat system on the other hand introduces a dynamic element to the traditional fighting game format. Designed to reward proactive and aggressive playstyles, as while in this Heat state, characters not only inflict chip damage and gain additional movesets but also witness changes in the properties of some of their existing moves, such as a heavy guard break. It makes the game more favored towards aggressive players over defensive ones.  Heat state is activated by performing a characters’ Heat engager move.\r\nTekken 8 introduces a health recovery system, a gameplay mechanic reminiscent of Tekken Tag Tournament. A separate white gauge is left during attacks, and represents damage incurred from combos or blocking significant moves, and this white gauge can be recovered back. Unlike traditional health recovery systems, the white gauge does not diminish over time, requiring active engagement and aggressiveness to regain health.\r\nOverall, the combat is solid and remains faithful to Tekken's combat mechanics while introducing new elements and freshness just like a sequel should do. Although, despite these advances on promoting aggressiveness, the game have indeed slowed down over the years by its consistent introduction of animated cutscenes for just about every special move; Numerous new animations, such as burst, rage arts, and heat smashes, function as cutscenes, disrupting the flow of the gameplay at frequent intervals and most of the time in the heat of the moment, and these animations get repetitive overtime.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nThe game features a plethora of game modes to keep players of all kinds busy. Story mode for those looking for a narrative experience, Versus mode for groups of people looking for a shared screen party game, or Online for those competitive enough to challenge like-minded people around the world — Players can engage in ranked matches or more casual quick matches, challenging opponents from around the world even across other platforms with cross-play support — a first time in the series.\r\nThe game also features additional game modes, again for players of all variety. Aside from the main story mode, Tekken 8 also has a side-story mode available for each character featuring the “older” format of Tekken storytelling, where a character progress through 5 stages of match each with their own CGI ending. This way we are really getting the best of both worlds. A central main story line and a separate ‘mini-campaign’ for each character.\r\nAmong other modes in Tekken 8 is the ‘Arcade Battle’, where players select their fighter and face a series of opponents until reaching the final boss.  \"Arcade Quest\", a single-player journey where players create avatars and participate in local tournaments. A \"Ghost Battle\" that introduces a unique practice mode, allowing players to hone their skills against Ghosts that mimic their own fighting styles. And my favorite game mode returning from Tekken 3 — Tekken Ball — The objective is simple: either score points by hitting the ball into the opponent's court or, alternatively, achieve victory by striking the opponent with the ball.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI played the PS5 version of the game, and immediately I noticed the biggest quality-of-life improvement Tekken 8 has over other games in the series: loading speeds. The game simply has ultra fast loading speeds — taking only around a second or two to load matches, although the main bottleneck now is whenever the game is dependent on connecting to the servers.\r\nThis improvement is a result of the gaming hardware generation's emphasis on utilizing SSDs. As for visual fidelity, it's crisp, running at 4K with some minor upscaling for taxing scenes, and maintains a locked 60fps. For comparison, when running Tekken 7, a last-gen game, on my 4K TV, the visuals appeared slightly blurry with a lot of jagged edges. As for the sounds, I did find the Dialogue volume way too low compared to the overall SFXs with the default settings so I had to tweak the sound levels to my liking.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nTekken 8 stands out as the best game in the series by seamlessly blending ease of play with maximum enjoyment. There is just about everything for everyone here: a compelling, focused main campaign; mini-campaigns for each characters with their own endings; a fun local versus mode plus the return of the beloved Tekken Ball; competitive online matches with full crossplay support; and lastly, new elements and freshness that evolve the series in an exciting direction. It’s just easily the best game in the series and is the easiest and most fun yet.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6898157) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Paper Lily - Chapter 1\r\n9.4\r\nAdventure\r\nRPG\r\nGet\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nPaper Lily - Chapter 1 is a narrative-driven psychological horror RPG developed by\r\nLeef 6010. It is the sequel to the highly rated standalone prologue game known as Project Kat released last 2021.\r\nFinally fully released as a free-to-play game a few days ago, Paper Lily - Chapter 1, much like its predecessor Project Kat, presents a unique blend of storytelling, a horror atmosphere, and puzzle RPG elements. As indicated by the Chapter 1 subtitle, it marks only the beginning of a larger series of Paper Lily chapters and effectively serves as its demo\r\n## Pros\r\n- Compelling Narrative\r\n- Beautiful art style; from anime art design to the chibi character sprites\r\n- Varied and interesting puzzles with multiple solutions\r\n- Player freedom and multiple endings\r\n## Cons\r\n- Jump scares that feels unnecessary\r\n- Some puzzles can be frustrating and unforgiving\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe narrative centers around Lacie, a character grappling with a traumatic event, suffering from depression and bullying. As players delve into the game, they uncover Lacie's quest for answers about her peculiar condition.  The main character Lacie is solidly written, realistically flawed, and well believable. Perhaps also relatable to many people, resonating with players who can connect with her struggles.\r\nThe storytelling feels like a visual novel experience — full of text-based dialogue and great still artwork — while presenting choices that impact the narrative and can lead to multiple endings. The game anticipates players making mistakes and thus by design there are narrative dead-ends and  'untimely endings’ in the story. Its like these story-rich rogue-like games where the endless loop of runs are integrated into the narrative. Chapter 1 is standalone and is around four to five hours long, but there are minor connections to the aforementioned Prologue game Project Kat.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe game seamlessly transitions between highly detailed and beautiful anime-style artwork for ‘Big picture’ scenes like character dialogues or pivotal story scenes, pixel art characters in menus, and chibi character sprites during gameplay. This visual variety is great and creates a visually engaging environment that complements the game's psychological horror theme, especially with the juxtaposition of the seemingly innocent and cheerful anime-style artwork with the horror elements during unsettling and surreal set pieces.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nPaper Lily adopts a top-down retro-style with chibi-like characters and a pixelated world view. The core gameplay revolves around decision-making, puzzle-solving, and exploration. The controls are intuitive and easy to grasp — and it mostly centers on moving around, interacting with key items, and navigating the menus to view objectives and use items, this allows players to focus on the task at hand and uncover the story, or die trying, again and again.\r\nThe game starts off very cozy feeling — almost like a slice of life game focused on telling a depressing story about a girl, but a few minutes in, you could tell the game is headed for an eerie psychological horror direction — even without knowing anything about the game beforehand.\r\nPaper Lily is filled with interesting and varied puzzles. Not every puzzle was a hit for me, but the majority of them are solid; from simple instructions and checklists to riddles and audiovisual utilization. The game encourages the player to pay attention to be able to find the supposed solution to all of the puzzles, although sometimes I find pure trial and error working for me just fine, and the game has no problem with you doing that as well. The solutions can become a bit unforgiving and might require you to redo a section again and again, but the does game give you a lot of freedom on how to solve puzzles, and with this freedom of choice also comes multiple possible endings.\r\nHowever, as is usual with these horror titles, jumpscares are one of my most hated elements, and unfortunately, Paper Lily wasn’t spared. There are a few cheap jumpscares in the game that I did not like, and the experience would have been much better for me if they were not included. There is also a presence of a relentless monster that you cannot fight back (another element that I hate) in some sections causing jump scares and instant deaths could create a sense of frustration and disrupt the overall enjoyment.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nChapter 1 ran without any issues for me although I would have loved some nice quality-of-life features such as the ability to totally skip or fast forward texts when replaying a section after dying or during subsequent playthroughs, although the game does include a skip accessibility option for many parts and does feature a checkpoint system on top of a save-point system.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nPaper Lily - Chapter 1 showcases an impressive fusion of narrative richness, atmospheric horror, and liberating puzzle-solving gameplay. Beyond these compelling elements, the game boasts a visually stunning art style that permeates every aspect of its design from the anime-style stills to the Chibi sprites. But that's not all - it’s completely Free of charge. Definitely a must-try if the idea of this game even slightly interests you.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6923452) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse\r\n8.0\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nTest\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nNever Grave: The Witch and The Curse is an upcoming roguelite metroidvania with town building, 4-player coop, and ‘possession’ mechanics to freshen up the genre. The game is set to release in Early Access in Q1 2024, but players can already get a taste of the experience through the already available demo on Steam, and I tried just that. The game supports up to 4-player coop, but in the demo, only singleplayer was possible to try.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThere's not really a clear narrative in this one, and the game — at least the Demo — basically jumps straight into gameplay action the moment you start it. We do know that it’s a tale of revenge by our Witch protagonist against the ones who ruined the whole kingdom, including our town. The church below the town has survived, becoming our staging ground for our revenge-filled dungeon crawling.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nNever Grave features hand-drawn animation and strong vibrant color palette that might remind you of games like Hollow Knight. There game is in some ways morbid with all the corpse reanimation and characters melting into a red liquid but you don’t really notice it amidst all the nice charming art design and melodramatic soundtrack this game has. The world feels like a living coloring book, with vibrant colors and artful detail. The main character is charmingly cute, and the character designs feature a chibi-like aesthetic.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay offers a mix of hack-and-slash combat and possession mechanics, while offering town building elements during moments of respite on your home town. As a metroidvania, 2D platforming elements are a huge part of dungeon crawling — there are secrets to discover, traps to avoid, and hazardous environments to navigate around in.\r\nDeath is an integral part of the experience. The core experience involves repeatedly exploring dungeons, gradually reaching deeper than before, and simultaneously building up your character’s power and the town’s facilities. The dungeons are touted as being procedurally generated, and they are, but I’m not sure to what extent, I’ve noticed recurring bits and segments of levels (similar or exactly the same) returning to my levels over and over again.\r\nAs a roguelite game, the character starts off relatively weak, but then acquire abilities, grimoires, and blessings during runs that temporarily increases you characters power. You get to choose from a list of three throughout the runs. From simple attack and defense buffs, to additional effects such as fire damage upon crit or explosions upon enemy death.\r\nAs for the persistent progression, do you get to upgrade your character permanently by spending resources and gold or perhaps build your town’s facilities for better bonuses and rewards. This is a gradual process — every failed run you reset back to town, but bring something back useful every time.\r\nIt seems like chopping down trees and mining stones as a mechanic isn’t going anywhere, as even Never Grave also features town-building and resource gathering mechanics. Since the town was fully destroyed, it’s part of your task to rebuild it, and constructing new facilities will grant bonuses to the player. These bonuses include the ability to craft new materials, acquire new skills, unlock new abilities, and, in turn, access more facilities to build.\r\nOne more unique element in the gameplay is that with the cursed hat, players can take control of a selected range of enemies encountered in the dungeons. Each possessed enemy grants the player specific abilities, enabling them to open up new avenues of action and temporarily gain advantages in battles – while preserving the main character health points.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat is both challenging and rewarding. It plays similarly to hardcore-style 2D roguelite games like Dead Cells — slash, dodge, jump, and use abilities in order to defeat a wide range of enemies with their own unique mannerisms and attack patterns. Taking control of an enemy by possessing it also grants you the moveset of that enemy. The demo featured lacked enemy variety, but judging from the gameplay trailer, we are about to get a lot more.\r\nThe game is a bit unforgiving with the hitboxes work in my tastes. The character easily takes damage at the slightest touch of enemies. Offensively, the game is a fun hack and slash mechanically, dodging feels responsive and intuitive, and I love how there is a slight visual and audial indicator when enemies are about to attack, but i do feel that the game focuses too much on horizontal attacks, leaving not much option to attack even diagonally especially with flying and elevated mobs.\r\nI also found the game very unforgiving with health points, especially during early runs. You don’t have a set amount of lives you can use per run, and health potions are used sparingly. Just one death and you restart all the way back to the village. You do pick up perks called grimoires across the runs that might contain a free revive or two, but they’re not always guaranteed.\r\nOverall, despite the hardcore nature and some challenges with the mechanics — the demo’s fun hack-and-slash mechanics, coupled with the possession system kept the demo engaging and I was compelled to play the first dungeon over and over again.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game highly recommends playing with a controller, but when I plugged in mine, it didn't show any on-screen prompts for controllers and continued to display the keyboard bindings, which was a little confusing. Besides that, the demo ran without any issues for me, and I was able to play smoothly.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWhile the demo may have showcased the game mechanics in action, it seemed to provide only a very tiny glimpse of what's to come in the game when I compared it with what the trailers have shown. In fact, it's the trailer that actually got me excited about Never Grave, which is set to offer a fresh experience in the roguelite metroidvania genre, with unique elements such as town-building and enemy possession mechanic. Will it deliver? We will find out soon enough. If you are interested in checking out the game, don’t just play the demo; check out the trailer too.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6921002) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Black Moon Playpark\r\n8.2\r\nRPG\r\nAction\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nBlack Moon Playpark is a mobile action role-playing game (RPG) developed by PlayPark, which has recently launched into open beta testing last January 25. Black Moon promises an immersive 2D anime aesthetic and dynamic side scrolling beat ‘em up gameplay.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Visually appealing anime 2D art style with stunning visual effects\r\n- Refreshing beat ‘em up style of gameplay with an ARPG skin\r\n- Unique skill combo customization system\r\n- Diverse gameplay modes (PvEs and PvPs)\r\n## Cons\r\n- Performance was below my expectations (feels 30fps with heavy drops)\r\n- Underwhelming storyline\r\n- Poor english localization\r\n- Frequent in-game pop-ups and a persistent playpark button overlay\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nIn the year 2179, a world enshrouded in darkness — a Black Moon hovering above — becomes the backdrop for the game’s story. The Chosen Ones gather to combat the relentless waves of monsters emerging from the ominous Black Moon. Players will delve into the role of these elite defenders tasked to defend the world from these monsters and unravel the secret of the Black Moon.\r\nWhile I typically try to immerse myself in the stories of the gacha games I play, this time, I found it hard to stay invested. Honestly, the story is not really compelling, it's confusing and laden with a lot of filler dialogue, further exacerbated by a poor translation. It started out strong — an epic fight between all the three playable characters, but then it turns out it was all just a dream.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nBlack Moon Playpark features an 2D anime aesthetic and dazzling special effects during combat. The character designs are well detailed, with an array of weapon, spirit, pet, and monster designs. The vibrant graphics really immerse players in a visually appealing anime world. While there are male characters, the game is predominantly filled with buxom female characters.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay of Black Moon Playpark is characterized by fast-paced side-scrolling beat 'em up combat across various game modes and three distinct playable characters. The main quest serves as the vehicle for story progression, guiding players through a series of levels and chapters, occasionally interrupted by cutscenes and dialogues. Players may also be required to interact with NPCs and take on quests back in their home base to advance the narrative and unlock new activities.\r\nThe core progression aligns with the typical structure of gacha games, which mostly boils down to the acquisition of better weapons, gear, and ultimates (the latter represented by a diverse array of buxom characters), all of which can be upgraded using materials gathered from in-game activities. The game employs a stamina system to limit sessions, which can also be instantly consumed through a convenient one-click grind mechanics. Fortunately, there are multiple ways to refill stamina aside from waiting in real-time.\r\nThere is clearly a game mode for everyone here; the PvE story missions can be progressed in either auto-combat or manually controlled, while certain modes like the PvE dungeon crawling are only accessible through manual control, and others like Arena — can only be resolved automatically. The game features two types of PvP: the asynchronous Arena mode where you can challenge other players’ setups and an actual real-time PvP, the duel mode. The duel mode seemed to be really in real-time, as I experienced noticeable latency during matches.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nBlack Moon Playpark features a rather fun beam ‘em up side scrolling combat with devastating multi-hit attack combos and customization options. The game's combat effects fill the screen with tantalizing visual stimuli, creating an intense and engaging spectacle. However, as the setup mostly resembles a beat 'em up game just with an ARPG skin, many attacks are predominantly oriented in the horizontal direction, and it can be hard to target accurately especially in PvP where everyone is moving up and down vertically as well.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the combat can either be automated or manually controlled, although certain game modes will necessitate one or the other. However, with the game's combat system, automation doesn’t necessarily provide the most optimal way of clearing levels; abilities can miss, and they may be used inefficiently by the automation AI. For example, AI will instantly activate the ultimate skill when there's only one enemy left instead of saving it for the next area or for groups of enemies. I would normally see this as a negative, but the way it adds value to manual control is actually empowering to the player and for those looking to actually control their characters.\r\nThe game also features a unique skill combo system allows players to customize their loadouts and ‘combos’ pre-battle from the skills you’ve unlocked, offering a personalized approach to your movesets. For me, the whole combat was a refreshing sight from all the usual ARPG or turn-based games out there, especially that there is an option for manually control that can actually be better than what the automation offers.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nBlack Moon is free-to-play but there are in-app purchases ranging from additional stamina, materials, premium currency, weapons/character unlocks, or more gacha pulls. It’s technically a pay-to-win, but unless you are actively competing in PvP or are trying to progress in the story as fast as you can, there was little pressure to spend money from me. There’s lots of in-game self-promotion ads in this game and there is even a button Playpark overlay button that will display an in-game browser with ads when you accidentally click it.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game runs decently most of the time (Snapdragon 888 phone); however, there are occasional crashes, and the performance falls short of what I anticipated given the 2D visuals. The game consistently felt like it was running at 30FPS, with significant noticable drops during intense combat, and unfortunately, there were no settings available to adjust the visuals and performance.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nBlack Moon brings something refreshing to the table with its beat ‘em up style combat, customizable skill combos, and a variety of game modes; however, everything else has been mediocre for me; The story, performance, ads, English localization, and probably much more for those ultra-competitive players looking to engage in PvP. Still, if the combat system sounds good to you, it’s worth checking out since its free-to-play anyway.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6927729) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Welcome to ParadiZe\r\n5.9\r\nZombies\r\nSurvival\r\nPS Version\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nWelcome to ParadiZe is an upcoming action RPG developed by EKO Software, scheduled for release on February 29th for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The game offers a unique twist on the zombie genre, presenting players with a world where zombies not only serve as adversaries but can also be harnessed as loyal companions through the use of a special “Zombie Hacking” helmet.\r\nA demo is currently available on Steam free for players to try leading up to the release, and features the first hour or so of the singleplayer/shared screen multiplayer game experience.\r\nThe reality of the zombie genre is that it's overly saturated right now — zombie games left and right, spanning various gameplay styles such as action, co-op, survival, PvP, and even base building. However, not many games have tackled the idea of harnessing these zombies to become actual allies and companions, and Welcome to ParadiZe capitalizes on this unique concept.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet in a world infested with zombies,The ParadiZe organization has discovered a method to control zombies, turning them into obedient servants. ParadiZe is also the name of their flagship neighborhood touted as a haven of peace where zombies are servants and companions instead of mindless devourers. The main narrative follows our silent protagonist’s attempt to find and explore ParadiZe to find a safe have, while uncovering the mysteries of the zombie apocalypse.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nWelcome to ParadiZe features graphics and an art style that balance seriousness with a touch of humor. It features an top-down isometric view that would remind you of games like Dysmantle or How to Survive. The graphics are decent for its top-down view, although the details are noticeably lacking in quality during close-ups in dialogues, at least in the demo. The visuals include entertaining moments, such as zombies being propelled from the ground or zombies with funky looking animations, contributing to the overall comedic and self-aware tone of the game.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay of Welcome to ParadiZe revolves around looting, crafting, and exploration in an open-world setting. Drawing inspiration from EKO Software's own previous title, How to Survive, the game features an isometric viewpoint that provides players with a comprehensive view of the environment. One distinctive aspect of the game is the ability to control zombies, termed Zombots, using an automation “hacking” helmet. Players can utilize these reanimated allies for various purposes, such as resource gathering, combat assistance, and even as mounts. Players can also customize these zombies appearance and equip them with weapons and gear such as guns, or rocket boosters for mobility.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat in Welcome to ParadiZe involves a variety of weapons, both melee and ranged, with players able to equip and switch between up to two of them at a time. The combat mechanics are very straight forward and resembles twin-stick shooter controls, left stick to move, right stick to aim and shoulder buttons to attack — with a basic dodge roll and using healing items to regenerate health. Weapons and ammunitions are either found, looted in the world or crafted by the player. The combat has a solid feel to it, hits are satisfying on both melee and ranged combat, and the controls are very responsive, especially the dodge controls.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game features an interesting progression system featuring a skill tree divided into Hacking, Combat, and Survival, enabling players to unlock new abilities for both themselves and their Zombot companions. Additionally, players can construct and upgrade their own base in the wilderness, providing a safehome and a way to gather resources in the wild, and craft more powerful weapons. Players can assign zombots to safeguard these bases and automatically gather resources for them, which really sounds like Palworld with zombies or perhaps what would happen if Palworld and How to Survive had a baby.\r\nThe demo was cut short once I built my first few buildings, so I haven't really delved deeper into the base-building mechanics. However, thus far, it is an interesting gameplay loop they have here and this will become even more fun when played cooperatively.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game run without any performance issues, although the visuals are a bit grainy looking. I cannot seem to turn off FSR so I settled for the Quality setting once I noticed it was on Balanced as default, but the visuals still looked grainy and has a lot of annoying visual artifacts. As for the controls, they already work fine and it even has proper controller support and local/shared screen multiplayer properly built-in.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWelcome to ParadiZe is a refreshing take that is worth checking out amidst the already saturated zombie genre. I'm personally excited to check this game out when it releases on February 29, especially since I've been looking for decent shared screen coop zombie games these past few years to play with friends. Its unique concept of harnessing zombies as allies, base building mechanics, along with a focus on cooperative gameplay with shared screen functionality, are enough to differentiate it from the hundreds, if not thousands, of zombie games out there.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6934755) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "MATR1X FIRE\r\nAction\r\nShooter\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nMatr1x FIRE is a 5v5 competitive mobile first-person shooter with a unique blend of cyberpunk aesthetics, strategic team-based matches, and integration of blockchain technology.  The game is currently on a beta testing phase that started last Jan 26 and will last around a month and a half.\r\nDeveloped as a flagship product for the MATR1X web3 entertainment platform, the game explores a dystopian future Earth where players engage in battles to reclaim data sovereignty from powerful entities. There are NFT and crypto elements in the game and is being touted as a play to earn game, where players have the opportunity to earn NFTs and digital art assets like weapons, skins, and accessories, all while playing.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 5/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet in a future Earth facing resource depletion in an era dominated by artificial intelligence, the game's narrative revolves around the Matr1X Alliance. This alliance emerges as a response to organizations like Uranus monopolizing human data sovereignty. Players find themselves thrust into a conflict to reclaim control and engage in direct confrontations against the oppressive forces. Matr1x FIRE is just one of many games planned to be set in this conflict and universe.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nMatr1x FIRE features a blend of futuristic and stylized realism with clean and well-defined character designs, environments, and in-game elements. The visuals are sharp, lightly colored, and easily distinguishable, allowing players to quickly identify characters and objects. The environments and character designs incorporate futuristic elements such as advanced technology, cyberpunk elements, sleek architecture, and high-tech weaponry. The weapons and characters comes in different skins as part of the game’s cosmetic system that is tied to it’s NFT elements.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nMatr1x's flagship product, Matr1x Fire, is a first-person shooter game designed for mobile devices. Players choose characters from a roster and engage in five-person team battles. The game may look very similar to the game Valorant, featuring similar color palletes, weapon designs, character styles, and even the menu animations, which in turn most of it inspired by another popular shooter, Counter Strike; But playing the game, the gameplay format it has adopted is actually much closer to Counter Strike than Valorant — no hero skills, no flashy abilities; only grenades like flash, smoke, and frag grenades which adds a lot of tactical element into the game that CS players will find very familiar with.\r\n## 🔫Gunplay\r\nAs usual with this gameplay format, there is no ADS (Aim Down Sight) system like those found in PUBG or Call of Duty except for a limited selection of weapons like the Sniper Rifle and the Steyr AUG equivalent. Matr1x FIRE places a high value on precision and accuracy. Moving while shooting significantly reduces accuracy, encouraging players to stop or use controlled bursts for better accuracy — although here I found the system is more forgiving since its using touch-based mobile controls.\r\nIt also features a similar economy system for its rounds. affecting the availability of weapons and equipment. Teams need to manage their finances to ensure they can afford the most effective weapons for each round.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nThe current test version features three main game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Competitive mode. Deathmatch is your basic \"kill everyone  you die and respawn immediately upon dying\" mode, with the first player to reach 40 kills winning the round. Team Deathmatch is a 5v5 fight, and the first team to reach 70 kills wins.\r\nThe Competitive mode serves as the main focus of the game and includes the iconic Bomb Defusal game mode, along with familiar map layouts that CS players will easily recognize. I've played on maps with layouts very similar to Dust II, Inferno, Mirage, among other examples. With one side aiming to plant a bomb at one of the designated bomb sites labeled A and B on the map and the other side defending these sites or defusing the bomb when planted. The round ends when either the bomb explodes, eliminating all defenders, when the bomb is successfully defused, or eliminating all attackers when defused. The team that wins the round earns a point.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game itself is a decent CS/Valorant mash-up when it comes to the game mechanics, but in my experience with my Snapdragon 888 device (ROG Phone 5), it suffers is from massive performance issues—particularly heavy stuttering that I experience during the start of rounds and when the game is loading new entities, such as changing the spectating player or loading new weapons.\r\nThis stuttering is happening even with the game at its lowest settings and even throughout the middle of matches, and this basically makes the game borderline unplayable, sometimes the freezes are so severe that you cannot do anything during preparation time at the start of matches.\r\nConnectivity-wise, I was getting good latency to the servers, but I still experience occasional disconnects and lags. One time I even got disconnected from a competitive match and I had no way of reconnecting back. And it's not just me; when spectating other players, I also notice it happening to them—AFKs, players lagging, and running towards walls are all too common. There are also various major issues still in the game such as characters T-posing randomly, or effects not loading properly. Still, its worth nothing that the game is still in beta, things will still improve and this review does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDespite its promising Valorant/CS-inspired gameplay, Matr1x FIRE faces significant technical issues during the beta phase that need to be addressed if it is ever going to compete with the heavy hitter games. If the dev team manages to pull it off and delivers a polished game upon release all while we are still waiting for Valorant Mobile, it might just capture the market. If not, then it's still a nice stop-gap of a game while we wait.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6938408) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Sword of Mystic Shu\r\n7.2\r\nRPG\r\nMMORPG\r\nPre-register\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nSword of Mystic Shu is an upcoming MMORPG game developed by Chengdu Yimoxuan-Zhonglou Studio. The game aims to provide an original and immersive experience for fans of Xianxia, a genre deeply rooted in ancient Chinese culture and mythology. The Open Beta Test (OBT) started last January 31, 2024, offering players an opportunity to explore what the game has to offer, at least in early access form.\r\n## ⭐️Score: 4/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe narrative of Sword of Mystic Shu centers around an ordinary mortal's journey to become an immortal hero. Players will level and gear themselves up, progressing through the nine provinces, engaging in battles against demons, and ultimately ascending to the top of the nine heavens. The story starts off a little timid, involving basic interactions with a bunch of NPCs and featuring dialogue that isn’t particularly compelling. Honestly, the narrative isn’t very interesting as of this beta test. I do hope this gets more fleshed out upon release.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nDeveloped on Unreal Engine 5, Sword of Mystic Shu features highly detailed character models and textures, creating a visually stunning world — that is if your device can handle it, or if you are playing on PC. The art style integrates ancient Chinese cultural elements, as expected with a Xianxia-type of game. Sword of Mystic Shu also features modern technologies such as HDR support and Lumen lighting from UE5. I tested the game’s open beta on Android, but judging from the screenshots showing keyboard controls and PC-like high quality visuals, there may be a PC version coming as well. The game is available on both Chinese and English localization, although the option to switch from the default Chinese to English is further in the game, after you’ve created your character.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nSword of Mystic Shu features a typical third-person MMORPG gameplay style, which promises to immerse players in a vast and dynamic open world. Engage in exploration, quests, and various activities as your character journeys through ancient Chinese landscapes.\r\nThe gameplay in Sword of Mystic Shu centers around an expansive open-world design. As of this open beta, players have the freedom to explore the map without fog of war or fast travel restrictions, though certain activities are still restricted based on character levels. The game offers a variety of activities, including monster hunting, quests, boss fights, and material gathering, and a lot of systems for progression such as finding powerful talismans, skill tree systems, and character stat attributes.\r\n## 🚶Characters\r\nThe game starts off by allowing you to create your character (up to three), with plenty of customization options ranging from the face, hair, eye features, to gender. From here you could already see that the graphics are of AAA quality, at least in terms of character details. There are numerous \"Origin\" choices available to add flavor to the character, such as Birthday, Constellation, choice of Flowers, and more. Although I don’t know the extent of how these choices will affect the actual character.\r\n## 🌍New player experience; Quests, Tutorials, etc\r\nUpon entering the vast open world, players are presented with a variety of basic quests that aims to familiarize players with the game's mechanics. However, there are still a lot of things that weren't covered in the tutorial — in which it was actually fine, if only the gameplay was compelling enough for players to learn on their own.\r\nMost quests are relatively uninteresting, primarily involving back and forth “Talking” with NPCs, talking about generally non-sense and trivial in-lore things. Further on, the main quest introduces a powerful boss to defeat. Unfortunately, the game fails to provide further guidance on mechanics, leaving players to figure out how to defeat this formidable endgame-like opponent by themselves.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe overall gameplay experience is marred by clunkiness across various aspects, especially the combat. Combat feels stiff, animations and movement are awkward, and navigating menus is cumbersome. Despite visually appealing effects and skills, the combat lacks inspiration and it fails to translate into a satisfying visceral experience. The combat lacks mobility and most attacks and abilities are done in a stationary position. Mobs lack aggressiveness and just blindlingly walk around like a robot until attacked.\r\nThere is also an awkward transition between combat and non-combat that requires a loading screen, only to load you at the exact same spot, but with enemies. When the combat encounter is complete, you are then immediately and unceremoniously greeted with a “leave mission area” button as soon as the last enemy hits zero HP, and the fact that you don’t even see the last enemy dying it breaks the experience.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nUsing a midrange phone that was once flagship-level two years ago (Snapdragon 888), the game's performance is sluggish even at the lowest settings and with a low render resolution set. Massive lagging, frequent model and texture pop-ups, and elements not loading properly leading to invisible stairs, walls, and floors are all too common. The game is still clearly in the early stages of development and will definitely require significant improvements before it even becomes playable, and even more to become enjoyable.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game seems to be adopting a free-to-play MMO approach with microtransactions, although billing is currently disabled in this open beta test. Will this game become a massive pay-to-win endeavor? We're not entirely sure, but I do hope it is free-to-play friendly.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nSword of Mystic Shu's overall gameplay, from interactions with NPCs to combat mechanics, appears to be in dire need of refinement. Even for seasoned beta testers used to testing the buggy and unfinished states of early access titles, this particular version of Sword of Mystic Shu may still feel remarkably early in its development. If you're seeking to play rather than explicitly test software, I would not recommend this open beta just yet to fully enjoy or even just explore what the game has to offer.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6940797) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "One Punch Man: WorldSEA\r\n8.5\r\nRPG\r\nAction\r\nPC Version\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nOne Punch Man: World has finally launched! bringing forth an action-adventure gacha experience set in the One Punch Man universe. The game covers the first season of the anime, but also introduces new original stories involving various side characters, for the main quest and overall game progression. The game is currently available on iOS, Android, and PC.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful adaptation of anime scenes\r\n- Impressive cel-shaded visuals that could give the Anime a run for its money\r\n- An exhilarating combat experience\r\n## Cons\r\n- Uninteresting filler-esque story\r\n- Too much trivial mini-games and activities\r\n- Stingy gacha rates\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe central storyline follows the unparalleled hero Saitama, whose ability to defeat any opponent with a single punch has left him yearning for a worthy adversary. Players will still assume the role of Saitama, but the game mostly follows side characters, going as far down the roster with heroes like Lightning Max, Smile Man, Golden Ball, and other more obscure heroes, each contributing to an overarching narrative that unfolds within the confines of the Hero Association.\r\nThe story serves as a stop gap filler in-between major events in Season 1 that shows the a glimpse of the life of these Hero side characters as well as interacting with the civilians affected by all these destruction. It’s almost a slice-of-life story told within the One Punch Man universe, complete with exploration and free-roam around the city.\r\nThe premise itself is interesting, but the way it is presented—lots of running, talking, the pacing, and the silent dialogue—does not make it compelling. Players can still relive some of the events of the anime’s Season 1, one episode at a time. On the other hand, this aspect is done very well and is faithful to the Anime, but players will need to progress through the main game's story to unlock them.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe cel-shaded visuals are simply masterfully executed and in my opinion looks as good as Madhouse’s animation of the first season, you can almost forget that it’s a game and not a new Season. The game faithfully recreates scenes from the anime using its 3D cel-shaded graphics engine. I find the engine so impressive that I would have no qualms if it were used instead to generate anime scenes quickly, if it means we can have future seasons soon. While there are returning voice actors from the anime, there’s still a lot of unvoiced dialogue.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nOne Punch Man: World follows a gacha game model with action-oriented gameplay, reminiscent of titles like Genshin Impact and Aether Gazer. Players assemble a team of up to four heroes, embarking on a variety of missions to combat monsters and villains. The gameplay, typical of anime action games, grants players freedom of movement, dodging/blocking, and activating unique abilities for each hero.\r\nEach hero possesses a distinct ability and move set, providing varied combat mechanics, Even identical heroes come with different variants, each offering unique abilities. For example, an SSR Genos variant may seamlessly switch between melee and ranged attacks, while another variant may cater more to a ranged playstyle. Saitama also has multiple variants, from his Long Haired Salaryman days to being Saitama in Pajamas — each with different movesets.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nMirroring the intense action of the anime, the combat in One Punch Man: World is an exhilarating hack-and-slash experience, with some options for automation. Every strike delivers a satisfying punch with stunning visual effects, capturing the essence of the Anime's magnitude. The game is at its peak when in the heat of combat, especially during the main story missions where you are controlling the main heroes like Saitama and Genos. The gameplay effectively translates the heroes powers into a hack-and-slash-style format.\r\n## 📜Progression\r\nFollowing the introduction, the game introduces side characters like Lightning Max, Smile Man, and Three-Staff Lilly, exploring their stories within the Hero Association. Other heroes are primarily obtained via the gacha system but can also be acquired through other ‘free’ means, such as completing quests (it even offers free SSR characters via these quests) and progressing in the story. Although some suspension of disbelief is required, as you can obtain and use heroes like Saitama or Genos, which aren’t really part of the game’s filler-esque narrative.\r\n## 🌍World and Side Activities\r\nAside from Story missions and Anime story missions, The game features various side missions and activities, plus exploration of A-City at leisure. Convenience stores offer stat-boosting meals, and arcades host One Punch Man-inspired versions of classic games.\r\nThere are also various mini-games and segments in the story that I feel like this game doesn’t know what it wants to be and might be experiencing an identity crisis. A whack-a-mole mini-game to keep yourself awake during cinema? A sneaking segment to escape hospitalization? An investigation mini-game? Why the hell not? The game feels a little too bloated with these things included, all I was expecting is a hack-and-slash game set in the One Punch Man universe focused on what the Anime does best = Action.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game is free-to-play with in-app purchases for gacha rolls and premium currency. The gacha rates are notably low, but the introduction of a pity system somewhat mitigates this issue by guaranteeing an SSR item on the 60th pull. There is also a steep price of $45-$50 for just one pull. In my experience though, the game provides enough free resources to clear content, and both SSR and SR characters are viable for gameplay.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nTechnical performance is acceptable, but there are occasional drops in performance during action-packed scenes, even on my Snapdragon 888 device (ROG Phone 5). The game also supports frame rates of up to 60 and 120 FPS, and has an extensive graphics settings. I’ve experience some connectivity issues during launch, but it became easier to connect as time went by.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nOne Punch Man: World is at its best in its faithful adaptation of iconic anime scenes and in delivering an engaging combat experience. When all cylinders are firing, expect an exhilarating, fun hack-and-slash game. However, the game loses focus by including too many trivial mini-games and activities, and the filler-esque story presentation doesn’t help. Instead of doubling down on the action, it attempts to do everything, much to its detriment. Adding to that the stingy gacha model, and it results in unfortunate game that could have been a masterpiece of an adaptation.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6949803) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "NBA 2K24 MyTEAM\r\n7.8\r\nNBA\r\nSports\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nNBA 2K24 MyTEAM is a mobile iteration of the NBA 2K series, focusing on the MyTEAM game mode. Available for mobile, it offers players an immersive and realistic basketball simulation on the go. The title aims to cater to both avid NBA fans and 2K newcomers, providing a dynamic blend of team-building, strategic gameplay, and competitive online experiences right at players' fingertips.\r\n## Pros\r\n- The gameplay mirrors the core NBA 2K24 basketball simulation experience\r\n- Impressive visuals that looks AAA-level\r\n- Both singleplayer and multiplayer game modes (3v3 and 5v5)\r\n- Officially licensed NBA players and teams\r\n- Physical Controller Support\r\n## Cons\r\n- Hard to find matches and imbalanced match-ups\r\n- Cannot use real team rosters from the NBA in any game mode\r\n- Access issues on select devices\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nNBA 2K24 MyTEAM Mobile upholds the high visual standards of the series, delivering a realistic and visually impressive basketball simulation on mobile devices, with player models, animations, and environments designed to be as realistic and as close to their console counterparts as possible.\r\nWhen I played on a mix of medium and high settings, the visuals looked AAA-level amazing, albeit noticeably 'toned down' compared to the console versions. The graphics can be finely tuned to support older hardware, but don't expect the same visual fidelity and performance when playing on low settings. I found the UI icons to be of low resolution and pixelated, and the overall menu design seemed somewhat amateurish and barebones.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay mirrors the core NBA 2K24 basketball experience, providing the same gameplay feel to it from the motion captured animations and realistic physics engine to the intuitive controls and game mechanics. Touch controls are seamlessly adapted for mobile play, while still properly supporting physical controllers for gameplay (since touch is still used for menus).\r\nHowever, MyTEAM is all about blending team management seamlessly with on-court action. Players start with a basic roster and gradually build their dream team by collecting player cards and/or upgrading the rating of  current cards. It's important to note that this is not a traditional NBA 2K experience, as you cannot select real-life team rosters to play with. Hopefully, in the future, a game mode will be introduced that allows players to engage with actual team rosters, similar to the setup in EA FC Mobile or eFootball.\r\nSkillfully executing plays, making strategic decisions, and precisely controlling players contribute to the intensity of each match, in which the game can be played on either singleplayer or multiplayer across various game formats.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nNBA 2K24 MyTEAM features both a singleplayer and multiplayer experience. In singleplayer, players can engage in dynamic 3v3 matchups, full-scale 5v5 games with four 5-minute quarters, or opt for a condensed \"Clutch Time\" mode with a single five-minute quarter – perfect for quick gaming sessions.\r\nOnline modes offer the chance to challenge real players in 3v3 and 5v5 settings, while a cooperative 3v3 mode allows players to team up with friends, with each player controlling an individual player instead of a whole team. The game's unique \"Clutch Time\" mode is available in both singleplayer and online, offering an intensified 5v5 experience with shorter, more intense matches.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nNBA 2K24 MyTEAM is free to play, accompanied by in-app purchases for the currencies VCs and MTs, allowing players to buy card packs and other in-game items, either via a gacha roll or directly acquiring them in time limited deals. MTs can still be acquired by playing regularly, but players can expect a decent amount of grind to get these. Those seeking to expedite their progress or enhance their team quickly can opt to spend money, thus making the game pay-to-win, especially if you’re playing online.\r\n## 🌍Matchmaking woes\r\nIn my experience, finding matches takes a long time, and when successful, the solo matchmaking system appears imbalanced, probably due to the lack of players in my team level. Latency disadvantages aside, My 72 OVR team got matched against none other than a team featuring LeBron James, a 96-rated Jermaine O'Neal, plus another 89 rated player. At the very least, you can still play singleplayer and have fun by myself. Honestly, its a better option for me.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWhile NBA 2K24 MyTEAM excels in delivering a visually stunning experience, there have been reported technical issues online in which I’ve also personally experienced. The game seems to be selective when it comes to compatible devices, as it just crashed on my newer ROG Phone 5 while redirecting it to a 2K “Code of Conduct” website as if I was banned. I installed it on my older Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Tablet (Snapdragon 855) and it worked without these issues.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nTechnical issues and weird device compatibiltiies aside, NBA 2K24 MyTEAM's gameplay successfully mirrors the core NBA 2K24 experience while emphasizing team management and player card collecting elements in MyTEAM mode. The game modes offer a diverse range of options for both singleplayer and multiplayer engagement. However, it's worth noting the potential pay-to-win elements and matchmaking issues, particularly if you intend to play competitively online.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6947662) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Children of the Sun\r\n10\r\nAction\r\nStrategy\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nChildren of the Sun is an upcoming tactical puzzle-shooter video game developed by René Rother and published by Devolver Digital. There is no release date yet announced but a DEMO is available on the Steam platform, offering players a glimpse into a dark and intense narrative with a simple Sniper-based puzzle gameplay.\r\n## ⭐️Demo Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe narrative centers around a character known only as \"THE GIRL,\" seeking revenge against the malevolent cult responsible for ruining her life. The story unfolds without any dialogue, relying on cutscenes and graphic illustrations to convey the dark truths about the mysterious order and the atrocities committed in the name of their enigmatic leader, \"THE LEADER.\" The disturbing themes of death, suicide, murder, and cult activities set a grim tone, creating an unsettling atmosphere that adds depth to the revenge-driven plot.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe visuals is just as disturbingly presented as its premise, there is an intentional choice of a low-fi style for graphics adds a gritty and raw quality to the visuals, amplifying the unsettling themes embedded in the game's narrative. The minimalistic approach to character design and environmental details, coupled with the low-fi filter, contributes to a stark and haunting aesthetic.\r\nThe game also embraces a soundtrack that is deliberately disturbing as well, with heavy use of  low-pitched bass and screeching elements that results in an unsettling auditory experience. This deliberate stylistic choice both in audio and visual, enhances the impact of the disturbing themes, immersing players in a world that is as visually unsettling as it is narratively intense.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe demo introduces players to the tactical third-person puzzle-shooter gameplay, where they must first assess the location for enemies, and fire their one and only bullet. Players will now then assume control of a single bullet, navigating it through increasingly complex and challenging levels.\r\nWhen it hits an enemy or a point of interest, you can “re-fire” the bullet again from that position to another enemy or point of interest. It’s basically a game like connect the dots, but you are connecting assassinations together. If you fail to kill all targets in one swift combo, the level fails. If you complete the mission, you are scored based on various criteria's such as speed, body parts hit, and distance.\r\nEnemies who see others getting killed will react and sometimes flee, making them harder to hit, so there is a little bit of stealth elements in it. There is an additional “re-fire” ability while the bullet is mid-air, that requires hitting weak-points of enemies to fully activate.\r\nThe mechanics of how you control and see the bullet are executed in the first person, as you're experiencing what the bullet sees. However, the game switches to a third-person view of the bullet when you're not controlling it. If you've ever played the Max Payne 1 and 2 games and used a sniper, that's essentially how it is presented. The later Assassin’s Creed games also featured a skill where you can 'steer' the trajectory of the arrows you fire, and that's essentially how the controls work mechanically.\r\n## 🌍Levels\r\nThe demo includes seven levels that showcase the lethal replayability of Children of the Sun that will last around 30 minutes to complete. Multiple solutions for each level encourage creativity and experimentation, rewarding players for accuracy and efficiency. The limited resource of having just one bullet per level intensifies the challenge, making every shot count. The design of the levels reflects a careful balance between tactical sniping, puzzle-solving, and light stealth, offering a varied and engaging experience that keeps players on their toes.\r\nSome enemies will be deliberately far from each other, separated by an obstacle, are moving around the map in a vehicle, etc. requiring players to think strategically and plan their shots meticulously. The demo provides a taste of the intricate level design that promises a satisfying blend of action and strategy in the full game.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI didn’t have any issues with the demo and I was able to play with a smooth and responsive experience. The game's low-fi graphics and minimalist style contribute to a consistent and stable frame rate. The game supports both mouse and controller, although using the mouse is noticeably easier because you can aim faster and more accurately will can result in higher scores. The game is completely playable with just a mouse and requires no keyboard input.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nChildren of the Sun strength lies not in complex gameplay mechanics but in its ability to create a puzzling tactical challenge within a seemingly straightforward framework, as Children of the Sun, at least the demo for now, manages to deliver a satisfying puzzle-solving experience within its simplicity. However, its intensely disturbing themes, both in terms of narrative and presentation, are definitely not for everyone. Players should first consider their comfort level with such content before embarking on this dark journey.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6958563) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nDeath Stranding is an action-adventure game developed by Kojima Productions and directed by Hideo Kojima. Initially released for the PlayStation 4 in 2019, with a subsequent release for Microsoft Windows and now for iOS/iPadOS/Mac Apple devices, the game has garnered attention for its unconventional gameplay mechanics, immersive storytelling, and cinematic presentation. The game is currently being sold in the App Store for $19.99, 50% cheaper than current other offerings.\r\nDeath Stranding is renowned for its departure from traditional gaming norms and what adopts what I would like to call an “anti-game” approach. Players assume the role of Sam Porter Bridges, portrayed by Norman Reedus (known for his role as Daryl Dixon from the Walking Dead), navigating a post-apocalyptic world to reconnect isolated cities affected by the mysterious \"Death Stranding\" event. The gameplay emphasizes the journey itself, with a focus on planning routes, managing cargo, and traversing challenging terrains.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Stellar cinematic experience\r\n- Beautiful visuals\r\n- Deep complex narrative\r\n- Unconventional fresh gameplay mechanics\r\n- Unexpectedly Immersive async multiplayer components\r\n## Cons\r\n- Frame rate issues, occasional freezes and crashes\r\n- Touch controls still not recommended, similar to other recent AAA ports to Apple\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📊Technical Performance (iOS/iPadOS/Mac Port, Controls, Performance, Visual Quality)\r\nSince this is an Apple port of a rather technically impressive AAA game, I opted to discuss this first for those curious about how the port is, and my verdict is that its… Acceptable. If you’re looking for a more general review of Death Stranding, skip to the next part of this review.\r\nThe implemented touch controls in Death Stranding are marginally better than Capcom's implementation with RE Village and Resident Evil 4 on iOS due to a more customized layout. However, they remain challenging to use as they essentially function as a glorified on-screen gamepad without native adaptations to the controls. For example, the game heavily relies on both L2 and R2 to balance your character while moving, and it’s hard for me to consistently do that with the touch controls, so with that I would still strongly recommend using physical controllers, and if you have played the game before with controllers, you will have an intense urge to do just that.\r\nPerformance is kind of a mixed bag. It targets a 30FPS frame rates just like the original PS4 version, but I’ve encountered heavy frame drop issues on my iPad Pro M1 test device and sometimes even going as far as freezing the game that would sometimes require a full relaunch of the app.\r\nAs for the visuals, it runs at a lower resolution than its console counterparts, but by no means does it look bad. It still looks impressive, especially during cutscenes and character close-ups, the details still stand out and you’re still getting a stellar cinematic experience. It's just one of the last major games released for the PS4/PS5 now running on a phone, much like RE4 and Village. While not perfect, it's certainly a good start.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe narrative of Death Stranding is set in a desolate unfamiliar world affected by the eponymous Death Stranding, a mysterious event that has resulted in otherworldly consequences. The entire premise is challenging to describe and, even more so, to digest, but it revolves around themes of human connection, loss, and the exploration of the consequences of scientific experimentation. These themes are accompanied by stellar performances from a star-studded Hollywood cast.\r\nThe game is brim-filled with heavily directed cutscenes and dialogues that will literally take hours to experience. Checking YouTube compilations alone, all cutscenes span around a total of over 11 hours, and that's only the cutscenes and not gameplay. The game is simply a cinematic masterpiece of an experience that is as much a movie as it is a video game, and blurs the line between the two medium.\r\nThe storytelling is characterized by its complexity, gradually revealing a narrative puzzle that engages players on both intellectual and emotional levels. It’s a very deep game, one that might require multiple playthroughs and perhaps watching youtube video analyses to fully understand, but one that has affected me profoundly and is current one of my five favorite video games from the last five years recently. ( https://www.taptap.io/post/5863861 )\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nPowered by the Decima Engine — the same engine that powers the stellar Horizon Zero Dawn, Death Stranding boasts stunning graphics that capture the haunting beauty of its post-apocalyptic landscapes. Death Stranding has probably the most realistic and immersive landscape visuals that I’ve seen in video game recently, and with its Apple port it continues that trend only on a lower resolution and graphics setting. It doesn’t look as good as the PS4 version when compared side by side, but on a smaller screen such as iPhones and iPads, the visuals look are acceptable.\r\nThe art style is a blend of the hyper-realistic and the surreal, creating a believable world where the lines between natural and the supernatural are blurred. The attention to detail in character models, environmental effects, and the design of otherworldly entities known as BTs contributes to the game's overall atmospheric experience. The Hollywood actors truly resemble their real-life counterparts, and instead of breaking the immersion, as is often the case with popular actors in media, it has the opposite effect, further immersing me in the story.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nUnique in its mechanics, Death Stranding has been improperly described by many as a \"delivery simulator\", mainly because of the traversal and delivery aspects of the gameplay. The weight of cargo affecting your balance and ability to move across the map; the planning of routes and gizmos to bring in; and ultimately the navigation through challenging terrain are central components of the gameplay.  But the game is much more than that.\r\nThere are asynchronous multiplayer elements similar to games like Dark Souls, where players indirectly interact through a shared server/universe with player-made structures and items from simple ladders to as complex as community made highways appearing in other players worlds, helping each other traverse the landscape. Thus making the world feel alive and desolate both at the same time. This social aspect is actually one of my favorite aspects of Death Stranding and one that has immersed me in the game even further more than I expected.\r\nThere are combat and stealth encounters with BTs and hostile factions that mostly follows standard third-person shooter mechanics and they complement the traversal aspects very well by not focusing too much on them and rather haUnlike traditional games where the main gameplay and action take place in cities or destinations, where fast travel is obsessively needed and used by players, Death Stranding is the exact opposite and focuses on the actual journey. ve them happen organically.\r\n## 🌍Travel\r\nUnlike traditional games where the main gameplay and action take place in cities or destinations, where fast travel is obsessively needed and used by players, Death Stranding is the exact opposite and focuses on the actual journey.\r\nThe desolate landscapes, punctuated by hauntingly beautiful scenery, evoke a sense of isolation and solitude. The absence of traditional cities or bustling hubs shifts the focus to the journey between waypoints, transforming the environment into both an ally and an adversary.\r\nThe gameplay revolves around these aspects, rather than the actual destination or cities. Upon reaching these destinations, players will find that there is mostly nothing there but another hologram to interact with.  It serves as a quintessential example of an anti-game in many respects.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDeath Stranding is quite a ride, both literally and figuratively. It's true that the game is polarizing and commonly labeled as a FedEx simulator and surely looks like that on paper, but it offers much more than that. With its fresh unique gameplay and deep narrative, it's an introspective exploration, a visual masterpiece, and the quintessential example of an anti-game. While its iOS/iPadOS/Mac adaptation introduces technical challenges, it serves as a promising start for major games on mobile platforms.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6963929) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Volcano Girl\r\n5.8\r\nSimulation\r\nCasual\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nI recently tried out a game called Volcano Girl, a virtual father/daughter game with management and life-sim elements. This app seems like a trial version of an upcoming mobile port of the popular game Volcano Princess that was released last year on PC. In Volcano Girl, players take on the role of a single parent tasked with raising their daughter after the passing of the late wife.\r\n## ⭐️Trial (Demo) Score: 5/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet in the Volcano Kingdom, the game's narrative revolves around a single parent guiding their daughter through life, studies, and relationships; after the passing of the father’s late wife five years ago. The player — as the father — explores new hobbies with their daughter, engages in different jobs, and influences the daughter's growth over time. The story emphasizes the importance of familial bonds and the consequences of choices on the daughter's future. The intro and its melodramatic soundtrack immediately immerses you in the story and effortlessly places you in the shoes of the father.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe art style of Volcano Girl is characterized by its 2D cartoon anime aesthetics, vibrant colors, and a paper doll-like aesthetic. There is a brownish color palette that adds warmth and nostalgia to the medieval setting, resulting a visually enchanting and nostalgic atmosphere. In some ways the visuals look like early 2000s flash games, especially sim-life flash games in that era. The GUI is a bit rough around the edges in some parts but nothing really bad.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nWhy get a virtual pet when you can have a virtual daughter? Well, Volcano Girl is a point-and-click management game centered around parenting a daughter. Similar to its art style, the gameplay evokes the feel of early 2000s flash games, both in aesthetics and handheld UI/Menus, and also reminiscent of the Princess Maker series.\r\nAs the father, you are presented with many different activities you can do with your daughter that can shape how she will grow up. Talking with her, eating with her, cooking, visiting the village, farming, and even activities inside your home. The village can be explored and many different areas can be visited, and more will unlock as time passes by. Time in the game is divided into turns equivalent into months. Players must allocate their time wisely between different activities to improve their daughters stats and build relationships. The game involves managing various stats and attributes of your daughter. These can include attributes like intelligence, charm, imagination, and strength. Improving these stats is crucial for success in different aspects of the game. Every end of the month you can choose what courses to enroll your daughter in and that will increase their progress in that course until eventually finishing it learning everything from controlling emotion, imagination, or making friends. At the end of the day the game becomes a choice between how you want to spend your time with your daughter to see how she would turn out, the whole gameplay loop is simple but very immersive.\r\nAnother core of the gameplay revolves around building relationships with in-game characters. Players, and their daughter can interact with different characters, engage in conversations, storytelling, contests, and more.  As the months go by, more locations and events will be unlocked, while the daughter will age and mature as time passes in both stats and looks.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nVolcano Girl still has mouse control prompts and lacks full touch control implementation. Some parts, such as mini-games, skill trees, and cutscenes, are either broken or difficult to control. While the game runs flawlessly due to its light 2D nature, it is very unstable and consistently crashes or soft-locks during my playthrough.\r\nBy 'softlock,' I mean touches become unresponsive or cutscenes stop without reason. I have no choice but to skip, and eventually in my playthrough of the trial, I reached a game-breaking moment that didn’t allow me to continue playing at a certain point in the game. I'm not quite sure if this is where the trial ends, but that much is not clear. There are also minor visual bugs at the sides of the screen, not to mention it only runs at a fixed 16:9 resolution on our wider phones.  I may have to revisit this title in the future if ever all these issues gets resolved.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nIn its trial version, Volcano Girl presents a blend of life simulation and a heartfelt narrative that is a perfect fit for mobile devices. However, technical issues of this port currently hamper this otherwise excellent experience that it had on PC. As a demo, it successfully manages to get your attention to want to play the full game to the point that you’d probably buy the already existing PC version now and skip the wait. Otherwise, I hope these issues will be fixed when the game is officially released for mobile devices.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6966976) Originally posted on TapTap.",

With a diverse roster of characters, each equipped with unique abilities and foam guns, players engage in frantic competition across various game modes. The game has recently launched today for PS Plus subscribers with an option to buy it full come next month on March 5, 2024.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Fun highly team based casual gameplay\r\n- PvE game modes both Solo and Coop\r\n- Refreshing PvP game modes\r\n- Vibrant art style and excellent presentation\r\n- Diverse roster of characters\r\n## Cons\r\n- Slow and unengaging gunplay if you’re looking to play it like a shooter\r\n- In-app purchases on top of a need for a subscription or initial purchase\r\n- Lack of split-screen support\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nWhile the emphasis of FOAMSTARS is tightly focused on its vibrant multiplayer arena, there is still a hint of storytelling and world-building elements included in the game, particularly in its Missions PvE game mode.\r\nAs the world's premier sports event, the Foamsmash tournament gathers these capable athletes called Foamstars to showcase their skills, wit, and charisma in a spectacle of foam-fueled competition. Set in the bustling city of Bath Vegas, players find themselves amidst a backdrop of chaos and conflict as monstrous invaders threaten to destroy the city's precious energy cores. As Foamstars, players must rise to the challenge, defending their home turf against the relentless onslaught of creatures bent on destruction.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nFOAMSTARS features a vibrant and colorful art style that perfectly complements its eccentric cast of characters and dynamic gameplay. The graphics aren’t aiming for a realistic look and are all stylized, but they still look impressive, bringing Bath Vegas to life with its neon-lit streets, towering skyscrapers, and vibrant color design. The character designs are quirky and imaginative, with each Foamstar sporting their own unique look and personality. The soundtrack is also a banger and fits the chaotic fun nature of the game quite nicely. How the matches are presented also comes with lively in-game commentary and audible audience cheers that makes it feel like you’re watching a Live broadcast.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nFOAMSTARS is a multiplayer party shooter that prioritizes fast-paced action and strategic team-based gameplay. Contestants use foam to attack, defend, and strategically alter terrain to their advantage. The gameplay is like Splatoon but with a twist, using foams and bubbles instead of inks. It’s not a complete copy, more like just an inspiration, as the gameplay here and matches are much different.\r\nTo start off, players choose from a diverse roster of Foamstars, each with their own unique foam gun with its unique way of shooting foam or bubbles. It can be long range, shotgun type, or a spray type of projectile, or many more. Some weapons will have a charged shot in addition to the regular shot. Players can unleash foam attacks to disorient opponents, create slippery surfaces for mobility by way of Surfing and Sliding around, or erect defensive barriers to shield themselves from enemy fire. When you down an enemy, you need to slide-kick them to fully eliminate them from the competition. On the other hand, teammates revive each other by similarly slide-kicking downed allies.\r\nAll characters will have two abilities and one ultimate, which can change the tide of battle ranging from offensive foam attacks to defensive utilities. Whether it's laying down slippery terrain to skate around the arena at high speeds or creating vantage points to take out opponents, FOAMSTARS offers a wide range of tactical options to suit every playstyle.  You can customize each character’s appearance using cosmetics unlocked through the course of playing the game or buy spending real money via the in-app store; together with your very own customizable personal space called the Personal Lounge.\r\n## ⚔️Controls and Combat\r\nThe controls are responsive, including movement, surfing, and using abilities. However, the gunplay is a little slow-paced and unengaging despite the chaotic nature, as the projectiles are slow and have limited range. It's more of a proverbial tug-of-war between two teams instead of an outright battle of firepower. It loses a bit of the fun factor, especially if you’re playing it like a shooter.\r\n## 📜Game Modes\r\nFOAMSTARS features a plethora of game modes that cater to both PvP and PvE players, mainly with its Missions and Versus game modes.\r\n## 💥Versus (PvP)\r\nVersus is a fun game mode. It doesn't have the typical run of the mill team-based deathmatches, capture the flag, or conquest game modes; Instead, it offers refreshing team-based matches that focuses on empowering and supporting teammates.\r\nThe main Versus mode is 'Smash the Stars,' which starts off like a Team Deathmatch (TDM) but transitions into a Protect the VIP-style gameplay later on. Two teams duke it out, 'chilling' each other until the respawn points of each opposing team reach zero. At that point, a Star Player will be assigned that will need to be protected by their other three teammates, who will have unlimited respawns. The first team to eliminate the opposing star player wins. To simply put, TDM first to determine who’s the star player, then it’s now a battle to eliminate the opposting team’s star player to win.\r\nThere are other modes too like the Rubber Duck party, which is a objective-based push mode that pits two teams escorting an giant Rubber Duck across the map. Happy Bath Survival is a much more support-based format, where teams are divided into two: two supports on the sidelines shooting foams and abilities on the environment to assist the combatants, while two combatants duke it out inside the arena against the other team's two combatants. As mentioned before, all the Versus modes are fun overall and feels very refreshing. The support-based casual gameplay makes it highly encouraging to play. The only thing missing is a color lock/preference option as it can be quite confusing to remember what color you are in the heat of the moment.\r\n## 🌍Missions (PvE)\r\nThe PvE modes are primarily wave defender modes, but the solo and coop experiences are very different. The solo experience is more casual, serving as a glorified tutorial for the player to learn each character. Each character gets their own set of three missions that involve wave defense with a bit of small dialogues in between serving as background story/lore.\r\nOn the other hand, the coop mode is much harder and can only be played on two maps for now: the medium or the hard map. Every wave, players are also given a choice between three upgrades, similar to a rogue-like system, ranging from faster reloads to powerful damage. Eventually, players can upgrade their ‘cores’, meaning they improve their character permanently, exclusively for these PvE missions only.\r\n## 🕹 No local/shared screen multipalyer\r\nI apologize for expecting much more than the game offered, but FOAMSTARS would have greatly benefited if it added split-screen support, mainly for the coop PvE missions. I wouldn’t mind Versus mode having it as well. It would also have slightly boosted player numbers and given it multiplayer life outside of a PS Plus subscription and server/playerbase dependencies. It just seems like wasted opportunity that I hope the developers can implement in the future.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nThe game is available now for all PS Plus subscribers, regardless of Tier. But the game will be available for a direct purchase at around $30 next month, on March 5. On top of a subscription/purchases, the game still has in-app purchases for cosmetics, which is a little bit disheartening. They could have just made it a completely free-to-play game like Fall Guys or Rocket League now, and likely in the future that will be the route that they can take.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nFOAMSTARS presents an engaging and casual multiplayer experience with its distinctive foam-based gameplay mechanics, diverse game modes, and captivating presentation. While the game offers fast-paced battles and cooperative PvE missions, its much of the main focus is on team-based PvP modes that is unfortunately hindered by the lack of splitscreen support, making it highly dependent on the playerbase. Unfortunately, the current pricing model, either through a subscription or outright purchase, limits accessibility and may affect long-term player retention.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6973947) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "In a recent announcement, the developers of Takt Op. Symphony have shared the unfortunate news of the game's impending shutdown. Despite best efforts, changes in business direction have led to the conclusion to shut down the game's servers, according to their announcement. The final day of operation is set for April 9, 2024.\r\n## \"We want to thank all our players for their support and dedication throughout the journey of 'Takt Op. Symphony',\" stated a spokesperson from the game's operations team. \"While we regret having to make this decision, we appreciate the community's involvement in the game.\"\r\nThe development team has pledged to assist players during the transition period leading up to the shutdown and is planning farewell events. All purchases and accounts will be maintained, usable, and playable up until the game’s shutdown day on April 9, 2024. The decision to end operations on Takt Op. Symphony comes as a surprise to its player base, many of which were fans of the Anime TV series Takt Op. Destiny.\r\nTakt Op. Symphony is a musical themed gacha JRPG that has been a standout title for me in the last year when I reviewed it here on TapTap (read review here: https://www.taptap.io/post/5257522) , blending gacha gaming with musical elements, following 2021’s Anime TV series Takt Op. Destiny. It is set in a world where music holds the power to shape destinies, players assume the role of a conductor tasked with leading a symphony of powerful warriors known as musicarts into battle against various adversaries.\r\nThe game features a compelling storyline that unfolds through multiple chapters, delivered in a visual-novel style format with elements of FMV anime sequences. Players meet a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique abilities and musical themes, as they embark on a journey to save humanity from monstrous threats. Combat is turn-based, and the game incorporates live-service elements, including a gacha system for character and cosmetic acquisition, daily events, energy systems, and in-app purchases.\r\nWhile the decision to shutdown Takt Op. Symphony was primarily attributed to adjustments in business development, declining player numbers probably led the development team to the difficult decision, as well as timing issues related to its alignment with the Takt Op. Destiny anime TV series. Originally intended to coincide closely with the conclusion of the anime in 2021, the game's multiple delays may have impacted its ability to capitalize on the momentum generated by the animated series.\r\nIt's an unfortunate news, but that's basically the end point of all gacha games eventually. For some gacha games, like Takt Op. Symphony, the journey may come to an end sooner than anticipated. Let’s just hope they will just continue the stellar Anime instead since I actually enjoyed watching it.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6975440) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "title": "Pretty solid and exciting, but the visuals seem downgraded? | Demo Review - Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth",
    "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth 9.0 Action Adventure PS Version",

    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\r\n9.0\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\nPS Version\r\nThe highly anticipated demo for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has finally landed on PSN, offering players a taste of what's to come in this PlayStation 5-exclusive installment. Announced during the recent State of Play stream and released February 7, the demo puts players into the opening moments of Rebirth, and features iconic characters like Cloud and Sephiroth during the renowned Nibelheim flashback chapter. It took me around an hour and half to fully complete the demo, with a second part coming soon.\r\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is one of the highly anticipated video games this year, serving as a direct sequel to the critically acclaimed Final Fantasy VII Remake, which was released back in 2020. Developed and published by Square Enix, \"Rebirth\" continues the story of the original Final Fantasy VII, diving into the events that follow the escape of protagonist Cloud and his companions from the city of Midgar.\r\n## ⭐️Demo Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe demo explores Cloud's mysterious past and retelling of his connection to the Shinra corporation, and his complicated relationship with the primary antagonist, Sephiroth; and tells us Cloud’s own experiences during the Nibelheim incident. For the full game, players can expect to revisit iconic moments from the original game, as well as encounter new locations, characters, and story developments.\r\nThe story is much more interesting here than in the ‘FF7 Remake’, as it ramps up leading to the actual major events of the original story, unlike FF7 Remake which was basically an expanded glorified tutorial section in the OG game, filled with filler stories. This demo already got me hooked better than FF7 Remake did in its first few hours.\r\nThe demo also already offers a convenient feature for both returning players and newcomers alike: a quick 5-minute recap of Final Fantasy VII Remake. This recap serves as a neat refresher for those who have played Remake, helping them reacquaint themselves with the events, characters, and key plot points they might have forgotten or missed.\r\nFor players who may not have completed Remake or are new to the series entirely, the recap provides essential context and background information to ensure they can fully appreciate and understand the story of Rebirth. This is true to the statement of Square Enix 8 months ago, saying “We have made preparations so that players who did not get a chance to play the first game can fully enjoy Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.” Although personally speaking, nothing beats having played the games yourself.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe game is powered by Unreal Engine 4, it features ultra-detailed character models that far eclipses the quality of the original PS1 game, with expressive facial animations and fluid movements across the board. The lighting engine is equally impressive.\r\nPlaying the Rebirth demo on the PS5, the visuals are at a level of fidelity similar to that of the FF7 Remake on PS5, although for some reason (probaby the more open world nature) this demo looks worse and blurry, especially in Performance mode, which is weird because the previous game Remake had no problems running at 60FPS on the PS5 while still looking crisp and sharp.\r\nBesides that weird and disappointing downgrade in sharpness, There isn’t any major jump in graphics, so expect ‘FF7 Rebirth’ to simply be a direct continuation visually, narratively, and mechanically.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nBuilding upon the foundation established by its predecessor, FF7 Rebirth introduces new combat mechanics, including the innovative Synergy Abilities. These unique combo attacks, filled by the Active Time Battle gauge, add a new found depth and excitement to the gameplay, allowing players to unleash devastating combined assaults between characters.\r\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of the combat system of FF7 Remake overall, as I found the animations stiff and system overall shallow, and it doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be turn-based or real-time. There are pretty good real-time pausable RPG games, but the system in FF7 Remake was not one of them. That being said, the combat in Rebirth feels actually better, the animations are smooth, hits are more gratifying, and the combat overall feels more responsive and mobile.\r\n## 🌍Exploration and Content\r\nThe demo showcases not only the gripping narrative and refined gameplay but also provides a glimpse into the expansive world of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Players can look forward to exploring a new and bigger region, the Junon area, which will be added to the demo later in the month.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWith promises of a yet another 40-hour campaign and brand new locations to discover, Rebirth sets the stage for an immersive and unforgettable midway point for the whole Final Fantasy VII remake saga. The narrative is what I’m excited about the most, but I’m personally curious to see if the overall gameplay will be better this time around.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6978559) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "## [BETA] Kingdom: The BloodTest Global\r\n8.2\r\nZombie\r\nRPG\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nThe game is currently on a beta testing phase here on TapTap that will run from Feb 5 to March 4, 2024, with the game also scheduled to release in March 2024.\r\nI totally watched the Netflix series when it came out, both seasons and currently waiting for the third, so now I'm stoked to discover that a game is being developed based on the series. Aside from Mobile, the game seems to be coming out for PC too, judging from the in-game tooltips, and true enough, when checking online, the game is also listed on Steam.\r\nEven though the zombie genre is quite saturated, it never stops surprising us with new concepts and premises to tackle, such as Kingdom’s ancient Korea period combined with zombies.\r\n## ⭐️Beta Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nSet in ancient Korea during a zombie apocalypse, Kingdom: The Blood follows the struggles of survivors as they battle hordes of undead and navigate political intrigue. Drawing inspiration from the Netflix series, the game captures the essence of traditional Korean culture while delivering a thrilling narrative filled with suspense and danger.\r\n## 🎨Graphics and First Impressions / Performance\r\nImmediately, the graphics are outright amazing. It features realistic AAA level-visuals along with a pretty robust character creator, although I had to tone down the settings because I prefer smoother frame rates over the eye candy. One commendable feature, though, is that the game actually has a skip tutorial section right from the start, which is something that ALL games should have. I actually used this feature immediately since after the tutorial, I realized I had to change servers, and thus, my progress was reset.\r\nThe game’s performance is a bit laggy in this beta, even when I toned down the settings to medium on my Snapdragon 888 device (ROG Phone 5), still can’t quite reach a stable 60FPS. Having said that, the game ran much more smoothly during indoor boss fight segments.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nAs a third-person hack-and-slash ARPG, Kingdom: The Blood emphasizes fast-paced combat and survival gameplay. Players wield melee and ranged weapons (depending on the character) to dispatch enemies, utilizing a variety of skills to create devastating combos. The game features a chapter-based progression system, with each level filled with zombies and human enemies alike and culminating in challenging boss fights.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe game is a third-person hack-and-slash game that might remind you of games like Nioh or Dark Souls. The combat is actually decent here. It feels good on the offensive, animations feel smooth, and slashing zombies is gratifying. Defensively, it's another story; parrying attacks is clunky and doesn't work 90% of the time. There is a huge input lag for both parry and dodging, and zombies' only attack is to grab you and lock you in an annoying biting animation. Seriously if they manage to fix this, the game the combat will be much better.\r\nThere are two characters to choose from, each with his/her distinct set of weapons and combos. The male character is a traditional melee sword fighter with powerful moves, while the female character is an agile fighter wielding two short swords and a bow and arrow for her special attacks.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nAs you play, you can unlock more skills to use and even upgrade their stats. There’s only one main resource/currency for now, but the foundation for a gacha or in-app purchases is in place, and this seems to be going for that free-to-play model when it releases.\r\nThe main progression is the PvE system that is set up in a chapterized manner and comprised of levels you have to clear zombies with along with regular human enemies, culminating in a Souls-like boss fight at the end to clear the chapter.\r\nOther game modes are available in the game, a PvP mode called Clash and a group/clan-based activity called Raid, although I wasn’t able to check out these modes as the Clash mode kept kicking me out of the game while queuing, and the Raid mode needs a full lineup of clanmates in order to start.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThis beta build of Kingdom: The Blood already shows promising combat potential with its fast-paced and gratifying hack-and-slash gameplay. However, current issues such as clunky defensive mechanics and performance may hinder the overall experience. Nonetheless, for fans of the series and those intrigued by the premise of zombies in medieval Korea, the game offers an immersive world to explore and battles to conquer.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6980791) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Starstride\r\n8.4\r\nAction\r\nSpectacle fighter\r\nPre-register\r\nStarstride, an upcoming MMORPG blending elements of high fantasy and sci-fi, continues its journey with a new beta test, yet again inviting players to further explore its expansive universe, quickly following a previous test phase that started last January. The new beta runs from February 7 to February 20, 2024, and I was able to revisit and try out the game again.\r\nUnlike previous tests, this time players will receive a substantial amount of in-game currency and item support, empowering them to customize their characters and gear to their liking.\r\n## ⏫Notable Improvements\r\nI was able to test this new beta version and immediately I noticed the more subtly refined combat system, featuring smoother animations, as well as improved combat flow between attacks. Players can anticipate a more seamless and engaging combat experience as they unleash devastating attacks and master their chosen combat styles.\r\nAdditionally, the progression system has been revamped, offering a more engaging first-time experience to guide players through the mechanics of the game. Overall, the performance of the game has seen a marked improvement across various aspects. I’m also seeing a lot more players now in the City Hub just running around making the world livelier than previous tests.\r\nHowever, the removal of the auto-run feature, while it did have its share of bugs, has left a void in terms of convenient traversal between map objectives. Additionally, I've personally encountered issues with the minimap and quest markers, requiring a little bit of guesswork to locate objectives.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe premise of Starstride revolves around future humans settling on a super earth alien planet, in there two allied factions, Neoterrans and Wokens, locked in a fierce conflict against a formidable alien civilization. As one of the few remaining powerful warriors, players must choose a faction and embark on a journey to become the ultimate Star Warrior. The game features a fusion of high fantasy and science fiction, featuring high-tech futuristic elements as well as mythological like-creatures such as Dragons and Gigantic Animals.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe graphics are decent, and in some shots can look like AAA, but it’s inconsistent and needs more polish. The open world of the game features diverse environments from lush forests to futuristic cityscapes. The character designs visually striking and anime-like in its exaggerated armor designs and proportions, completing the game’s over-the-top action nature.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nStarstride offers a diverse range of gameplay mechanics, including exploration, questing, combat, and social interaction. Players can explore vast open-world environments, complete quests, engage in dynamic combat encounters, and interact with other players in the bustling City Hub. The game features a seamless blend of PvE and PvP content, providing players with a variety of opportunities for adventure and excitement.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat in Starstride is fast-paced and action-packed, with fluid animations and responsive controls. Weapons come in many shapes and sizes; Sword, Dual Blades, Shield, Spear, Hammer, and even a Whip. These weapons can be changed and equipped at any point in the game, and players have the flexibility to progress and upgrade them concurrently.\r\nThere is a dodge/roll mechanic that gives players a free slo-mo whenever you execute a perfect dodge, as well as “QTE” special attacks unique to each weapon, to finish enemies in style. Overall, combat in Starstride is less clunky than before, but its still clunky overall and needs more work to be actually good, but so far the work they’ve done and are doing is promising.\r\n## ⏫Progression and eventual Monetization\r\nThe characters’ power armor and energy cores are the main centerfolds of the progression and character power. Upgrading them is the best way to get stronger. You have the freedom to create your own character (up to five on the same account), customize their appearance and gear, and choose their starting class. The foundations for microtransactions are already in place, including a gacha system — although I can’t seem to interact with these in-app purchases yet, similar to previous test versions.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nOverall, while Starstride shows promise, it still requires further development before it can truly be enjoyable. It's evident that the game is still in its early stages and has room for improvement. However, this latest beta represents a positive step forward in the game's evolution.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6987233) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "The Pixel Ark\r\n6.5\r\nStrategy\r\nPixel\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nThe Pixel Ark is a mobile strategy game that follows players as they take command of a massive mobile base known as \"The Ark\" and navigate through a post-apocalyptic wasteland, recruiting heroes, and engaging in battles against monsters. The game combines hand-drawn anime aesthetics for cutscenes with charming chibi pixel art for its pinball-like gameplay.\r\nThe game actually went by a different name a month ago, and was also newly released that time. It suddenly underwent a significant rebranding, transitioning from its original title, \"The Wandering Ark,\" to now \"The Pixel Ark.\" This change was accompanied by the release of an entirely new app (with the same game inside) and introduced a host of new problems, particularly for older players.\r\nProgress was not automatically transferred unless players received a code, leaving many longtime players frustrated and feeling alienated. The reasons behind this rebranding remain unclear, with speculation suggesting potential copyright issues or other undisclosed factors. But it’s definitely not because of localization or region concerns, as the original game was already in full English.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Brand new style of gameplay: Pinball combined with RPG?\r\n- Variety of game modes\r\n- Smooth and welcoming progression\r\n## Cons\r\n- Forgettable story\r\n- Inconsistent artwork and quality\r\n- Sudden app shutdown and name change question the longevity of this title\r\n- Lost account and progress from old players coming from the previous app\r\n## ⭐️Score: 4/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe premise of The Pixel Ark remains unchanged, placing players in the role of the captain of the titular mobile base, traversing a post-apocalyptic world, recruiting heroes, and battling monsters.\r\nDespite its initially promising start, the story’s quality faded as the game progressed, with voice acting disappearing and text-based dialogue taking its place. The heroes are drawn from popular mythologies, bringing a sense of familiarity, featuring characters like Odin, Chang’e, Sigurd, and Tyr.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe game combines hand-drawn anime aesthetics for cutscenes with charming chibi pixel art during gameplay. The steampunk and wasteland styles create a unique atmosphere, enhanced by hundreds of heroes drawn from both Chinese and Western mythologies. It literally looks just the same as the Wandering Ark, actually, I don’t even see either of the two titles referenced inside the game, so basically nothing has changed.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nSame with the gameplay, nothing has changed and it’s literally the same game just under a different name on the Playstore and TapTap. Inside the game, it’s exactly the same.\r\nThe core gameplay of The Wandering Ark/The Pixel Ark revolves around a 5v5 battle on a rectangular arena, where heroes engage in pinball-style combat. Players set trajectories for their units, launching them to bump into opponents for damage. This unique gameplay mechanic introduces a fresh and enjoyable experience, even if the story is a bit all over the place.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game follows a chapter-ized mainline structure for linear story progression, with additional features like the Nuclear Garden and Dungeons offering varied experiences. The Captain's Battle introduces real-time PvP with leveled heroes for balanced competition.\r\nThe progression system, despite featuring gacha microtransactions, provides a balanced free-to-play experience. Upgrading and progression feel smooth without the presence of energy or stamina elements, making the game enjoyable for both paying and non-paying players. Although if you’re a previous player, there’s a good chance you might have lost your account during the transition to this app.\r\nAs expected in free-to-play games, The Pixel Ark includes gacha microtransactions. While the game leans slightly towards pay-to-win in its PvP component, the overall free-to-play experience remains enjoyable and forgiving. Decent guided hero acquisition in the early hours and non-grindy progression contribute to a positive player experience.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game's interface is well-organized, with clear divisions and concentrated main functions in the main home menu. Performance wise I had no problems on my Snapdragon 888 device, with a smooth and responsive gameplay. I have no qualms about the game’s technical performance, and I did not encounter any noticeable issues while playing, same with my experience on the previous app.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI previously described the game under its former name as having fresh and enjoyable gameplay, with a variety of game modes, and a welcoming experience, especially for free-to-play players. Still true, however, it’s just not acceptable to kill a newly released app just to relaunch the exact same game under a different app without providing a surefire or even an automated way to transfer progress for older players.\r\nThis decision adds a lot of uncertainty to an already uncertain mobile game market where every game can announce an EOS (end-of-service) at any time, as seen in a recent example with the gacha anime game Takt Op. Symphony. I would only cautiously recommend The Pixel Ark if you’re that extremely interested in the concept, and even then, I would advise against spending money and to always assume that this game could go dark again at any time.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/6988817) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft\r\n7.6\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nTomb Raider I-III Remastered is a comprehensive collection that brings together the original three Tomb Raider adventures, complete with all expansions and secret levels, on modern platforms (PC, Xbox, PS, Switch). This definitive collection offers players the chance to experience the classic gameplay of the original titles, now enhanced with modern resolutions, high framerates, and high fidelity textures.\r\nTomb Raider I, II, and III follow the intrepid archaeologist Lara Croft as she embarks on daring expeditions to uncover ancient artifacts and solve mysteries. In this classic trilogy, players will explore exotic locations, solve intricate puzzles, and face off against formidable foes, all while unraveling a narrative that blended mythology, history, and adventure. This remastered collection preserves the essence of these stories while enhancing them with modern graphics and technology, breathing new life into Lara's legendary exploits.\r\nI have fond memories of the classic Tomb Raider games, especially the first three. Admittedly, as a kid, I would have never finished these complex puzzle games without the assistance of my older cousin, to whom I am grateful for showing me the way. My favorite memory? Locking Winston in the freezer. Now, I get to do that again in full 4K resolution and at 144hz (depending on your monitor).\r\n## Pros\r\n- Modern but conservative approach to updating visuals\r\n- Preserves spirit of the classic trilogy in both gameplay and visuals\r\n- Runs at your system’s full resolution and refresh rate\r\n- Seamless switching between retro and modern visuals\r\n## Cons\r\n- Poorly implemented but optional modernized control/camera scheme\r\n- Tank controls has aged poorly\r\n- Lack of graphical settings, including resolution options\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nIn the first game, players assume the role of Lara Croft, an adventurous archaeologist who sets out to recover the legendary Scion artifact. The game's narrative unfolds as Lara travels to various locations around the world, including Peru, Greece, and Egypt.\r\nThe second installment in the series sees Lara embarking on a quest to recover the Dagger of Xian, a powerful artifact with the ability to turn its wielder into a dragon. The game takes players to locations such as Venice, Tibet, and China, as Lara uncovers the secrets of the dagger.\r\nIn the third game, Lara is tasked with recovering four pieces of an ancient meteorite scattered across the globe. This installment introduces a more non-linear approach to gameplay, allowing players to choose the order in which they tackle the game's levels.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe remastered collection features updated graphics and art styles that breathe new life into the classic games. Textures have been reworked to be more detailed but still faithful to the spirit of the original game. The original geometry has been preserved so we still have a blocky world to explore here, just with better visuals and lighting. The FMV scenes have been slightly upscaled as well (looks done by AI), although they still clearly look dated and low quality compared to the rest of the remastered visuals.\r\nThe character models have been redesigned with much more detailed models that look closer to the Legends Timeline graphics. It’s not a full-on remake like Anniversary, nor a remaster that aims to have photorealistic AAA visuals like the newer games, instead, it just updates the classic games to look more modernized and “enough” for players of this day and age. All three games have achieved visual parity and can be treated visually as a single, coherent experience, which is nice.\r\nWith a single button, players can seamlessly switch between retro and modern visuals. However, this feature is more of a novel addition to allow players to compare and appreciate both visual styles, rather than serving as an outright avenue to play the game in retro mode. This is because the switch can be jarring, as the retro game runs at a choppy 30fps with occasional visual artifacts.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay in Tomb Raider I-III Remastered stays true to the original titles, with players navigating Lara through a series of challenging environments, solving puzzles, and engaging in platforming and exploration. It’s essentially the same games through and through, just with updated visuals. All levels are the same, the layout, the controls, the puzzles, secrets, and enemies are all the same. If you have played the original games and still remember it, then you’ll have no problems finding your way again.\r\nExploration is a key aspect of the gameplay, with players navigating Lara through sprawling, often maze-like environments. Puzzle-solving is another important element, with players encountering a variety of puzzles that range from simple lever-pulling tasks to complex environmental challenges. These puzzles often require players to use their wits and observational skills to progress.\r\nThere is no handholding, just like the classic experience. No quest markers, no mini-maps, and no waypoint guidance. The only \"modern\" feature added to guide players are the optional \"Action Indicators,\" where all interactable items will have an exclamation point on them when nearby.\r\nPlatforming plays a significant role in the gameplay as well, with players guiding Lara through precarious jumps, climbs, and obstacles. Precision is key, as mistimed jumps or falls can result in do-overs or even death.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe game preserves the original tank controls of the classic games and supports both controllers and keyboard for play. The controls are exactly as I remember them for both schemes from when I played these games on my PS1 and Pentium 4 PC back then.\r\nThe gameplay also features an alternative modern control scheme, giving players the option to choose between classic Tank controls that mimic the original games and modern controls that offer more fluid directional movement. However, the modern control scheme introduces a host of new problems that were clearly not present in the classic games.\r\nPlatforming and precise jumps have become harder in this mode, and you lose the ability to move in small increments going backward and sideways. Combat is also noticeably harder as the auto-aiming conflicts with the modern movement scheme enemy during combat.\r\nLastly, the camera is borderline broken in this scheme, especially during tight spaces; it almost always works against the player, creating a very jarring experience. Switching back to tank controls does away with most, if not all, of these issues, at the trade-off of, well, going back to the antiquated tank controls.\r\nWhile tank controls in general have aged quite poorly, it's sad to say that they are still the optimal way of playing this collection due to how the game was designed and how poorly the \"modern\" scheme was implemented. If you treat this game as the original experience with tank controls, then there are no issues.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nWith its lightweight resource requirements, the game runs flawlessly. I have no problems running the game at full resolution and FPS, although the game doesn’t have any graphical settings to tweak, not even a resolution option if you ever wanted to play at a non-native resolution on your PC. For example in my case where I have an ultrawide resolution and wanted to play at 16:9. That being said, any modern PC can comfortably run this game, making the lack of graphics settings a minor issue. The remastered collection also includes small enhancements such as subtitles and health bars for bosses, improving the overall accessibility for modern audiences.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nTomb Raider I-III Remastered is perhaps one of the better remasters that has come out in recent times, with its modern but conservative approach to updating its visuals while still preserving the spirit of the classics in both gameplay and visuals. It far surpasses the caliber of the half-hearted efforts we have seen with the GTA Trilogy remaster or perhaps the more recent Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1.\r\nThe attempt at offering a modernized control scheme was poorly implemented, but that's just a failed attempt at a bonus as the game is still playable via the tank controls, which becomes the only barrier of entry in enjoying this game. If you can get past the antiquated controls, the game offers a truly remarkable nostalgic experience for long-time fans while also providing a fresh perspective and a glimpse into a classic for newer players.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7009626) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "NBA Infinite - PvP Basketball\r\n7.9\r\nSports\r\nBasketball\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nNBA Infinite is a mobile basketball simulation game developed by Lightspeed Studios and Level Infinite. The game is designed to rival existing mobile titles such as NBA 2K and NBA Live, offering high-intensity gameplay and realistic AAA visuals across various basketball game formats. The game also features officially licensed NBA players and teams\r\n## Pros\r\n- High-quality AAA graphics\r\n- Diverse gameplay options, including 1v1, 3v3, and 5v5 modes\r\n- Streamlined gameplay modes with an arcade style feel\r\n- Officially licensed NBA players and teams\r\n- Smooth performance, extensive settings, and options\r\n## Cons\r\n- Animations can feel stiff and movement lacks inertia and quickness\r\n- Cannot use real team rosters from the NBA in any game mode\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe developers have prioritized visual fidelity, with detailed player models and immersive lighting the results in AAA-level graphics that can go toe-to-toe with the heavyweights like NBA 2K, whether with mobile or even with consoles. The player models are remarkably detailed, although capturing the likeness of NBA stars is a hit or miss – sometimes it looks uncannily good, and other times it's off the mark.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay of NBA Infinite revolves around a card acquisition system for building and enhancing player rosters, and using these players to participate in a variety of basketball game formats. The game offers diverse PvP options, including 3v3, 5v5, and 1v1 games, allowing players to engage in street-style half-court battles or experience the intensity of 5v5 matches in packed stadiums.\r\nThe game features officially licensed NBA players and teams, but you don’t actually have the option to choose real, existing team rosters from the NBA. Instead, players are required to create and use their own customized rosters to compete against others’. You do get to choose your preferred team for your players’ uniforms. Hopefully we can get a game mode in the future wherein we can play with real team rosters, like in EA FC Mobile or eFootball.\r\nIn the 3v3 and 1v1 formats, you get to control a solo individual player of your choice from your card roster. In the 5v5 Dynasty mode, the gameplay transforms into a 1v1 scenario where you select and control an entire team from your card roster.\r\nThe whole format has been simplified across the board, even the 5v5 matches aren’t in full NBA scale and are just divided into two halves for simplicity purposes. The game features both 3v3 and 5v5 ranked matches as well as unranked 3v3 and 1v1 matches. It also features an additional 3-point contest game mode where you can test your reflexes, as well as a practice/training mode.\r\nMy personal favorite is the 5v5 game mode as I get to control everyone in the team. Your experience may vary in the 3v3 format because some players consistently hog the ball and won’t include their teammates in the game. This results in stretches where you aren't really doing anything aside from slightly moving around. Still, 3v3 will be the go-to mode here whenever you want to team-up with other players or with your friends.\r\nThe offense in this game is slightly exaggerated and leans towards an arcade-style experience. Dunks are far too common, and playing defense can be challenging as players tend to easily get through. However, when a block does happen, it’s almost always an emphatic block that’s always a sight to see.\r\n## 🕹Controls\r\nThe actual gameplay includes both on-ball and off-ball play. Aside from dribbling, passing, and shooting, players also have the option to set screens off the ball, perform crossovers, and execute post-up maneuvers. Players also have access to Exclusive and Dominance Skills – unique abilities associated with specific NBA players, such as Tomahawk dunks and Shammgod crossovers – along with perks like long-range blocker and acrobatic airman.\r\nI do find the animations a little bit on the stiff side, there is a lack of inertia in the animations, particularly noticeable during running actions such as shooting, jumping, or even player-to-player interactions. The running speed for all players is slower than usual, and it can sometimes take you out of the immersion. This issue becomes more pronounced when playing a big man with a speed stat of 200+, but it is still noticeable even when playing guards with speed stats of 700+.\r\n## ⏫💵Progression and Monetization\r\nPlayer progression in NBA Infinite is facilitated through a card-based system, requiring multiple copies of individual player cards for enhancements. There is a gacha system for acquiring cards, as well as microtransaction options, but there are still ways to unlock players without spending money, catering to both free-to-play gamers and those open to in-game purchases.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game runs smoothly on my Snapdragon 888 device while still looking amazing. There is an extensive range of graphic settings, and I was able to run the game at the second-best resolution setting and ultra (highest) graphics in general. I also appreciate that they provided two frame rate options for both gameplay and menus. Naturally, the menus default to a low FPS, while I was able to set my gameplay FPS to super. There are three camera settings: one is the popular overhead behind the player view, and the other two are courtside angles, similar to a TV broadcast.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWhile the actual gameplay can feel a bit stiff, sometimes playing like a pre-2010 NBA Live gameplay mechanically, the high-quality AAA graphics and the game’s competitive nature do hide some of these shortcomings in the gameplay. For its first outing, I will give them credit for making a genuine effort to create an NBA game that can rival the big names in the mobile industry. This game lays the groundwork for future improvements that could further solidify its position in the industry.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7007128) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Disney Realm Breakers\r\n5.2\r\nStrategy\r\nTower Defense\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nDisney Realm Breakers is a mobile strategy game that combines elements of tower defense, strategy, and role-playing. The game features a wide array of Disney and Pixar characters that players can collect and use in battle, each with their own unique abilities. Players must strategically build and upgrade their towns, gather resources, and engage in TD and strategy MMO combat to push back the forces of darkness and save Noi.\r\nThe game was made available recently in a soft launch capacity for select regions, including the Philippines, Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia.\r\n## Pros\r\n- A blend of tower defense, strategy, and town building elements\r\n- Wide array of Disney and Pixar characters to collect and use in battle\r\n- Vibrant art style that captures the essence of the Disney universe\r\n## Cons\r\n- Not much depth in its gameplay mecahnics\r\n- The elements seems disjointed from one another and can feel like different games\r\n- Slow pacing and progression, with a heavy reliance on grinding\r\n- Unskippable tutorials that can be annoyingly too handholding and too restrictive\r\n- Laggy experience\r\n## ⭐️Score: 3/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game is set in the enchanting world of Noi, where a seed of \"Disney Imagination\" has landed and brought about a magical tree that, in turn, created Imagination Disney worlds of its own, as well as creatures called Lumins and Luminnies.\r\nThis is a nice explanation of how all the Disney worlds have come together into one and sets the stage for the game's premise, as players are tasked with defending Noi and the other Disney worlds from the dark forces of the Scourge Legion; all while meeting other Disney characters such as Buzz Lightyear and Aladdin. There is a little bit of story here, although it's not a strong point, especially since half of the charm is lost due to the lack of voice-overs, at least not yet in this soft launch.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nThe game's art style captures the whimsical and vibrant nature of the Disney universe, creating an immersive and visually appealing experience that is faithful to the original design of the characters featured here, albeit all translated into stylized 3D form, coming from 2D, 3D, and Live Action. Moreover, the environments in Disney Realm Breakers are equally enchanting, being equally as faithful to the source materials, while introducing new elements such as the world of Noi, The Tree, the Lumins, Luminnies, and the Scourge.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe core gameplay of Disney Realm Breakers revolves around a unique tower defense experience, with added elements of Town building, and strategy MMO mechanics. In general, players must gather resources, expand their towns, and strengthen their defenses to withstand the Scourge's onslaught. For the TD (Tower Defense), the game features two main modes of play: Single Rumbles and Duel Rumbles (PvP).\r\n## 🗼Tower Defense\r\nSingle Rumble introduce a dynamic tower-defense mechanism, requiring players to utilize Luminnies, Heroes, and Abilities strategically to halt enemy advances. You gain stars over time to place units, but you have no control over where or what unit to deploy, but it doesn't matter anyway, as there is no range restriction. Identical shaped units can be combined with each other to level up and this can be done manually or automated.\r\nEach unit type is commanded by a Disney character or a Lumines Knight, which are unfortunately not present in battle but can activate special abilities at your command. There is a timer that you need to survive, where at this point a random boss will spawn in the end that you’d have to defeat to clear the level.\r\nThe system sounds confusing at first but it becomes somewhat digestible after a few minutes of play. There’s not much depth in it because you have no control over the units and even its placement, so it all boils down to using your resources as quickly as possible, either deploying troops, activating especially abilities, or using to boost your units’ stats.\r\nDuel Rumbles follows the same unit placement format, but you now have two defenders with their own sets of attackers. The objective is to survive longer than your opponent by deploying units strategically to impede the enemy's advance. As you defeat enemies on your field, they are sent to the enemy's lane, potentially overwhelming them if you can defeat enemies quickly.\r\n## 🏰Strategy MMO and Town Building\r\nThe game's strategic depth is further enhanced by its Strategy MMO and Town Building elements, allowing players to place structures, upgrade their “Town Hall”, recruit troops, team up with allies and participate in battles in the outside overworld. Players must gather resources, expand their towns, and strengthen their defenses to withstand the Scourge's onslaught. Building and upgrading structures not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the town but also provides strategic advantages, such as increasing resource production or unlocking new abilities. However, this element feels a little disjointed from the TD gameplay, and sometimes they tend to feel like two different games slapped into one.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game features live service elements, including a gacha system for acquiring heroes and knights, as well as an energy system to limit play. Overall, the pacing and progression are quite slow. It takes a long time to even see and more so use other characters from the Disney franchise. Progressing through the levels feels like a grind, with most of the early experience focusing on the Aladdin universe only; Toy Story being the next. Even if you roll new characters with the gacha system, you still can’t use them if you don’t advance the story. Instead of giving us three Aladdin characters to start, a more varied selection of Disney characters available at the outset would have been better.\r\nI also have a problem with the game’s seemingly neverending tutorials. It is annoying that is too hand-holding and prolonged, even locking me up on what I can do, after hours of playing. This unskippable, inescapable tutorial treats players like they are babies.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nMy experience in the game is somewhat laggy, despite setting the game to a 'high frame rate' option in the graphics settings, which is unacceptable given the light nature of the visuals. I also experience some bugs with the tutorials locking me out of the game requiring a restart to fix. Outside these issues, the game seems to be mostly stable.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nIn Disney Realm Breakers, players encounter a blend of tower defense, town building, and strategy MMO elements, although these components can sometimes feel disjointed, and progression feels very slow. While the tower defense mode offers unique mechanics, they may come across as weird and lacking depth. Moreover, the tutorials can be quite annoying in their persistence throughout the game, and the laggy performance is somewhat disappointing, All in all, this results in a game that has failed to be uplifted by Disney's magic, and is mediocre at best in its current state.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7011571) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "title": "Is this really THE Genshin Impact Killer? | CBT2 Review - Wuthering Waves",
    "description": "Wuthering Waves 9.2 Editors' Choice Action PC Version",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "## ✨Overview\r\nWuthering Waves is an upcoming open-world action RPG that promises to deliver a rich open world experience for players on both mobile and PC. It features a anime inspired cel-shaded character designs blended with a mix of stylized AAA high fidelity visuals, and is set in a post apocalyptic world ravaged by the Calament, a catastrophic event that nearly wiped out humanity, Wuthering Waves presents players with a vast and diverse landscape to explore, filled with mysteries to uncover, activities to partake in, and challenges to overcome.\r\nThe game is currently in a closed beta test “CBT2” for select invitees, which started yesterday Feb 19, 2024. Note that this game review only provides a general impression based on the closed beta test and may not be representative of the eventual final version of the game.\r\n## ⭐️CBT Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story of Wuthering Waves unfolds in a world struggling to recover from the devastation caused by the Calament. Players will take on the role as a mysterious amnesiac newcomer known only as the \"Rover,\" and are thrust into a world teeming with danger and intrigue. The main character's amnesia adds an intriguing layer to the narrative, as both players and the main character are blissfully unaware of what is happening, uncovering their past and the role they play in the world's future both at the same time, as the story unfolds.\r\nThe premise of the game is built around the idea of survival and renewal, as players navigate through a society on the brink of collapse, forging alliances, uncovering secrets, and ultimately shaping the fate of humanity. This is actually a revamped story, which is estimated to be 90% rewritten from the original story that testers got during the last closed beta test (CBT1). In that previous version, almost every character we meet is hostile or very suspicious of the player, but in this version, many characters are now friendly, and there are fewer fetch quests ingrained in the story progression.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art Presentation\r\nWuthering Waves blends cel-shaded and realistic graphics to create a visually stunning world that is both vibrant and immersive. It looks awfully a lot like Genshin Impact at the outset, but that's simply a testament to the high-quality visuals that cel-shaded games can achieve. Character designs are detailed and expressive although lacking some variety for now and some of the faces look very similar with each other. On the other hand, landscapes are breathtakingly beautiful, and the visuals effects are impressive, even on low settings on mobile.\r\nThe background music is also relaxingly soothing and well made, though it can be a little too relaxing that you can probably fall asleep listening to it. The game is heavy on cutscene presentation that feels like you’re watching an anime at times, adding to its immersive experience. However, the amount of dialogue can be a little too much, which, combined with the current lack of voice acting, can make these moments feel tedious and boring to experience in this CBT. Fortunately, the developers have said they will add voice dubs in the future. There is a skip option but unfortunately it isn’t present on some occasions requiring players to sit through some dialogue for some reason, some of which aren’t really important to the story.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe game features a variety of gameplay mechanics, including exploration, combat, puzzle-solving, and side-activities, all of which are seamlessly integrated into the game's narrative and open-world. Players can interact with NPCs, complete quests, and discover hidden secrets as they journey through the game world. But perhaps the main attraction is the combat system, which again is reminiscent of games like Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact, with a mix of basic attacks, skills, character swapping, and ultimates that players can unleash on their foes. If you didn’t know anything about the game, you’d think this is another Hoyoverse game, actually.\r\nCombat in Wuthering Waves is fast-paced and exciting, with a focus on fluidity and strategy. Players can switch between characters to create powerful combos and take down enemies, as well as absorb creatures around the world ala-Pokemon to use them as unique ability summons called Echoes. The current combat and movement systems overall feel polished, offering smooth animations and satisfying skills that are visually appealing. The dodge mechanic is very forgiving, adding to the fluidity of combat, and ofcourse there is a wide variety of skills to choose from. However, there are some minor issues with stiffness, particularly in movement and jumping, which was exacerbated by the game’s currently unoptimized performance, that could be improved upon.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nThe game allows players to choose their desired gender and name their main character, who becomes another character that can be used alongside the other characters, many of which are acquired via gacha means. The main character that you create can be swapped out with other characters during combat and exploration for gameplay reasons, and is not required to be present in the team lineup. However, they will always appear and play a central role in the cutscenes and dialogue.\r\nProgression in Wuthering Waves is tied to both character development and story progression and features a typical gacha RPG progression. As players complete quests and defeat enemies, they will earn XP and loot that can be used to improve each of their characters' abilities and equipment. The game also features a crafting system, allowing players to create new items and gear to enhance their characters' abilities further.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nWhile the foundations for monetization and the gacha system are present in Wuthering Waves, purchases are currently disabled in the closed beta testing phase. However, the prices for in-game purchases have already been set. The current gacha system in place seems quite fair and player-friendly so far. It offers a variety of banners for characters and weapons, each with their own pull and pity rates — Very similar to Genshin’s style, and in a player friendly way. As Wuthering Waves is currently in its closed beta testing phase, future points of contention may revolve around how the game's content is rolled out to players, particularly concerning its final monetization and gacha rates.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nI played Wuthering Waves entirely on mobile to provide a realistic experience and set expectations for readers. This allowed me to immerse myself in the mobile experience as much as possible, as PC performance tends to be superior anyway due to its higher power.\r\nIn terms of performance, Wuthering Waves was playable on my Snapdragon 888 phone (ROG Phone 5), but the performance was less than optimal. The game only achieved around 20+ FPS in most cases with huge performance spikes, even on almost lowest settings. Additionally, there were minor visual and animation bugs present, as well as the aforementioned lack of voice-overs, all which are expected in a beta testing phase. Overall, the game's performance is generally playable with no major issues affecting gameplay, but further optimizations are really needed.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nThe term \"Genshin Impact killer\" is often overused online to describe games that have the potential to challenge Genshin's dominance or just to plainly attract clicks. Personally, I rarely use the term, despite having reviewed some gacha games myself. However, in the case of Wuthering Waves, it truly feels like a game inspired by Genshin Impact for all the right reasons and the term felt appropriate for me to use. The combat is already enjoyable, the game feels compelling, player-friendly, and the developers have demonstrated their commitment to the game with a 90% story rewrite based on feedback. With the right strategy from the developers and a favorable market, it has the potential to rival Genshin Impact's success.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7029262) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Rainbow Six: SMOL - NETFLIX\r\n6.3\r\nAdventure\r\nAction\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nRainbow Six SMOL is a top-down isometric roguelite shooter developed by Ubisoft. It features a very whimsical take on the Rainbow Six universe, with adorable, cartoonish graphics and fast-paced gameplay. Released on iOS and Android for Netflix Subscribers, the game offers a cute and perhaps an unexpected spin on the tactical shooter franchise.\r\nUbisoft has found ways to inject personality into the operator characters of Rainbow Six Siege, perhaps a little too much, as these characters now exist in a larger universe beyond Siege, appearing or crossing over in other media such as but not limited to the open-world shooter Ghost Recon, survival horror Dead by Daylight, coop shooter Rainbow Six Extraction, and now, in a rogue-like, cute version of the Rainbow Six universe wrapped up as a mobile game.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Faithful adaptation of Rainbow Six operator abilities\r\n- Destructible environments\r\n- Fast-paced gameplay with tactical depth\r\n- Unique rogue-lite elements\r\n- Cute whimsical art style\r\n## Cons\r\n- Occasional lag that needs more optimization\r\n- Minor visual bugs\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story of Rainbow Six SMOL is simple. Players control a squad of R6 operators who are suddenly magically transported into the land of SMOL, which is under threat from terrorists, conveniently a job suited for the Rainbow Six Operators. It's up to the operators to clear the land of SMOL and defeat the terrorists, all while navigating the game's charming and lighthearted world. That's basically all we need to know, as the game does away with the plot and jumps straight into the chaotic top-down shooter rogue-lite action.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nRainbow Six SMOL features adorable graphics that transform the gritty, realistic visuals of Siege into a childish art style resembling a cartoonish sketch, combined with low-poly 3D. The presentation is top-notch, from the missions to the combat visuals, all being flashy and lively while maintaining a lighthearted feel.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nGameplay in Rainbow Six SMOL is fast-paced and engaging, with a focus on twin-stick combat with autoshooter elements and rogue-lite progression. Players control a main character accompanied by squad of R6 operators, each with their own unique abilities and weapons, as they take on various missions around the land of SMOL.\r\nIn typical Rainbow Six Siege fashion, the game features highly destructible environments, allowing players to approach each mission from basically all sides. Additionally, the game's roguelite mechanics add an element of challenge and replayability, as players must carefully survive the operations and make strategic decisions to succeed.\r\nThe goal is to clear the whole Land of SMOL. Each territory is divided into groups of levels that you need to progress through, with a branching choices of missions. There are different types of missions, including rescuing hostages, bomb defusal, machine defense, assassinations, and more, all in typical Rainbow Six fashion. You are still breaching and clearing mostly throughout the levels, and it's a very fast-paced and fun roguelite twin-stick shooter.\r\n## ⏫Rogue-lite Progression\r\nEach run — called operations, allows players to accumulate tactical patches (skills and modifiers), recruit companion operators, gather coins, level up their current character class, and ultimately clear the whole map. After every run, you go back to your home base to regroup, upgrade, and unlock new things.\r\nWhen you die, you only lose your character's current skill points, but there is still progression retained as the levels completed will stay cleared. Additional persistence comes in the form of unlocking new powers in a talent tree called Books of Powers, as well as rescuing operators across the map to use as companions. The operators are taken from the Rainbow Six Siege games and are mostly based on their unique abilities in this iteration. For example, Sledge still breaks down walls, Castle deploys walls, Valkyrie recon's behind walls, and more.\r\nOverall, the game is a blast to play, but there is a slight difficulty as you can easily die from random hazards or powerful one-hit-kill melee enemies if you're not paying enough attention. Fortunately, the game is very forgiving. The pacing of levels is fast and bite-sized, although there is a lot of unskippable loading and flashy presentation in between missions that may test your patience during continuous do-overs and reruns.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game offers a variety of graphical options, (performance and low frame rate modes) and even includes an immersive haptic feedback option (vibration/rumble) while playing. On my Snapdragon 888 device (ROG Phone 5), The game is a bit laggy despite its lightweight visuals, with a bit of minor visual bugs appearing on screen. However, it does a great job of maintaining itself amidst minimizing and multitasking, and it does not close unexpectedly. The game also runs offline and does not include any in-app ads, purchases, or any live service elements.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but Rainbow Six SMOL captures the spirit of Rainbow Six to a certain degree with its faithful use of operators, destructible environments, and Siege inspired gameplay elements. Its has a cute whimsical art style, fun fast-paced gameplay, and unique rogue-lite mechanics that make it a compelling game to play, even without the Rainbow Six name attached to it. It's a game that any mobile gamer (with a Netflix subscription) will probably enjoy, especially if they’re a bit open-minded and won’t mind a weird take on the Rainbow Six franchise.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7036330) Originally posted on TapTap.",

Set in a futuristic universe, the game puts players in the role of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war with different factions.\r\nThe game is finally now available on mobile devices, featuring crossplay and progression. The iOS port was released last February 20, 2024, while an Android port is currently in development, offering players the chance to enjoy the game on the go, while maintaining their progress towards any platform they want to play in and being able to play with anyone.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Seamless cross-play and cross-progression\r\n- Mobile-friendly features like touch controls and automated attacks\r\n- Fun fast-paced mobility-based gameplay\r\n- Deep customization options\r\n- 11 years worth of updates\r\n- Graphics and art style that hold up to today’s standards\r\n- Full Controller Support\r\n## Cons\r\n- Potential sluggish performance on older devices\r\n- Minor UI/text visibility issues\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 📊Technical Performance (Mobile Port, Controls, Performance, Visual Quality)\r\nSince this is an Mobile port of a rather impressive online game on PC, I opted to discuss this first for those curious about how the port is, and my verdict is that its… Playable, but it will need more optimizations or a relatively new Apple device to be able to fully enjoy. If you’re looking for a more general review of Warframe, feel free to skip these parts.\r\nPlaying the game on mobile, it offers a surprisingly robust experience for a mobile port of such a technically impressive AAA game. As said earlier, one of the best features of Warframe is its cross-play and cross-progression functionality. Something that other franchises like Call of Duty or PUBG have failed to pull off. This functionality is similar to how crossplay works in Genshin Impact, supporting PC, Switch, and mobile devices. This means you can play on your PC, then continue playing your character on-the-go with your mobile phone, and then back to PC once you get home.\r\nIn terms of visuals, Warframe Mobile does a great job of translating the game's stunning graphics to the mobile experience. There is a noticeable downgrade in resolution and textures compared to the PC version, including pixelated looking text and fonts, the game also does not account yet for the Notch of iPhones so some parts of the UI will be cut off. If your device is capable and you turn up the settings though, the graphics are beautiful and can compete with its PC version.\r\nMy experience sadly fluctuated between playable and sluggish on my iPhone 13 depending the size of the level. So, I would recommend playing on a higher-spec'd iPhone device, such as the newer iPhone 15 Pro or the latest iPad Pro sporting the powerful M2 chip. It's also surprising that the game does not support Macbooks unlike other recent ports like Death Stranding or Resident Evil 4, especially with their more powerful M chips.\r\nOne additional concern arises regarding the current ability to host on iOS devices. Given the nature of mobile gaming and the likelihood of interruptions like phone calls or notifications, there may be challenges with hosting game sessions on iOS devices unlike to those on PC or Switch.\r\n## 🕹Mobile Controls\r\nThe mobile port is predominantly designed to play with touch controls and as such many accessibility features have been implemented. Accessibility settings like auto-attack and auto-fire are available to make gameplay easier on the touch controls and limited screen real estate of mobile devices, as well as a “sensor ring” to provide 360 directional warning indicator for enemies. Bullet jump gets its own dedicated touch button to simplify movement, which is a huge help in traversal. The game also features full controller support and automatically switches to a gamepad scheme once detected, making it play the same as the PC or the Switch versions.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nAs for Warframe itself across all platforms, the premise is set in a distant future where the solar system is dominated by various factions. Players take on the role of the Tenno, powerful ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war with the Grineer, Corpus, Infested, and Sentients, among others.\r\nCentral to the story is the Lotus, a mysterious guide who helps the Tenno navigate the dangers of the solar system. As players progress, they uncover the true nature of the Warframes, powerful suits of armor that grant the Tenno their abilities, and the secrets of the Orokin, an ancient civilization that once ruled the solar system.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nDespite being an 11-year-old game, Warframe boasts stunning graphics that hold up even by today's standards. The game features highly detailed character models, intricate environments, and impressive special effects. The art style is a blend of futuristic and ancient themes, creating a visually distinct universe that feels both familiar and otherworldly. This art style is consistent among all platforms including the newly released mobile version.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nYour character’s goal is to protect the solar system from threats and maintain balance, often through combat and espionage missions. Along the way, they encounter various characters, factions, and mysteries that add depth to the game's lore and story.\r\nOne of my favorite features of Warframe is its fast-paced, mobility-based third person gameplay, which sets it apart from other games in the genre. You’re literally controlling a cyborg ninja with powerful abilities zooming around the map with other players and completing missions with haste. Players can also traverse the game's vast open world environments with acrobatic maneuvers, engaging in intense combat encounters and completing missions solo or with friends.\r\nCombat in Warframe is fluid and engaging, with a focus on mobility and acrobatics. Players can perform a variety of moves, such as sliding, jumping, and wall-running, to outmaneuver enemies. The game's combat system is deep and satisfying, with a wide range of weapons and abilities to choose from.\r\n## ⏫Progression and Monetization\r\nWarframe offers a deep and grind heavy but rewarding progression system, allowing players to level up their Warframes and weapons, unlock new abilities, and customize their gear. The game also features a crafting system, allowing players to create new weapons and items using resources collected during missions. Warframe is completely free-to-play across all platforms, with monetization primarily coming from the sale of the premium currency Platinum. Platinum can be used to purchase cosmetic items, weapons, and Warframes.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nWith crossplay and cross-progression support, Warframe Mobile seamlessly integrates with the existing Warframe ecosystem, allowing players to continue their journey across platforms without missing a beat. With its added mobile-centric features such as touch controls and gamepad support, as well as a host of welcome accessible features, Warframe Mobile is an essential addition for fans, complementing the PC experience with an on-the-go mobile experience; while being a compelling choice for newcomers — especially mobile gamers — offering hours of engaging gameplay, as long as your device is powerful enough to handle it.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7037338) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "BROK the InvestiGator\r\n8.7\r\nAction\r\nAdventure\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nBROK the InvestiGator offers a unique blend of classic style adventure, beat 'em up, and RPG elements set in a futuristic world where animals have replaced humans. As Brok, an anthropomorphic alligator private detective and former boxer, players are placed in a \"light cyberpunk\" setting, balancing life under a protective dome with the struggles of the outside world.\r\nBROK the InvestiGator is available on multiple platforms, including PC (Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. I was able to play the first chapter for free, and the subsequent chapters are available for purchase, either separate or in a discounted bundle.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Engaging story with intriguing premise / mystery\r\n- Unique blend of genres (classic style point-and-click adventure, beat 'em up, RPG)\r\n- Stunning cartoon art style with vibrant colors\r\n- Strong voice acting performances\r\n- Very inclusive accessibility features, even for those visually impaired\r\n- Coop up to four players\r\n- Physical controller support\r\n## Cons\r\n- Excessive useless dialogue can slow the pacing of investigations\r\n- Clunky combat touch controls\r\n- The main character is insufferably dumb, and he knows it\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story revolves around Brok and his stepson Graff, as they navigate the aftermath of Brok's wife's mysterious death. They are living in the slums, far from the lush and progressive world offered by ‘The Dome’, although bits of futuristic tech are still available for these unfortunate people. The premise sets a compelling stage for a gritty detective tale, though the excessive dialogue at times can hinder the pacing.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nVisually, BROK is a good looking game thanks to its colorful cartoon art style. The vibrant colors and cartoonish art style give the game a unique and professional look. The character designs are especially noteworthy, adding depth to the game's world. The game also features strong voice acting performances that carries the whole narrative, especially Brok. Every dialogue in the is fully voice, even analyzing simple items in the world all have voice-overs.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay features a mix of point-and-click exploration, puzzles, platforming, beat ‘em up combat, and a unique interrogation mini-game for NPCs. In one segment you may be investigating and trying to find a way to unlock a door, in another you may be fighting thugs in the streets out to get you. To help the player, the control schemes are separate into two modes: Adventure and Action mode, and you can seamlessly switch between them on the fly.\r\nAdventure mode allows you to interact with world objects and investigation, while Action mode allows you to Run, Jump, Defend, and Attack. This variety keeps the gameplay fresh, though the execution could be smoother, especially with the controls coming to mobile phones.\r\nThe game also supports coop play with multiplayer controllers connected, up to four players. The other players will control Brok’s friends, and allow them to roam around together and help each other during combat. It’s a pretty unique feature that’s actually the first time I’ve seen pulled off in a classic-style point-and-click adventure game.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nCombat in BROK is a bit of a mixed bag. While the beat 'em up elements were fun, the controls can be clunky, both in point-and-click and virtual joystick mode. This made combat more challenging than it needed to be. Physical controller support is highly recommended though I would have loved if the touch controls for combat were improved.\r\n## 🕵Detective Work\r\nThe main element of BROK is the detective/investigative work. Collecting clues, combining them, and making choices that impact the story added depth to the gameplay and made me feel like a true detective. However, the main character can be somewhat insufferable, and his perceived dumbness can be off-putting.\r\nAs said earlier, there is too much dialogue while investigating which hurts the pacing; the characters talk excessively, and most of the time you can’t do anything else while they are speaking. Even simple tasks like analyzing a trivial item are accompanied by too many lines of gibberish. It would have been nice to allow the player to move and look around while characters are speaking.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance and 🦽Accessibility Options\r\nThe game ran perfectly on my system (Snapdragon 888) and doesn’t need any online connection. As far as this aspect of the port goes, it was handled very well, although the game only runs at 16:9 and just displays a wallpaper on the sides instead of black bars. BROK also excels in terms of accessibility. With features like narration, haptics, and adjustable font sizes, the game is designed to be inclusive. The developer's commitment to making the game playable by blind or visually impaired players is truly commendable, as they are claiming the game is fully playable with these in mind.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nOnly finished the free Chapter 1 so far, which is already around two hours of content. It’s already compelling enough that I played straight for two hours without putting it down. While it has its flaws, such as excessive dialogue and challenging combat controls, its strong points, including its art style, voice acting, and variety of gameplay mechanics, make it a game worth trying out.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7040316) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Last Epoch\r\n8.5\r\nAction\r\nRPG\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nLast Epoch is an action role-playing game (ARPG) developed by Eleventh Hour Games. This indie title features a pretty cool time-traveling mechanic, allowing players to explore different eras and alter the course of history. The game features a deep character customization, with a variety of classes and skill trees to choose from, as well as a robust crafting system. Players can embark on quests, battle hordes of enemies, and collect powerful loot as they unravel the mysteries of the world of Eterra — past, present, and future. Last Epoch was released on February 22, 2024, after nearly five years in Early Access.\r\nOver the past weekend, I played a lot of Last Epoch, and I am loving it! I have played my fair share of ARPGs over the years, and now it seems that the genre is as strong as ever. I’ve tried the gritty indie Grim Dawn, the ultra-complicated and hardcore Path of Exile, the aged classic Diablo II, and the modern casual experiences in Diablo III and IV. I even tried mobile titles like Diablo Immortal, Torchlight Infinite, and Raziel. So, believe me when I tell you, Last Epoch is the real deal. Even though I love ARPGs, I actively avoided this game for the past five years since it was still in Early Access, and I guess my wait is finally paying off.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Compelling time-traveling story elements and mechanic\r\n- Deep character customization, skill trees, and crafting system\r\n- Stunning AAA-like visuals for an indie title\r\n- Accessible respec system\r\n- Smooth progression and leveling\r\n- Offline mode possible\r\n## Cons\r\n- Controller support is a bit buggy\r\n- Online mode is borderline unenjoyable due to server overloads (as of writing)\r\n## ⭐️Score: 9/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe story begins with a seemingly straightforward and clichéd premise: a world created by a long-forgotten God, now governed by her descendants who are embroiled in a war amongst themselves.  However, the story quickly takes a more complex and deep turn as the players find themselves thrust into the midst of this conflict, and are tasked with saving time itself from The Void by traveling through different moments of time in the world of Eterra. Along the way, they will face dark empires, wrathful gods, and untouched wilds, uncovering secrets and unraveling the mysteries of the world.\r\nThe time travel angle, which isn’t used very much in games, is pulled off very well in Last Epoch. It allows you to travel back and forth through multiple time periods, and it is compellingly integrated into the story where characters will recognize you and your powers, and your ability to affect the future. It’s also fun to travel around the same world, seeing places in different states, depending on the timeline. Last Epoch also features themes of multiverses and multiple worlds alongside its time travel elements.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nLast Epoch is stunningly good for an indie game. The game features a detailed and vibrant art style that brings the world of Eterra in a believable and immersive way. The environments are well crafted, from lush forests to icy wastelands, each with its own unique atmosphere and charm. The orchestral soundtrack is also amazingly made that  you wouldn’t even think that it’s an indie title with how good it is produced and sounds.\r\nThe character and enemy designs are equally impressive, with a variety of creatures and monsters that are both menacing, not only in the looks but also in how they sound. The spell effects and animations are also top-notch, adding to the overall spectacle of the game just like what you would expect from an ARPG game.\r\nIt seems to draw heavy inspiration from Diablo III and Diablo IV in its menu design, including the mini-map, HUD placement, sound bites, and general aesthetic all throughout the game. Despite being an indie game, it can hold its own against AAA titles like Diablo IV in terms of visuals, voice acting, and overall in-game presentation. However, not all dialogue is voice-acted in the game.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nNow to the gameplay, Last Epoch is a typical ARPG game from the outset. Choose a character class, kill some monsters, progress through the story, unlock new skills, loot powerful gear, rinse and repeat. However what makes this game special aside from the unique time travel aspect is with how it handles its ARPG mechanics, and all the other little things.\r\nThere are five classes — Mage · Rogue · Primalist · Acolyte · Sentinel —  which underwhelmed me at first, but the game does a great job of informing the player that each of these five classes can actually split into three more as they progress, resulting in 15 classes in total, which covers most bases as far as typical ARPG classes go. Personally, my favorite class in ARPGs is mage, and if possible, a sword-wielding mage, which aligns perfectly with the game’s Spellblade specialization — although I’ve tried other classes and builds as well. All five classes have predetermined character models, and you will not be able to customize their appearance aside from their clothes/armor.\r\n## ⏫Progression\r\nAs you play more, skills will unlock for your character and every single skills will have their own deep skill trees, which feels like a super-expanded version of Diablo III’s rune system or Diablo IV’s nodes system — although not as overly complicated as Path of Exile’s rotating skill tree of epic proportions. The progression of Last Epoch feels smooth, and leveling up takes just the right amount for my tastes; it doesn’t feel grindy compared to most ARPGs.\r\nLast Epoch also features a fun and accessible respec system, which is not as unforgiving and restrictive as Path of Exile and not as basic as Diablo. With only a minor setback, you can easily respec everything except the character class master specialization, which seems fair enough.\r\nThe crafting system also plays a significant role in progression, as players can craft powerful items to enhance their abilities. It’s a little bit harder to understand than the rest of the mechanics, considering how deep it is and highly customizable with how you can modify the item’s affixes, reroll them, or perhaps create new ones.\r\nIn Last Epoch, the main endgame centers around the Monolith of Fate, offering players the chance to explore alternate timelines and echoes of events. Each timeline has its own quest, echoes, and boss to defeat, rewarding players with permanent Blessings that enhance their character's power or improve loot drops.  This mode is already accessible early in the game's story, which is nice as you don't need to beat the campaign to access it.\r\nAdditionally, there are the dungeons, that offer another endgame activity, each with its own mechanics, bosses, and rewards, and an Arena mode that provides a wave survival gameplay where players face endless waves of enemies, testing their skills and endurance.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe skill system allows for a great deal of customization in combat, with players able to mix and match skills from different trees to create powerful combinations. The combat itself is fast-paced, satisfying, with impactful animations and effects that make each encounter feel dynamic and exciting.\r\nIt does not feature ragdolls though, a complex physics system for destructible environments, or kinematic-based combat. (All underrated features that I always appreciate when playing Diablo). However, what they have is sufficient to showcase the characters' power without feeling as stiff as Diablo II or Path of Exile.\r\n## 📜Personal Favorite Features\r\nAside from the usual ARPG goodness, Last Epoch also includes innovations that push the genre in a positive direction. One of my personal favorites is how you could push mobs slowly while moving, so you don't get stuck or get your movement pathing affected by enemies compared to other ARPGs. Mana use is also more forgiving, allow a negative value, basically giving you one additional cast at the trade off of having a negative mana value.\r\nAnother favorite of mine is the additional of a customizable loot filter, something that even Diablo IV has failed to implement with its millions of AAA budget. Not to mention the abundance of stash space (over a hundred) and character slots (25)\r\n## 🕹Controller Support\r\nThe game is optimally designed for mouse and keyboard controls, but there is support for controllers, although it needs more work and refinement. It’s not as intuitive as I expected, especially compared to other ARPGs with controller support, and it sometimes bugs out, requiring me to re-initialize the controls by switching to keyboard/mouse and then back to the controller.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nIn terms of technical performance, Last Epoch is solid overall. The game runs smoothly on most systems, with minimal lag or stuttering. It runs on my RTX 3080 PC, GTX 1650 Laptop, and Steam Deck (with visibility issues with how small the texts are).\r\nThere are some very rare crashes and sudden FPS drops in effects-heavy scenes, but overall, the experience is stable and smooth. However, there is a \"suffering from success\" situation currently, as the game’s servers are overloaded from the release up to the present. Therefore, a lot of my experience was actually in offline mode to ensure I had zero disconnects, lags, and queue times.\r\nRegarding the much-welcomed offline functionality, I may sound ungrateful for saying this, but the game also needs peer-to-peer co-op for offline mode players/characters. If you find online mode is too restrictive, especially if you want to play the game on-the-go or at your own leisure without dependency on server latency, still want multiplayer, it would be nice to still be able to play co-op casually with friends or people in a peer-to-peer setup.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nLast Epoch is not without its flaws; controller support is buggy, optimization can still be improved, and servers are currently overloaded. But even with these current issues, Last Epoch is already a remarkable action RPG that successfully combines a compelling story with a ‘deep enough but not too deep’ gameplay mechanics that strike the perfect balance between depth and accessibility. For ARPG fans who have explored too many titles looking for that addicting fix, Last Epoch offers a refreshing and fulfilling experience that ticks all the right boxes.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7052726) Originally posted on TapTap.",

The game offers a distinctive twist on combat mechanics, not allowing players to damage enemies directly but instead requiring the use of other contraptions. It challenges players to survive a jungle filled with man-eating tribes as a young potato. For those wondering, yes, it is made by the same makers of the excellent rogue-lite Brotato (hence the Potato theme).\r\nThe game is set to release on Android and iOS this year, expected in March, with a Closed Beta Test scheduled for Android on Feb 28 as a TapTap Exclusive. I'm fortunate enough to have been given early access to the game, allowing me to provide a preview of what it's like.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique combat mechanic wherein you cannot directly damage enemies\r\n- Charming art style\r\n- Lightweight and runs smoothly on most phones\r\n- Fast-paced and bite sized gameplay\r\n## Cons\r\n-Lack of depth and content\r\n-Lack of proper instructions and tooltips and tries too hard to be minimalistic only to become confusing\r\n-Unfairly spawns the player in tight spots sometimes\r\n## ⭐️Score: 6/10\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nLost Potato: Premium shares that distinctive look of Brotato, featuring a charming and clean cartoonish 2D art style that is reminiscent of classic flash games of the 2000s. The graphics are simple yet effective, with clean color palettes and cartoonish character designs that add to the game's charm. Thanks to its lightweight visuals, I think it’s safe to say that this game will definitely run on almost every smartphone out there.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay in Lost Potato: Premium revolves around environmental interactions and strategic thinking. Players cannot damage enemies directly with the swing of their weapon, and they must use bouncing, reflecting, and activating bullets/traps to eliminate enemies, with various environmental hazards like rotating spikes, ground spikes, and ball-spewing plants for the player to use. Each encounter presents a unique challenge, requiring players to think on their feet and adapt to the ever-changing environment.\r\nEach level gets progressively harder, and every now and then you get to pick what traps or bonuses you want to add to your arsenal. You die, you restart back to level 1. As part of the persistent progression, players can unlock 14 ‘hats’, each providing new starting stats or traps, allowing for different playstyles and strategies like an additional starting health or an added focus on a certain trap. Runs take as little as a few seconds to a few  minutes only, making it easy to pick up and play on the go. The game also features randomly generated levels and upgrades, so there is a bit of replayability.\r\nHowever, there's not much content in the game, and you'll likely see everything you want to see within an hour of play. However, this doesn't mean it's only worth an hour of playtime. It all comes down to whether you find the gameplay loop fun, challenging, and entertaining. Personally, I find the game lacking and has failed to sustain my interest to more than an hour of play. There is simply not much depth aside from unlocking and choosing other ‘hats’ that affect starting stats/traps.\r\nI also have a problem with how the game spawns you in tight spots at the start of levels, giving you only a few seconds to position yourself properly. It's hard to spot your character, so sometimes the time is not enough, resulting in situations where they take damage unfairly or without proper preparation.\r\nThe game also lacks instructions and proper tooltips to explain the mechanics. While I appreciate the attempt to be minimalistic by only showing things visually with icons, it just doesn’t work here and it confused me.\r\nStill, I had fun while it lasted, especially when testing out different traps and trying out the best strategy on how to win. My favorite moment is probably whenever you deflect bullets, where it can somewhat make you feel like a Jedi deflecting blaster fire.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nDespite its engaging gameplay loop and unique “kill enemies indirectly” mechanics, Lost Potato: Premium falls short in terms of depth and content. Players may find themselves experiencing everything the game has to offer within a short time, leading to a lack of long-term engagement. For $2 though, it’s hard to complain, so if you’re looking for a cheap game for a quick hour or two of enjoyment, then perhaps Lost Potato: Premium might still satisfy your craving.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7052322) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Ex AstrisGlobal\r\n9.0\r\nRPG\r\nSci-fi\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nEx Astris, developed by Hypergryph (developers of Arknights), offers a unique blend of turn-based and real-time gameplay in a mesmerizing 3D world. Unlike the usual gacha offering we usual see from this developer and in mobile games, Ex Astris easily stands out as a one-time purchase premium game, offering a refreshing change of pace, a rarity these days.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique blend of turn-based and real-time gameplay\r\n- Mesmerizing 3D visuals with an anime-inspired style\r\n- Exploration and puzzle-solving elements\r\n- Login only required on starting the game, can play offline afterwards\r\n- One-time payment, no gacha or microtransactions\r\n## Cons\r\n- The storytelling can be confusing and it’s not that compelling\r\n- Limited voice acting and language options (No english voice)\r\n- Combat may feel repetitive in longer play sessions\r\n## ⭐️Score: 8/10\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nPlayers step into the shoes of Yan, an exoplanet investigator with the NOUS WAVE organization, on a mission to retrieve a sample of pure Astrom from the alien planet Allindo. She is then accompanied by a diverse cast of characters, each with their own stories and abilities, as she embarks on an sci-fi adventure filled with beauty and mystery.\r\nIn typical Hypergryph fashion, the initial description and presentation of the game is a bit confusing, ambiguous, and almost nonsensical. You might even think there's something wrong with the translation. But I guess that’s part of the charm. However as you play you get to know more of the lore and the character and it becomes clearer as you play. I have to be honest though, outside the alluring premise of exploring and visiting a beautiful scenic world, the narrative is not very compelling and enticing — especially the first few parts of the game are mostly fetch-like quests.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nEx Astris features mesmerizing visuals featuring an anime-inspired soft 3D style. It's not cel-shaded like most anime games and opts for a more 3D look. The character models themselves aren’t highly detailed, but the impressive lighting effects and beautiful world and environment design more than make up for this. Exploring the world feels relaxing with its dreamy art direction and bright colors, complemented by a soundtrack that fits the theme well. The game is partially voice acted (for crucial scenes only) and is available in both Chinese and Japanese, but there is English text localization available.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nEx Astris features a unique blend of turn-based and real-time gameplay, it’s not pausable real-time, nor a tactics strategy system. It instead offers an entirely fresh take on RPG combat. Front and center is the so-called Obscuran Maneuver System.\r\nThis innovative combat system requires active engagement from the player for both offense and defense. During offensive turns, you need to activate skills in real-time, some of which may include bonus Quick Time Events (QTEs). Defensive turns allow you to switch between characters on the fly to manage incoming damage and activate defensive skills such as dodging or parrying.\r\nYou must manage Action Points (AP) to use skills. Certain skills may restore AP or require AP to use, which ties in to the game’s combos and joint attack feature, encouraging strategic coordination between party members to allow for more attacks per turn. Some party members will have skills that restore AP under certain conditions, so it’s a matter of finding the right combo for your team in order to maximize your attacks per turn. Each enemy also has a guard bar that you can deplete to temporarily stun them, allowing for more attacks.  It does get repetitive in longer play sessions though if you’ve already found what combo works best for you.\r\nEx Astris allows players to have up to three party members with them at all times. Each character offers unique playstyles, abilities, and skill tree system to progress in — encouraging players to strategically switch between them to adapt to different combat situations and maximize their effectiveness in battle. What’s better is because there’s no gacha or microtransactions, everything is easily within your reach just like a normal game! There is no pressure to grind or spend money in this game, aside from the initial asking price.\r\n## 🌍Not just combat\r\nOutside of combat, Ex Astris encourages exploration and puzzle-solving. Even though it’s not a full-on open-world game, there is still a big emphasis on exploration. You'll get to wander across the planet in various ways, and the game is not exactly linear; you can explore levels and areas and uncover secrets. Additionally, players can craft augmentations for their characters, further enhancing their abilities and customization options; or perhaps cook using ingredients gathered from the world, providing stat boosts to players until their next rest.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nUnlike other similar mobile titles, Ex Astris stands out by breaking away from the typical gacha model. Despite its aesthetic and mechanical similarities to gacha games, Ex Astris offers a one-time purchase premium experience. There are no gacha or microtransactions, ensuring that everything in the game is easily accessible without additional costs. (Although DLCs are still possible in the future).  The only thing they could have done better in this case is to provide a chapter 1 demo to better attract players, especially those used in playing free-to-play offerings.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game is playable on my Snapdragon 888 device. I was able to run the game at default settings (mostly medium) but I upped the frame rate setting from 30 to 60 although it does seem to just stays around 30 FPS. There are lag spikes here and there especially when loading new areas, but nothing really game breaking.\r\nUnfortunately, there is no controller support, and the game is only designed with touch controls in mind. The touch controls are well implemented though and it’s perfectly playable in this scheme. Additionally, the game only requires an online connection/login though upon starting the game, but it’s not needed to continue playing. During story and character dialogue, you can skip conversations. However, for some reason, they are not playing automatically, requiring me to click repeatedly to skip every line in the game.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nEx Astris offers a refreshing and captivating RPG experience, blending turn-based and real-time elements in a mesmerizing 3D world. Sure, it’s story is not as compelling as I thought and the performance could be better; but at an upfront cost of $10 for everything, it’s still a bargain. Honestly, I would have given the game a 7 out of 10 score at face value alone as a mobile game. However, I had to give them a bonus point for going against the current and deciding to release this as a one-time payment premium game instead of a live-service gacha offering.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7060189) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "title": "The graphics are decent, but the game itself feels barebones| Review - MerX: Multiplayer PvP shooter",
    "description": "MerX: Multiplayer PvP shooter 6.2 Action Shooter Download",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "6.2\r\nAction\r\nShooter\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nPlaying the game, it looks pretty barebones in appearance at the moment with a basic UI system and presentation. It was just released on Jan 30, 2024 in soft launch capacity. However, due how barebones it looks, I’m actually not sure if the game has actually soft launched or in just a testing phase. Despite this though, the actual graphics are already quite decent, feeling clean, smooth, and detailed.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Decent, modern, stylized 3D graphics\r\n- Simplified combat and gunplay\r\n## Cons\r\n- Feels barebones in its UI and presentation\r\n- Only two maps and one objective to play\r\n- Lack of variety and inspiration in character abilities\r\n- Game performance and online connectivity needs more optimization\r\n- Stingy progression and monetization rates\r\n## ⭐️Score: 3/10\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nMerX boasts modern, stylized 3D graphics that are pretty much standard for any decent AA mobile title. Not too photorealistic and not too pixelated. As far as graphics go, the game delivers clean, smooth, and detailed visuals that is perhaps the main highlight of the title so far. The character designs are varied and interesting, looking especially good, particularly in the menus.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nMerX offers FPS hero shooter gameplay, with players engaging in fast-paced, 4v4 PvP team-based battles. Players can choose from a roster of characters, each with their own shooting style, skills, and perks, which bares similarities to Overwatch both mechanically and visually.\r\nOverall, the gameplay format again feels reminiscent of Overwatch but in the third person. I've only played two maps available in the game (Yucatan Temple and Military Base) with the same game format — capture the objective where you need to control a certain point on the map to gain points. The first team to reach 1000 points wins, while kills also grant 35 points that will help teams reach that ultimate goal.\r\n## ⚔️Combat and Abilities\r\nCombat and gunplay in MerX is simplified, with players only needing to aim as the characters shoot automatically. This simplicity encourages players to focus on strategy and positioning, rather than complex controls that are usually complicated by touch input. However, the high TTK (time to kill) can lead to some pretty awkward moments between opposing teams standing at the capture point trying to eliminate each other. There is also a pretty strong aim assist implemented here that sometimes... gets in the way of what you actually want to aim and fight against the player more often than I liked.\r\nThere are different abilities for each character, such as a rocket launcher that explodes for AOE damage, a burst healing ability, or perhaps a black hole that pulls every enemy to a single spot. Despite this, there's not much variety or versatility in the abilities, and they feel largely uninspired. I feel like they should add more abilities to each character, making them more utility-based. I would also recommend toning down the TTK a little bit.\r\n## ⏫Progression and Monetization\r\nPlayers start with just one character in their pool: the rough soldier McCloud, but will unlock more characters as you play. The first three characters are unlocked pretty quickly, but the others are further down the ‘Trophy Road’ progression and require a lot more games, unless you spend real money to unlock them at will.\r\nThe rates are pretty stingy though, and will require you to spend around $30 worth of gems to unlock one character. There is a skill tree for each character to upgrade stats, such as Health, Ammo capacity, or damage. However, upgrading them is another challenge, as it's a little bit unforgiving to even get the first upgrade going, requiring a heavy grind or easily spending money in the game store.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nPerformance was playable on my Snapdragon 888 device, with the graphics set to medium and FPS at 60fps; I was getting around 40+ FPS. However, I am experiencing some FPS drops from time to time. The game's animations are a bit stiff overall, but the groundwork for a solid shooter is laid, which can be promising with future updates. The game strictly requires an online connection to play, and unfortunately, my connectivity to the servers (I’m from the SEA Region) wasn’t all that smooth, as I consistently got a ping of 300ms or above in most of my sessions. Also, prepare to play with and against bots in this game, especially in your first few games.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nAs it stands, MerX: Multiplayer PvP shooter currently offers nothing noteworthy to really stand out. Sure, its graphics look decent, but the game itself feels barebones and it feels like I’m playingan early testing version right now. There aren't many maps or game modes, and the few abilities of the characters are largely uninspired and lack variety. Add to that the current stingy progression and monetization rates, and the game falls short even of pretty low expectations.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7083261) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Immortal Kingdoms M Playpark\r\n9.2\r\nPre-register\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nImmortal Kingdoms is an upcoming fantasy MMORPG for both mobile and PC. The game promises a variety of gameplay mechanics, including solid idle RPG features that allows players to automate many aspects of the game, as well as traditional MMORPG elements such as PvP, PvE, character progression, and customization.\r\nThe game is not out yet, but I had the opportunity to explore the game this past weekend in a closed internal testing phase, and this is indeed an interesting game to discuss when it comes to its progression and idle game features. The two versions I’ve played are under Indonesian localization and English localization. For players interested in this game, Pre-registration is currently live and on-going on Google Play, and a beta test will probably be announced very soon.\r\n## 📖Story and Premise\r\nThe game is set in a world ravaged by war between kingdoms, and there is really cool CGI at the start of the game showcasing the characters in action to set the mood. However, beyond that, the game understandably isn’t really heavy on the narrative, especially with its focus on Idle gaming (It’s pointless to have a rich story if everybody plays in idle anyway). The game features medieval fantasy elements such as swords, magic, monsters, interweaved with the use of guns (gunpowder fantasy).\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art\r\nImmortal Kingdoms features detailed character models and vibrant open environments. However, its art design and color palette give it a standard MMORPG appearance, reminiscent of games like World of Warcraft or Tarisland, nothing too fancy. The character models, particularly the female characters, have doll-like appearances rather than a more anime or realistic style, which is a bit unusual for me. Overall though, I would say the graphics are on par with leading MMORPG games, offering a visually stunning experience, so far as graphics go, it isn’t lacking.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nImmortal Kingdoms offers a blend of traditional MMORPG elements with an idle RPG format, providing players with diverse gameplay options. The game allows for automated navigation, combat, and farming, making it essentially a large idle RPG within an MMORPG format. Players can choose to automate almost everything in the game, including quests, weapon equipping, and skill activation, allowing for a more relaxed gameplay experience. The game also features a variety of multiplayer options, including both PvP and PvE modes, where players can team up with friends or compete against each other in exciting battles.\r\nThere are five classes to choose from when creating a character in Immortal Kingdoms: Reaper, Slayer, Assassin, Sorcerer, and Gunslinger. Some classes have two genders, while others are locked to one gender. You can customize it’s appearance including its facial features, sizes, colors, and hair styles.\r\nThe Reaper is a fearsome class that wields a scythe and possesses the ability to manipulate life and death. The Slayer is a stalwart class known for their resilience and strength on the battlefield, clad in heavy armor and wielding powerful weapons to excel at absorbing damage and protecting their allies.\r\nThe Assassin is a master of stealth and deception, specializing in quick and lethal strikes. The Sorcerer is a spellcaster who harnesses the power of magic to unleash devastating attacks. The Gunslinger is a skilled marksman who specializes in a wide range of firearms, essentially making the game a gunpowder fantasy. They are deadly accurate with their shots and can take down enemies from a distance.\r\n## ⚔️Combat\r\nThe combat in Immortal Kingdoms follows a typical third-person ARPG format, with real-time combat, skill activation, dodging, and enemy avoidance. While the combat system offers some depth, including the ability to activate skills and perform combos, it may feel repetitive to some players, especially during automated gameplay. Movement is a bit clunky too, which can be frustrating during intense combat situations\r\n## 🕹To Idle or To not Idle?\r\nAlthough the idle gameplay is the main draw, as you can still play the game and control your character as usual, moving the character manually and participating in combat by activating skills yourself. I see some faint semblance to the Souls-like genre in terms of how it plays, but only to a small extent. However, you are really doing yourself a disservice if you ever opt to play this in full manual mode all throughout. I strongly advise playing this game as an idle RPG, with only occasional control of your character if you want to experience some action yourself and experience your characters current power levels from time to time.\r\n## ⏫Progression and Monetization\r\nThe progression system in Immortal Kingdoms is based on quick incremental upgrades and level-ups, providing players with a sense of constant progression and reward. However, the game is also heavy on the grind, requiring players to invest time and effort to get stronger.\r\nBut then again, the game bombards you with a dose of overwhelming progression mechanics that fill your senses with dopamine, thanks to all the quick incremental upgrades and level-ups throughout the game, creating a sense of continuous advancement. It’s essentially the same concept as power creep but applied to the game’s overall progression mechanics. There’s also lots of boss fights, but these can also be automated/idled as long as your player is powerful enough.\r\nThe game is entirely free-to-play but there will be microtransactions and the game will undeniably pressure you to spend money to make your characters more powerful. However, since the game is still in internal testing, details about its monetization model are not yet final.\r\n## 📊Technical Performance\r\nThe game ran pretty well on my Snapdragon 888 device. I just set the graphics to High, FPS to default, and it ran pretty much without problems aside from usual server connectivity issues. As highlighted earlier, the game features a plethora of automation features that basically makes this game an idle RPG that can be play by itself. Although mechanically, it honestly feels early in development in all aspects. It's only in an internal testing phase as of now, so I guess it's acceptable.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nImmortal Kingdoms has integrated idle RPG mechanics into the traditional MMORPG format and the end result is a fun MMO that doesn’t take much effort (or no effort at all) to play and experience. The game's idle features allow players to conveniently automate many aspects of gameplay, such as navigation, combat, and farming, while still maintaining a sense of progression and accomplishment. If you love MMOs and Idle gaming, and this game is worth checking out.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7084239) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "Space Wanted\r\n8.4\r\nAction\r\nSpace\r\nDownload\r\n## ✨Overview\r\nSpace Wanted is a brand new mobile space shooter and warfare game featuring rogue-lite elements and a time survival aspect. As a single-player roguelike experience set in space, players are tasked with commanding a fleet of ships to take down space pirates in intense battles. The game is exclusively available here on TapTap for Android (Mobile) and has just been released.\r\nSpace-themed games are probably my favorite setting in video games and media in general, and I've also developed a newfound love for rogue-lite games in recent years, thanks to a surge of really great titles. So finding out that Space Wanted is a rogue-lite game set in space, where you command a flagship to take down space pirates, makes it a perfect fit for me to try out. It's been fun to play, with multiple game modes, great visuals, and a free-to-play friendly experience.\r\n## Pros\r\n- Challenging rogue-lite/time survival gameplay\r\n- Multiple game modes\r\n- Impressive graphics and visuals\r\n- Free-to-play friendly\r\n- Smooth flawless performance\r\n## Cons\r\n- Aggressive and tempting ad implementation\r\n- Limited variety in weapon and skill types\r\n- Some issues with targeting and damage feedback\r\n## ⭐️Score: 7/10\r\n## 📖Premise\r\nThere is no story in this game; it just takes you right into the gameplay. The premise is pretty clear, though: you command a flagship and a small fleet, trying to take on hundreds of pirates across three distinct game modes. Swarm Uprising offers a series of linear missions to complete, Pirates Revenge is a timed survival game mode, and Plunder War is a turn-based-like fleet warfare mode where you control fleet logistics instead of directly controlling your ships.\r\n## 🎨Visuals and Art, and 📊Technical Performance\r\nEven though the game uses a 2D layout for movement, the 3D graphics are impressive, with detailed ship designs, vibrant special effects, and immersive space environments. Despite being on mobile, the graphics hold up well. The ship designs are what you'd expect from a space-themed game: metallic, greyish, with color highlights to differentiate friend from foe. There's some upbeat background music, but it's not as strong as the visuals. There may be no graphical settings to tweak but it didn’t matter. Despite how decent the game looks, it ran without any issues and I think I was basically on a locked 60fps experience on my Snapdragon 888 device.\r\n## 🎮Gameplay\r\nTwo first two game modes; Swarm Uprising and Pirate Revenge are similar enough; the only big difference is that one is a finishable series of missions, and the other is a never-ending time survival mode that records your high score. Advancing in Swarm Uprising will give you plenty of resources to upgrade your ships and unlock new ones, while Pirate Revenge will provide resources and the opportunity to reach a new high score.\r\nIf you're familiar with Vampire Survivors, then the gameplay of Space Wanted is very similar. You have a ship at the center of the screen firing automatically, waves of pirates come at you, and you have to blast them to survive. Destroying them lets you accumulate coins that will level you up, giving you a choice of three temporary upgrades in typical rogue-lite fashion: like a faster movement speed, better damage, or perhaps an additional skill to use. All weapons are activated automatically, except for the main cannon, which must be aimed and fired manually.\r\nOne major difference with traditional time survival games is that in Space Wanted, targeting is still a big part of the gameplay instead of just focusing on movement. Most of the ship's weapons only shoot from the front, so you have to orient your ship properly to hit enemies. There are two control modes: auto-fire and manual-fire. Auto-fire does what it says, while also auto-aiming at enemies when not moving. Manual fire gives you more control over your ship but requires playing with both hands. The game offers three camera modes: isometric, isometric with a steeper angle, and complete top-down view.\r\nHowever, there are some gripes. I would have liked not having to target in these types of games, and the activation of the main cannon is a bit buggy, sometimes causing me to move while targeting, which can be critical as the game is unforgiving when it comes to taking damage. There's not much feedback to indicate that you're taking damage, and there's not much variety in weapon and skill types, limiting the choices to experiment with different setups. The game is ultimately fun, but I wish there was a bit more depth and experimentation involved in it.\r\nThe last mode, Plunder War, is a much different format. It almost feels like turn-based or tick-based, similar to Eve Online, where you wait for commands instead of directly controlling the ships. Players have a set amount of resources that they can use to deploy ships to destroy and counter the opposing fleet. Yet again, there's not much depth here, and it exists mainly to add variety to the game and provide another way to gain resources.\r\n## 💵Monetization\r\nSpace Wanted is entirely free-to-play but includes microtransactions and optional ads to boost progress. The rewards you get from watching ads are so overpowered that you’d be tempted to watch them, such as doubling the amount of rewards or giving you free revives. Microtransactions also range from completely removing ads to unlocking all ships or providing additional resources. Honestly, I prefer this approach over the usual gacha or grindy approach, but I still found the ads a little bit aggressive.\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion\r\nIf you love space shooter games and rogue-lites, then Space Wanted — with its engaging time survival/rogue-lite gameplay, three game modes, and decent graphics — is definitely worth checking out. Despite some minor issues with targeting, damage feedback, aggresive ads, and the game being somewhat shallow, the game runs smoothly and delivers a fun and challenging experience in a compact bite sized format.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7089330) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "I recently played both games of The Hellblade Saga, starting with Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice first in anticipation of the then-upcoming Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, then playing Hellblade II afterward when it released.\r\nBoth games are available on Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service, so I was able to play both of them for basically free, which is amazing for the newly released Hellblade II.\r\nThe most basic of basics\r\nGameplay wise, both games share the same basic formula: a lot of walking around, intense cinematic and disturbing cutscenes, a little bit of simple but fun combat, and, last but not least, some creative puzzle solving. Almost all of the gameplay components in this game feels basic, but it doesn't stop it from being decent in its own right. Especially since it’s so short-lived, the game ends before it becomes repetitive or boring. Although one might say it’s short length is a downside of its own.\r\nThe puzzles are very simplistic but still unique and creative in design. It's easy to pick up and solve them, but it's still something I haven't seen before in games. Almost all of the puzzles are visual in nature and not something that is spatial (moving blocks) or needs precise movement or fast timing (platforming). Players may need to look closely at the environment to see what they’re missing.\r\nThe games largely share the same combat formula. A typical third person hack and slash gameplay where you can dodge, parry, and hit enemies, but with zero depth and variety; there are no other weapons aside from your sword; no upgrades and progression; nor a selection of abilities and moves. Although to its credit, Hellblade 2 received a substantial upgrade to its combat animations which feel even more lifelike and organic. To the point that I was initially having a hard time figuring out if what I was seeing was a cutscene or am I in actual control of the character.\r\nA visual treat, that comes at a cost\r\nVisually, both Hellblade 1 and 2 were great for their time. Hellblade 1, a game released in 2017 (seven years ago), still holds up very well and can pass as a game released today. It’s probably one of the best-looking Unreal Engine 4 games out there. Of course, a game that old will still show signs of aging, and in my experience, it showed the occasional old-game jank. Lack of accessibility options, occasional stutters, and crashes on my newer system are present.\r\nHellblade 2, on the other hand, leverages the full power of Unreal Engine 5 with enhanced models, lighting, and support for new technologies such as Frame Gen and DLSS, but at the cost of running with absolute dogshit performance. I was only able to run the game at around 30-40 FPS in most heavy scenes on my RTX 3080 rig, thankfully modded with an unofficial Frame Gen tweak so I could experience it above 60. Another thing I disliked, though, is the game’s soft-locked aspect ratio to 21:9, meaning on common place 16:9 displays, there WILL be black bars, like when I tried it on my Xbox Series X.\r\nAt face value, Hellblade 2 is definitely probably one of the best-looking games right now, alongside Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077’s path tracing modes. But I’m not so sure the visuals warrant the heavy performance hits, as both Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk ran relatively decently compared to Hellblade 2.\r\nStrongest points: storytelling and presentation\r\nThe storytelling is perhaps the biggest selling point of The Hellblade Saga, both  games delve deep into Senua's psyche, portraying her battle with psychosis through a blend of narrative and gameplay. The story is both harrowing and compelling, making players feel a deep connection to Senua's journey. The first game is more scary and disturbing, while the second one is more action packed and cinematic.\r\nThe atmospheric sound design (including the disturbing voices that whisper in the character’s head) and haunting visuals enhance the narrative and takes it to the next level, never before experienced in a video game, at least for me.\r\nAs the game recommends, I would also recommend playing this with headphones on instead of speakers. However, at this point, these games are practically interactive movies, and while awesome ones at that, it might not resonate well with players who are looking for more control and more gameplay in their games.\r\nAs far as the praises go, I still find The Hellblade Saga a bit overrated for what it offers to the average gamer. Sure, the storytelling is top-notch, but everything else feels basic. Gameplay wise, the only reason it doesn’t feel repetitive or boring is because it’s a tight, short-lived experience. Considering it is available for almost-free of charge via Microsoft's gamepass subscription, It's still worth trying out, especially since it will only take a short amount of your time.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7894411) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "body": "For the past few months, there is only one game that has mostly kept me busy playing throughout sleepness nights and weekends, and you're probably tired of hearing about it. Helldivers 2. A coop shooter with hardcore elements and action-packed cinematic gameplay.\r\nWhat is Helldivers 2? How is the Gameplay?\r\nFrom the onset, it looks like a typical coop shooter like Left 4 Dead 2, GTFO, Deep Rock Galactic, World War Z, which are all stellar games by the way, so you might think this game has nothing special to it. Hell, even Helldivers 1 is very very similar except top down.\r\nHowever, Helldivers 2 has hit the jackpot on several fronts. It has funny / epic themes, intense cinematic action, addicting progression and mechanics, and fun gameplay overall. There is no better feeling than dropping down with your friends, completing a very hard mission, getting overwhelmed by a mix of either bugs or robots, and making it to the extraction point by the skin of your teeth.\r\nHigh Replayability\r\nI am already roughly 200hrs+ in and I am mostly maxed out in upgrades and resources, but I still enjoy playing it. Compare that to many games, like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, where a bunch of hours in and it just feels like a chore to play and beat.\r\nThe game is highly replayable since the roster of planets to play on rotates every few days or so, thanks to the game’s highly live-service-like elements. It introduces a “Galactic War” that all players will participate in to liberate/defend planets. Not enough players completing missions on a planet will result in the planet being lost. The territories change on a day-to-day basis, so there are new planets and maps to conquer every few days. Additionally, the maps are procedurally generated, so you’ll never see the exact same map.\r\nAddicting Progression and Content\r\nIn terms of progression, Helldivers 2 sets a new standard — people usually hate live service games for good reason, but this is live service done right! Completing missions rewards you with XP and currency, which can be used to unlock additional stratagems, mission upgrades, and armor/weapons. It gets you excited to play more to unlock more. What’s better is that no unlock is locked behind paywalls, and all items in the game are reasonably grindable, and the grind is fun in itself that you don’t even notice.\r\nThe developers are also very active in delivering more content to the game, in tandem with the live service Galactic War and its developing story on a day-to-day basis. New content is delivered every few weeks, such as new weapons, stratagems, and more, providing even players who have seen everything with an incentive to come back to the game. It’s just a game that keeps on giving. The game is set to release its biggest update yet coming August 6, 2024. Including a new higher difficulty setting, new types of enemies, missions, and more unannounced stuff are teased.\r\nSony PSN Issue\r\nAnother thing, the game got a lot of external flak a few months ago —and still up to now, due to Sony’s PSN account requirements, which led to the game being delisted in over 100 countries (countries where the game was initially listed in, with people already buying it from these countries).\r\nIt hasn’t been relisted since then, so people from these countries cannot purchase the game anymore. While those who already did before can still play, they aren't able to invite new friends anymore — unless you jump through a bunch of hoops and purchase third party keys online, a risky move.\r\nPower of a Destroyer in the palm of your hands\r\nPerhaps my favorite aspect is the hardcore nature of the game and the action-packed gameplay, which is highly characterized by its Stratagem feature. It allows players to call in various types of support, equipment, and weaponry during missions by inputting a series of button commands, similar to entering a cheat code.\r\nIt’s a simple mechanic, but ultra effective at giving players a sense of control over a huge arsenal of firepower. Every helldiver is basically a man equipped with a power of a Destroyer in orbit. Rain down artillery, call down airstrikes, or summon Titan-killing weapons. Of course, killing friendlies is as easy as killing enemies, and the game is very unforgiving when it comes to friendly fire. So you have to manage your firepower and coordinate.\r\nMy only gripes is that the game crashes from time to time, and some game breaking (software) bugs that will sporadically appear, causing you to lose a bit of progress because a mission wouldn’t complete. Still, the game’s intense fun and replayability more than makes up for it.\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io/post/7894049) Originally posted on TapTap.",

    "description": "Metaphor: ReFantazio is an RPG that practically bursts with style and confidence. It takes the familiar tropes of high fantasy—kings, curses, and a sprawling magical world—and infuses them with Persona energy.",

    "category": "review",
    "body": "**Metaphor: ReFantazio** is a compelling turn-based RPG that combines classic turn-based combat with fresh mechanics and a captivating story.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🎭 Dynamic combat system allowing on-the-fly class changes - 📖 Rich, intriguing narrative with immersive cutscenes - 🎨 Vibrant and detailed visuals with expressive character animations - 🎵 Atmospheric soundtrack enhancing the mood - ⚔️ Combat is addictive without feeling repetitive ## Cons\r\n- 🖱️ Overly sensitive camera and control settings that can frustrate players - 🐢 Some pacing issues, especially during story-heavy segments - 🚪 Limited slice-of-life moments reduce world immersion </div> The Persona footprint is immediately visible everywhere you look. From the slick, high-energy UI and calendar-based progression to the distinct camera angles and movement, fans of the series will feel right at home (I even had to lower the camera sensitivity, just like in Persona!). The presentation is gorgeous, with cutscenes that feel like you're watching a high-budget anime.\r\nHowever, where Metaphor carves its own path is in its focus. The deep \"slice-of-life\" simulation of the Persona games is largely absent here. Instead of balancing school life with dungeon crawling, this experience is laser-focused on the grand journey and the mission at hand. There are still light social elements, like bonding with your companions by eating at an inn at the end of the day, but the game is fundamentally about the quest, not the daily life between quests. The game's social elements come into play with the follower system, by strengthening your bonds with your Followers, you unlock new abilities and powerful new Archetypes (which are basically the classes in this game), making social progression feel integral to the journey itself, rather than a separate daily activity.\r\nThe combat system, while it follows a typical Persona or Shin Megami Tensei formula is the game's crowning achievement. At first, it appears to be real-time, but it’s a clever hybrid system. In the overworld, you can dash and attack enemies directly, but once you interact with enemies, you can enter a turn-based combat which is where most of the gameplay is focused on. One good thing that I love is, If you're powerful enough, you can defeat weaker mobs right then and there, completely bypassing the turn-based battle instance. This single feature is a brilliant innovation that dramatically reduces the repetitive \"rinse and repeat\" grind common in many turn-based JRPGs.\r\nThe presentation is gorgeous, with cutscenes that feel like you're watching an anime, wait, it IS an anime, at some parts. The story, while perhaps a bit uninteresting at the very start, builds momentum beautifully, becoming incredibly compelling by its midway point. The world-building is particularly thought-provoking. The protagonist reads an illustrated storybook that seems to be about our modern world, and even more curiously, the monsters roaming the land are referred to as \"Humans.\" It sparks fascinating theories: what if this is a glimpse into our own world's distant future, and that book is not a fantasy, but a history text? It's these intriguing details that make the world so captivating and the story so unique in my perspective.\r\nThe narrative unfolds as a political journey across the kingdom. Traveling in your mobile base, you must visit different regions, solve their unique problems, and win the trust and belief of their people to build your support. You'll interact with a rich cast of characters, from the allies who become your loyal Followers to the other charismatic rivals competing for the throne, all while uncovering the deeper mysteries of the world, such as the nature of the monstrous creatures known as \"Humans.\r\n</div>",

    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "I was a huge fan of the first game, *Shadow of Mordor*. So when *Shadow of War* was announced, promising a bigger scale of the same formula - a third-person action-adventure RPG that felt like a hybrid of the **Batman Arkham** and **Assassin's Creed** series - I was immediately excited. What could possibly go wrong?\r\n## Pros\r\n* ⚔️ The Nemesis, Follower, and Fortress systems all deliver a highly addictive, dynamic cycle of personalized conquest and betrayal. A much expanded system from the first game.\r\n* 📜 The story takes a bold, compelling \"What If\" approach to *Lord of the Rings* lore, which ultimately works brilliantly as a fresh take.\r\n* 💥 The combat system remains a satisfying free-flow experience, allowing you to fluidly chain attacks, counters, and diverse abilities.\r\n* 💍 The addictive gear system constantly rewards you for completing specific challenges to unlock each item's legendary power.\r\n* 🗺️ Side quests are so well-designed and integrated that their storytelling matches the quality of the main campaign.\r\n* 📱 The graphics still hold up exceptionally well, and the game is a fantastic fit for the Steam Deck, running great on the go.\r\n## Cons\r\n* 🐌 The first few hours can be slow, and could act as a significant barrier, as the game takes too long to ramp up and hook the player.\r\n* 🔗 The larger scale and multiple maps results in a less tight experience where the different regions can feel disjointed and not connected to each other especially with regards to the Nemesis system.\r\nWell, as it turned out, the launch was botched by the inclusion of a pay-to-win system and excessive, grindy elements. I was so put off that I totally lost all the hype and ignore the game on release. Being the patient gamer that I am, I was able to finally try the game in 2021, the microtransactions were gone, but something about the early hours still didn't click for me. i didnt get hooked in enough to play past the the first area. Maybe it was because the cool abilities from the end of the first game were gone because the main character got nerfed in the story (understandably), or maybe the massive scale felt overwhelming. Whatever the reason, the game just didn't hook me. I dropped it, refunded it, and for years, I was content to believe I'd never play it again.\r\nThat all changed this year when I got a free key of the game thanks to a friends Humble Monthly sub. I activated the game and decided to relegate the game as a Steam Deck “exclusive” to play on the go. And wow, it's absolutely perfect for the handheld. The performance is fantastic, especially with lossless scaling, and playing it on the OLED screen is a phenomenal experience. I had to power through the same initial two-to-three-hour slog that killed my first attempt, but once I did, everything finally clicked. What started as just supposed to be occasional game I'd play on breaks quickly became a staple, and I ended up beating it in just a few days.\r\nThat slow start is, without a doubt, the worst part of the game. However, once you push through it, the rest of the experience is incredibly rewarding. The game's narrative finds its footing, the **RPG progression** becomes compelling, and the famously patented **Nemesis and Follower systems** become incredibly addictive. The combat remains the same satisfying free-flow style of its predecessor, allowing you to fluidly take on multiple enemies at once with a satisfying mix of attacks, counters, and a plethora of moves without missing the beat. You can chain together **executions** to instantly kill enemies, perform **ground finishers** on downed foes, or unleash a powerful **Elven Light** blast to stun and blind entire groups. Not to mention the ranged combat moves you can perform and how you can mount beasts like Caragors.\r\nThe story of *Shadow of War* acts as a compelling \"What If\" scenario, feeling more like a high-quality fan fiction than a canonical part of Tolkien's world. It's a plausible tale that explores an alternative path for Middle-earth's heroes, particularly with its focus on Celebrimbor and a new Ring of Power. However, it's so well-integrated with the lore, especially the cinematic versions, that you can almost pretend it's a hidden chapter that inserts itself nicely within, at least the lore of the movies. The events can fit neatly between *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, offering a fresh perspective on the war against Sauron without directly contradicting the films' narrative. It expands on familiar themes and settings, making it feel both fresh and comfortably familiar to fans of the movies. Purist might hate how the game “breaks” the lore and the canon, but personally, I love their take on it. Dare I say, I wish more video game adaptations were this bold and liberated; it’s a creative risk that pays off nicely.\r\nThe literal patented “Nemesis” system, which is truly the heart of the experience, is what makes the game shine. It procedurally generates a unique army of named Orc captains, each with their own distinct strengths, weaknesses, personalities, and relationships. These captains will remember your previous encounters. If one kills you, he'll level up, grow more powerful, and might even get a new title to commemorate his victory. This creates a genuine sense of rivalry. As you progress, you can dominate these captains and turn them into your own loyal followers. You'll command them to betray their former allies, assassinate rival warlords, or act as your personal bodyguards. You'll also use this system to lay siege to massive fortresses, commanding your orc army to assault the gates and eventually topple the fortress’s overlord.\r\nThe Nemesis System's addictive nature lies in how it turns every encounter into a strategic puzzle and a personal narrative. It gives you a choice: you can **methodically dismantle the enemy's hierarchy**, systematically targeting captains, dominating them to turn them to your side, or killing them to weaken the fortress's defenses from the ground up. By taking out key captains and their bodyguards, you can reduce the number of enemies you'll face inside and even turn the Warchiefs against their Overlord, making the final assault a breeze. Or, if you're feeling confident, you can **rise to the challenge** and bypass the whole process, taking on the fortress and its Overlord head-on from the very start. Either way, the system creates an endless cycle of betrayal, revenge, and conquest that makes every victory feel uniquely earned. Even the quest system is a huge win for the game. The side quests are so well-formatted and thoughtfully designed that their storytelling is on par with the main campaign. They don’t feel like an afterthought; in fact, without the proper icons, you’d have a hard time telling which are part of the main story and which are not. Many are also directly integrated into the progression and item systems, giving you excellent incentives to complete them.\r\nThis leads to the surprisingly compelling item system. It's so much more than just finding better loot. Every piece of gear you pick up, your sword, dagger, armor, and even your ring, has its own set of stats and unique perks. What makes it so addictive is that you can \"awaken\" each item's true power by completing a specific challenge, like killing a certain type of orc or performing a specific combat move, you can unlock a new perk and upgrade the item to legendary status. This creates a constant loop of discovery and personal challenge, where you're always excited to find new gear and put in the work to make it truly yours. It's a system that consistently rewards your investment and makes you feel powerful.\r\nMy only minor gripes are the frequent repetition of Orc names and that the Orcs (and your nemesis/followers) can’t really transfer seamlessly between areas/fortresses without jumping  bunch of hoops, the different areas feel disjointed as a result. And it isn’t as tight of an experience as the first game because of the bigger scale. Lastly, while the parkour system is generally smooth, it occasionally has a mind of its own, snapping to ledges or jumping to walls you didn’t intend to, in a way that feels similar to the *Assassin's Creed* titles.\r\nAside from these gripes, the game is a triumph. While I played most of the campaign on my Steam Deck, I switched to my desktop PC for the final few hours to crank up the visuals and experience it at its full glory. And to my surprise, the graphics hold up exceptionally well. *Shadow of War* looks every bit as good as a modern AAA title and could easily pass as one if it were released today.\r\nDespite its rocky launch and a frustrating first attempt, *Middle-earth: Shadow of War* ultimately redeemed itself completely for me. A chance encounter was all it took for me to realize that its incredible core gameplay, fueled by the highly addictive **Nemesis, Follower, and Fortress systems**, creates a fantastic experience. Its emergent storytelling, set against the backdrop of the masterpiece that is the *Lord of the Rings* universe, truly makes it a worthy and triumphant sequel to the first one.",

    "description": "Split Fiction is an exclusively two-player experience defined by",
    "tags": "",
    "author": "lyndonguitar",
    "category": "review",
    "body": "When Hazelight, the studio behind co-op classics like *A Way Out* and *It Takes Two (a GOTY winner, by the way)*, releases a new game, people pay attention. Their latest title, *Split Fiction*, had a lot to live up to when it was revealed at last year’s The Game Awards. Fortunately, the game absolutely delivers: it's an incredible achievement in game design and sets a new bar for couch co-op. However, while the gameplay is brilliant and constantly surprising, the story holding it all together is disappointingly simple.\r\n**Pros**\r\n* 🧠 One of the most original and inventive level designs and game mechanics ever conceived.\r\n* ❤️ The absolute gold standard for couple's or split-screen gaming experiences.\r\n* 🎢 Constantly jumps between themes, levels, and mechanics, keeping the experience fresh.\r\n* 🤣 Full of fun, comedy, and engaging banter between the two leads.\r\n* 🕹️ Extremely user-friendly controls cater perfectly to casual or new players.\r\n* 🎨 A visually vibrant, coherent world where fantasy and sci-fi mesh beautifully.\r\n**Cons**\r\n* 📖 The overarching story is basic, forgettable, and lacks the emotional depth of previous titles.\r\n* ⚠️ The high level of accessibility leaves seasoned gamers wanting a difficulty toggle or challenge options.\r\n*Split Fiction* is an exclusively two-player experience defined by its literal split screen. You cannot play this game in single player mode or with just one screen. It s always split-screen coop for the entirety of the experience. The brilliance lies in how the game seamlessly weaves together contrasting worlds of sci-fi and fantasy, switching between Mio's cyberpunk sci-fi worlds and Zoe's magical fantasy realms as the story progresses. This dynamic split-screen design introduces dozens of unique gameplay mechanics every level, constantly reinventing itself with new abilities, powers, and challenges that require precise communication and coordination between both players. It has arguably **one of the most creative level and game mechanic designs for a co-op game, or any video game, ever.**\r\n## **Constant Gameplay Innovation From Start To Finish**\r\nThe sheer flow of original ideas in *Split Fiction* is why this game is so essential. It forces you and your partner to constantly invent new ways to interact across the dimensional divide. You’ll be convinced that this is it, this is the peak of the game, the devs must have probably ran out of the ideas, only for **them to go and impress you again on the very next level.** This relentless creativity continues right up to the credits; the game **never runs out of fresh concepts.**\r\nThe mechanical puzzles are stunningly diverse. In one section, Zoe transforms into a Groot-like being to manipulate deadly flowers and force them to recede, while Mio shapeshifts into an amphibian creature to drag them both across piranha-infested waters. Later, Mio and Zoe find themselves on opposite sides of a room blocked by color-coded force fields, requiring them to shoot grenades at boxes on a conveyor belt and time their blasts perfectly to break through barriers. In another puzzle, Mio uses her ape transformation to push an ice cube while Zoe lifts tiles on the grid in her tree form, creating barriers that guide the cube to its destination.\r\nThe imaginative scale of these interactions is breathtaking and never runs out until the game ends. Importantly, the game maintains **outstanding pacing that keeps you jumping from multiple different levels, themes, and game mechanics every once in a while.** No puzzle drags on too long, and no single combat style becomes repetitive. You might however, love certain sections so much that you’d want to replay these again in the future, and that’s certainly possible since you can revisit the different levels in the game if you wanted to.\r\n## **The Ultimate Date Night Game**\r\nThis exceptional cooperative focus solidifies *Split Fiction*'s reputation as **the best co-op, split-screen, or couple’s game available, probably on par and even surpassing Hazelight’s own *It Takes Two* in some aspects**. It is impossible to succeed without genuine communication and trust, making it a perfect choice for couples or friends who want a deeply shared, problem-solving experience.\r\nThe tone is another major asset. The experience is **full of fun and comedy, lighthearted but with a touch of seriousness** that grounds the plot when it needs to. The banter between the protagonists – one reserved and pragmatic, and one cheerful and optimistic – is genuinely funny and a good dynamic. The world is a joy to inhabit, and the design frequently encourages players to spend a moment messing around before tackling the next big objective.\r\n## **A Very Accessible Game**\r\nConsidering the main selling point is coop, and that coop play is probably with someone who’s not a gamer, the entire game is **very accessible to casual players.** Platforming segments are forgiving, and even the aiming mechanics are simplified with slight assists and magnetized jump ledges. This ensures that players of all skill levels can remain engaged and, crucially, that neither partner feels like they are the anchor slowing the team down.\r\nHowever, this ease of use is a double-edged sword for the seasoned gamer. The game might come across as a little too easy for veteran players, and there is currently no way to up the challenge, at least for a specific player. There should be \"reverse accessibility\" settings for veterans, allowing them to turn off magnetism, aim assist, platforming assists, and other helpful features for them only. Hazelight has perfected the ability to make players feel clever, but they have yet to master the art of making veterans feel truly tested.\r\n## **A Beautiful Traditional Game**\r\nBeyond the mechanics, *Split Fiction* delivers a gorgeous audiovisual experience. The game **runs great and looks great.** It doesn't rely on cutting-edge graphical tricks like ray tracing or frame generation; instead, it uses a **pure, traditional style of graphics.** The vibrant color palette and smooth, highly detailed character models give the impression that you are inside a **highly interactive, top-tier 3D animated movie.**\r\nThe art direction is magnificent. Despite constantly shifting between fantasy and sci-fi aesthetics, the game **loses no sense of identity.** Everything meshes seamlessly together, from the colors and the environments to the characters themselves, creating one coherent, imaginative world. The atmosphere is further bolstered by a fantastic soundtrack that shifts effortlessly between sweeping orchestral scores for the fantasy side and pulsing synth-wave beats for the futuristic settings.\r\n## **The Simplistic Narrative**\r\nThe story, while functional, is easily the game's weakest element. The setup – two writers trapped in a simulation by Rader Publishing's CEO, who plans to harvest their creative ideas—is simple and often predictable. It Takes Two elevated its premise with the emotional complexity of a crumbling marriage, delivering Pixar-caliber storytelling that gave weight to every mechanic. Split Fiction opts for a more straightforward \"tech villain\" narrative that, while serviceable, rarely reaches beyond familiar beats. The corporate antagonist feels more buffoonish than menacing, and the overarching plot lacks the thematic depth that made the previous game's relationship drama so compelling.\r\nTo its credit, the developers manage to save face with strong character writing. They do a solid job developing the relationship between the two protagonists, making their individual journeys and back-and-forth dialogue interesting enough to sustain the adventure. But the core narrative lacks the emotional weight and thematic complexity that made the studio’s previous work so memorable.\r\n## **Conclusion**\r\n*Split Fiction* is an absolutely mandatory purchase for anyone seeking a truly collaborative and awesomely cool gaming experience. It is a masterpiece of game mechanics and level design, constantly surprising, entertaining, and visually stunning. It provides dozens of hours of pure co-op fun. (We clocked in at 20+ hrs beating it). While the overarching story is weak and experienced players will long for a difficulty toggle, these minor flaws are easily forgiven when faced with the overwhelming amount of creativity poured into every scene. Grab a friend and experience some of the most innovative design in modern gaming; you won’t regret it.",

    "body": "**Star Wars Outlaws** offers a decent shooter experience within a richly realized Star Wars universe. While its gunplay and environments shine, the story, gameplay elements, and depth hold it back from greatness.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🔫 Tight, satisfying gunplay mechanics - 🌌 Stunning and authentic Star Wars environments - 🎨 Impressive lighting and visual effects - 🎯 Good pacing in combat sequences - 🎮 Decent stealth mechanics when working properly ## Cons\r\n- 📖 Story is uninspired with unlikable main characters - 🤨 Suspension of disbelief broken by some stealth inconsistencies (e.g., punching armored stormtroopers) - ⚠️ Occasional bugs and AI quirks detract from immersion </div>\r\nThe game's strongest asset is its incredible presentation. The graphics are amazing, especially when you're taking in the world itself. The lighting, the environmental detail, and the sweeping landscapes all pay perfect respect to what Star Wars looks and feels like. From the dusty, sun-beaten streets of a desert moon to the neon glow of criminal dens, the atmosphere is simply fantastic. However, this visual excellence is most apparent when you’re not looking at the human character models, which unfortunately don't quite reach the same level of quality as the stunning worlds they inhabit.\r\nThe gameplay loop is built around living the life of an up-and-coming outlaw. The questing sends you across the galaxy on various scoundrel-themed missions—from high-stakes heists and smuggling runs to tracking down valuable bounties. As with the aforementioned reputation system, completing a job for the Pyke Syndicate might earn you their favor and unlock exclusive gear, but it could simultaneously sour your relationship with their rivals on that specific planet. This system adds a welcome layer of choice to your journey through the underworld, making you think carefully about your allegiances.\r\nYou're also never truly alone, thanks to your loyal companion, Nix. This small, clever creature is a key gameplay tool, capable of distracting enemies, fetching weapons, retrieving distant objects, and activating switches, adding a unique and helpful dynamic to both stealth and combat. And most of all, he's cute.\r\nThis is compounded by gameplay choices that can shatter the suspension of disbelief. The stealth system, while functional, has moments that are hard to ignore, most notably the ability to knock out a fully armored stormtrooper—complete with a helmet—with a single punch from your bare hands. It's moments like these that pull you out of an otherwise immersive world.",

    "body": "**The Alters** surprised me as one of the most compelling strategy/survival games this year. At first glance, it reminded me of Fallout Shelter or XCOM, but it quickly reveals deeper, thought-provoking themes wrapped inside an addictive base-building experience.\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🏗️ Deep, rewarding base-building mechanics with plenty of player freedom - 🧠 Social survival elements and existential storylines that add depth - 🎨 Unique art style with strong atmospheric world-building - ⚙️ Engaging resource management that keeps gameplay fresh - 💡 Exploration of cloning and alternate realities provides a rich narrative backdrop ## Cons\r\n- 🖥️ Performance issues on PC, with some stuttering even on high-end rigs - 🔍 Visual polish uneven, with some UE5 jankiness present - 📉 Blurry visuals on console despite smooth frame rates This is a game that wraps an addictive strategic loop inside a deep, thought-provoking narrative about existence itself, creating one of the most compelling and surprising experiences of the year.\r\nAt its core, The Alters features a deep and rewarding base-building loop that will hook anyone with a strategic mind. You are Jan Dolski, a simple worker stranded on a hostile alien planet, and your only hope for survival is a massive, mobile wheel base that you must constantly expand and maintain. The gameplay is an intricate dance of resource management; you'll send Alters out on expeditions, refine materials, manage power consumption, and carefully plan the layout of your base.\r\nThere's a tangible satisfaction, similar to games like Factorio or Satisfactory, that comes from creating a perfectly efficient, self-sustaining system that is safe from radiation, has decent food for everyone, plenty of extra supplies, and has enough power to move the base around. Something in your brain just clicks, compelling you to play for hours more just to optimize one more production line or research one more upgrade.\r\nThis addictive gameplay is in service of a narrative that is shockingly deep and can pull its own weight, and I would say, the story is so compelling and thought-provoking that it doesn't just pull its own weight, it probably carries the gameplay altogether. This is a signature of 11 bit studios, the same minds behind Frostpunk, and their talent for incorporating heavy themes into gameplay is on full display. The story tackles fascinating topics I had never considered before, all centered around cloning, alternate realities, and existential crises.\r\nVisually, the game has a distinct and powerful art style that creates a compelling, lonely atmosphere against the alien landscape. However, the polish is uneven, and you can clearly see some \"UE5 jank\" in places. My experience with performance was also a mixed bag. On a high-end PC (RTX 5080 and Ryzen 7 5700X3D), the game was unfortunately quite stuttery, with inconsistent framerates that broke the immersion. In contrast, the Xbox Series X version, despite having noticeably blurrier visuals, delivered silky-smooth performance. </div>",

    "body": "**Chained Echoes** is an indie game that will give you a sense of familiarity if you have a broad knowledge on various JRPG franchises, notable references include Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, to name a few. Some cut scenes are familiar to the player because of its references to older games, and it is known to break the fourth wall, especially when it comes to character banter.\r\nThe game allows you to allocate skills and stats to your liking - and can be restrictive during the early game because of the pacing of the story, however, it will be trivial once you are familiar with the Overdrive mechanic. It is a complement to the turn-based feature that tries to maintain your skill types by not just spamming the same skill all over and the game itself did a great job on handling this.\r\nThe story emphasizes the motivations of the characters, where you actually get to know the characters behind the scenes. On the other hand, the character banters are the best moments to break the ice when there are certain scenes that are serious.\r\nThe reward board can feel like a chore if you are planning to maximize the game has to offer. Getting the rest of the classes and its related items can be locked through reward boards - which requires you to do certain gimmicks like killing a certain enemy using only the protagonist.\r\nThe music is a reminiscent of the old school JRPGs, and they were able to keep the music as relaxing as possible, while maintaining the theme of the game. I would say that the cut scenes really match with the music - especially during the heartbreaking scenes. Overall, I would still recommend this game for a timeless classic, as someone who loves JRPG, **Chained Echoes** is a must try for people who loves turn based games!",

    "body": "This was the first HD-2D game Square Enix developed along with Acquire. This is a good spiritual successor of Bravely Default but this game can be a huge time sink due to eight characters having different stories. Characters you have recruited during the course of your playthrough will scale accordingly depending on the number of travelers you have recruited after. You start the game by picking the character of your choosing which is a nice touch and a huge upgrade to the JRPG class system based on your class preference. What I liked about the game itself is that it allows you to have interactions with NPCs that allows you to purchase items that are normally missing through the shops and armorer, inquire to gain valuable information and to be more receptive with certain actions in the field, challenge to a battle to gain item drops that are not normally present through other means of acquiring and guide the NPC which allows the said NPC to be summoned during battles.\r\nThis game has a lot of flexibility in terms of exploring the world since you can go to different regions to your heart's content. You can choose to continue the next chapter of the character's tale or choose to explore the rest of the world. Everything else is up to you.\r\nSoundtrack is great and there is so much to love for the background music.\r\nFor completionists, you will need to play the game at a slower pace that requires you to analyse non-one time encounters enemies without missing its entries. Once you recruited travelers, the danger level will increase. Good thing that one-time encounters such as bosses for each chapter are not required. It may be possible to miss enemies and not exploit its weaknesses if you are playing blindly.\r\nThe difficulty curve of this game makes the game feel like a drag if you are still not familiar with the abilities of the classes of your travelers which can make the battle not just lengthier, but the lack of familiarity of the travelers' ability itself can punish you at times at a later chapter. Utilising support skills can change the tide of the battle as well as purchasing Job Points to learn new abilities for the travelers to use for its related subclass. Not to mention, punishing drop rates just to get certain items can make the game feel like a gacha game. Getting more experience points just to align with the danger level on later chapters can also make your playthrough a bit longer if you're not really focusing on maintaining traveler levels.\r\nUltimately, Octopath Traveler is a beautiful game that totally nails the old-school JRPG vibe. It doesn't hold your hand, and it can be a serious time sink, but if you're willing to put in the effort to learn its deep systems, the payoff is a seriously rewarding and nostalgic adventure. It’s a game that asks for a lot of your time, but it definitely gives you a rich experience in return.",
