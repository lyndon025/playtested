    "body": "**Assassin’s Creed Shadows** is an impressive entry in the Assassin’s Creed series that strips back the heavier RPG elements introduced in recent titles. Instead, it delivers a focused stealth and combat experience wrapped in some of the most breathtaking environments and immersive weather effects I’ve seen in the franchise.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🗡️ Toned-down RPG mechanics making gameplay more straightforward  \r\n- 🌄 Stunning and detailed environments with dynamic weather that take your breath away  \r\n- 🕵️ Strong stealth mechanics with a wide variety of tools and approaches  \r\n- 🛠️ Quality-of-life features that enhance accessibility and player freedom  \r\n- 🎭 Engaging story with well-crafted villains and believable motivations  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🔄 Some fans may miss the depth and complexity of the RPG-heavy Assassin’s Creed entries  \r\n- 🕹️ Combat can occasionally feel simplified and repetitive  \r\n- ⚙️ Minor AI quirks and technical hiccups occasionally disrupt immersion  \r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-03-30-ac-shadows-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Assassin’s Creed Shadows\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n**Assassin’s Creed Shadows** is a beautiful game. Already from the get go, I was blown away by the graphics and the environments. The developers clearly poured immense care into crafting expansive, richly detailed locales that are not just visually stunning but feel alive. Whether it’s wandering through dense forests shrouded in morning winter mist, exploring rain-soaked cobblestone streets, or scaling sunlit towers against sprawling vistas, the game delivers a vivid sense of place and it clearly showcases the seasonal beauty of Feudal Japan like no other.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite features is the dynamic weather system. Shifting fog, pouring rain, thick snow, and golden sunsets all dynamically impact the atmosphere, dramatically enhancing immersion. During one play session, a sudden storm rolled in while I was navigating through a remote village, the sound of rain pattering on rooftops and thunder rumbling in the distance truly pulled me deeper into the experience and took my breath away. It’s these moments where the game transcends typical open-world visuals and becomes an amazing experience.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-03-30-ac-shadows-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Assassin’s Creed Shadows\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n<div>\r\nThe streamlined RPG mechanics make it much easier to jump in and enjoy the core gameplay without getting bogged down by complicated menus or inventory management. Not to mention they actually added controller navigation instead of that god awful mouse-like cursor-based navigation in the last few games. \r\n\r\nAs for the equipment, the game has all the tools you will need. Various weapons are available for both Naoe and Yasuke, and they are all compelling to play with. The ability to upgrade all weapons and tailor your playstyle without constant gear switching is neat. You won't be forced to switch to a new ugly weapon with bad effects just because it is newer and has a higher level, because you can upgrade any weapons to keep up its level. There is no worry of looting a cool weapon too early rendering it unusuable in late game, unlike in other games.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nStealth is a joy here — the AI responds believably (especially if you up the difficulty), and the variety of gadgets and tactics available means no two approaches have to feel the same. Whether creeping through shadows or launching surprise attacks from rooftops, the game empowers you with multiple ways to solve challenges. This allows for a more fluid stealth experience, where you can silently dispatch guards, distract enemies, and use environmental kills in creative ways. It's not just stealth that is done well here, but the traditional combat as well. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-03-30-ac-shadows-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Assassin’s Creed Shadows\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n  <div>\r\nWhile Naoe is more of the traditional ninja or shinobe style, Yasuke is the unstoppable brute force of the game. His playstyle is the total opposite, there is significantly less emphasis on stealth and climbing, and more emphasis on breaking down stuff, engaging multiple opponents outloud, and throwing them around the place. Both characters have their own contrasts playstyles and you can switch between the two for the majority of the missions.\r\n\r\nThe story is solid and engaging, presenting well-developed antagonists with motivations that feel grounded and believable. The intro of the mysterious villains in particular was a very powerful scene that kept me hook and gave me a motivation to play from the start. It gave this western film vibes and is probably the best villain group introduction out of all the AC games so far. This narrative depth gives weight to your missions and makes your progression through the world feel meaningful.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\nDespite these strengths, the combat sometimes suffers from a lack of variety, feeling a bit repetitive over time, especially with the combat animations. Some encounters don’t demand much tactical thinking, which may disappoint players looking for more challenge. AI behaviors can occasionally feel inconsistent, with enemies missing obvious cues or acting unpredictably.\r\n\r\nMinor technical issues like frame drops or clipping glitches don’t significantly mar the experience but are noticeable in a game otherwise so polished. Overall, the game is well optimized on both PC and consoles as I played on both PC and Xbox Series X via my Ubi+ subscription.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-03-30-ac-shadows-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Assassin’s Creed Shadows\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n**Assassin’s Creed Shadows** is a strong, focused entry that balances streamlined gameplay with some of the most gorgeous and immersive worlds in the series. Its breathtaking environments,  dynamic weather effects alone, and impressive, optimized graphics make it worth playing, while the refined stealth, brutal combat, and accessible mechanics make it enjoyable for both newcomers and veterans. Despite some combat repetition and minor technical hiccups, it’s a satisfying return to form for the franchise.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "title": "Remedy's best offering since Max Payne 1 and 2 | Alan Wake 2 Review",
    "description": "Alan Wake II is a survival horror game focused on storytelling, psychological horror, and survival. It features two playable stories with stunning graphics and a star-studded cast.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "✨Overview  \r\nAlan Wake II is a survival horror game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Epic Games. The game is designed as a single-player experience, focusing on storytelling, psychological horror, and survival elements. It features a unique format, divided into two separate single-player stories, each playable in any order the player chooses.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of Remedy's single-player experiences, from the good old days of Max Payne 1 and 2 to following the long winded development of Alan Wake with its eventual release on the Xbox 360. More recently, the highly praised Control. Every game has been great so far. Alan Wake 2 aims to continue that tradition while also pushing the boundaries of graphics fidelity and storytelling in a singleplayer experience. Well, is it successful?\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- Gripping and masterful storytelling  \r\n- Next-gen level of visuals  \r\n- Amazing sound design  \r\n- Stellar cast of new and familiar faces  \r\n- Non-linear style of chapters  \r\n- A terrifying psychological survival horror experience  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- Mind Place feels too cumbersome at times as both a gameplay element and a menu system  \r\n- Cheap use of jumpscares, it doesn’t really need them  \r\n- Pacing can be quite slow, especially if you’re used to Quantum Break and Control  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📖Story and Premise  \r\nSet 13 years after the events of the first game, the story once again revolves around the protagonist, best-selling horror novelist Alan Wake, and an FBI agent named Saga Anderson. Alan Wake, the central character, is trapped in a nightmarish realm known as the Dark Place, while Saga Anderson and his partner, Alex Casey, investigate mysterious murder cases in Bright Falls. The game weaves a complex narrative that combines elements of horror, psychological thriller, and supernatural mystery. Further in the game’s narrative, players can take on the role of either Alan Wake or Saga Anderson, and their stories are interconnected, providing different perspectives on the unfolding mystery.\r\n\r\n## 🎨Graphics and Art Style  \r\nGraphics-wise, this is perhaps one of the most technically impressive and good-looking games that were released this year. The game features highly realistic character models, dynamic lighting, and shadow effects that enhance the sense of unease and tension, which are core elements of the gameplay. The contrast between light and shadow is used to create terrifying and visually striking scenes. The game incorporates surreal audiovisual and supernatural elements into its visuals, as well as the use of live-action elements in tandem with its game engine. The game's graphics seamlessly blend these elements, creating an unsettling and mysterious atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere is also support for ray tracing, path tracing, and frame-gen technologies. Instead of its publisher's own Unreal Engine 5, it uses Remedy’s Northlight engine, which is a rare thing to happen and would only mean that Northlight is THAT good for Epic to approve the non-use of their own Unreal Engine.\r\n\r\n## 📺Presentation  \r\nThe game is told in a TV series-like format, complete with an end-of-chapter song and a quasi-cliffhanger to end them (although nothing is stopping you from continuing the game). I actually love their approach with this one, and these subconsciously served as my personal indicators to take a few minutes' break from playing the game or perhaps an indicator to continue the game at another time. The game is a slow burn; the pacing REALLY is slow. It takes a while to see the first action that you’ll experience in this game, and even then, the action-packed bits are few and far between. There’s lots of walking, investigation, and backtracking, especially with the game’s new “Mind Palace” feature, aptly named “Mind Place”. Which CAN be confusing.\r\n\r\nThe game is brilliantly acted by a star-studded cast, some new and some familiar, returning from both Alan Wake 1 and other Remedy games, such as head writer Sam Lake’s likeness, Max Payne’s voice actor, and even Quantum Break’s main actor is playing a character here. The sound design is equally as brilliant, even the simple swaying of grass or sudden creaking of walls is a terrifying experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, one thing I didn't like about this game is that, even though it doesn’t need it, it still has cheap jump scares and sudden high-pitched audio bits to scare the player. It felt unnecessary and out of place, especially when you are playing as the much more composed Saga.\r\n\r\nAlan Wake II is made so that you can experience the story without playing the first game, but there are some nice callbacks and references, both minor and major, to the first game, as well as Remedy’s other games, especially Control. Frankly, Even I have vague memories of the first game’s narrative, but I do remember the iconic locations and places in it. Because of this, I watched a YouTube recap to refresh my memory of the plot before starting.\r\n\r\n## 🎮Gameplay  \r\nIn terms of gameplay, it is much closer to the original Alan Wake than Remedy’s recent explosive and physics-based destructive games like Quantum Break and Control. It plays like a modern third person survival horror game, such as Resident Evil 2 or 3, but with more psychological thriller vibes that will mess with your head, senses, and terrify you without much physical effort.\r\n\r\nThe game's focus on narrative and atmosphere is evident in the gameplay. Players are frequently tasked with solving environmental puzzles and navigating the map while using their wits and a limited arsenal. The game encourages exploration and rewards players with hidden lore, resources, upgrades, and collectibles. While it might not be as action-packed as some of Remedy's previous titles, it is a conscious decision that aligns with the horror genre.\r\n\r\nOne of the main innovations in Alan Wake II is the introduction of the “Mind Place.” This essentially functions as a 3D menu and is representation of the characters’ minds where players can gather clues and reconstruct the narrative by exploring the minds of key characters. This gameplay element is used for both Alan and Saga and provides an intriguing twist to the gameplay. It not only deepens the psychological horror aspects but also empowers players to actively participate in the storytelling process, which is a unique and engaging feature.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the game allows for free exploration of the town of Bright Falls. Players can investigate locations, and interact with NPCs. This open-ended approach enhances the game's sense of immersion and provides a break from the main storyline. While these activities might not be as compelling as the central narrative, they contribute to the game's world-building and character development.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned Mind Place is a neat, expanded pause feature, but I felt that it was overly expanded and too cumbersome to operate with the current controls it has. Every little thing you find around the world must be organized into the Mind Place a bit too manually, and I found it too troublesome to interact with every now and then to progress the investigation.\r\n\r\n## ⚔️Combat  \r\nCombat in Alan Wake II is an intense and anxiety-inducing experience. The game focuses on a limited supply of resources such as Ammo, Medpacks, and Batteries, so players must think strategically about their approach. There's a deliberate tension in the scarcity of supplies, especially the batteries for your flashlight, which is your primary tool for combating the supernatural forces of darkness.\r\n\r\nThe combat mechanics feel tighter and more responsive compared to the original game. The use of light as a weapon remains a central element of the gameplay. Focusing your flashlight on the shadowy entities weakens them, and players must cleverly manage their flashlight's battery life during encounters. The tension of watching the battery deplete while surrounded by eerie enemies adds layers of fear and excitement to every fight.\r\n\r\n## ⏫Progression  \r\nThe game includes detective elements, with Saga Anderson using Mind Place for investigation to a Players can connect clues on a pinboard, piece together the main mystery, and profile characters to gather clues. Alan Wake’s also has a version of the Mind Place, called “Writer's Room”, which has a different function. Instead of investigation, it allows Alan to affect the reality around him by helping him rearrange and shape his plot while he writes it. The game also features manuscript pages to collect that foreshadow upcoming events or narrate current things as they happen, a returning element from the first game.\r\n\r\nFresh from Spider-Man’s GTA V-like character switching and Lords of the Fallen's dual reality setup, Alan Wake continues the trend by combining both elements into one innovative but familiar feature: Alan Wake 2 features the ability to play chapters in whichever order you want. This feature arrives a bit further into the game at around 5 hours, but it is a core feature of the game from then on. You can switch characters in Alan Wake II at almost any point in any break room you encounter. Saga and Alan both have their own separate chapters, and you’re free to complete them in any order.\r\n\r\n## 📊Technical Performance  \r\nDespite initial concerns about the game’s high system requirements, the game isn’t as bad as the system requirements or the news make it out to be. It still delivers both excellent graphics and performance, on lower than expected hardware. Visually, even just the low and medium preset on PC looks good already, and is already on par with modern-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The game incorporates ray tracing, path tracing, and frame generation technologies, as well as support for FSR and DLSS. My PC ran it surprisingly well, hovering at around 60FPS on my i7-8700k RTX 3080 at 1440p resolution, using a mix of medium and high settings with ray tracing turned off. There is a bit of texture pop-ins especially when switching to Map and the Mind Place, but it isn’t a huge deal breaker for me.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nAlan Wake II is an ambitious game that manages to deliver on its ambitious goals, offering an innovative and terrifying experience executed with confidence and expertise built from years of experience. The sequel retains the essence of the original game while expanding its scope and narrative complexity. Sure, the pacing could be a little bit better, but the game's survival horror elements, combat system, and progression mechanics are well-implemented nonetheless, making it a modern classic in the horror genre. The game introduces intriguing meta-narrative elements, further enhancing its appeal to fans of Remedy's previous works and the Remedy Connected Universe.",

    "title": "This Game Pulls Off Real-Time Tactical Really Well | Aliens: Dark Descent Review",
    "description": "Aliens: Dark Descent offers intense squad-based tactical combat but struggles with frustrating level design, limited formation control, and some immersion-breaking bugs.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "**Aliens: Dark Descent** delivers on intense, squad-based tactical combat in a dark sci-fi setting that fans of the franchise will appreciate. However, its frustrating level design, sometimes buggy pathfinding and immersion-breaking bugs sometimes pull the experience down.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 💥 Intense, tactical squad combat requiring careful planning  \r\n- 👹 Detailed enemy designs, especially aliens and demons, that look great  \r\n- 🌌 Strong sci-fi atmosphere with well-crafted gore and effects  \r\n- 🧠 Challenging gameplay that rewards strategic thinking  \r\n- 🎮 Tactical gameplay blends classic and modern influences effectively  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🗺️ Annoying level design with inconvenient illogical blocked paths and detours  \r\n- 🐛 Occasional immersion-breaking bugs, like units shooting or attacking through walls  \r\n- ⚔️ Damage output and enemy toughness sometimes feel unbalanced  \r\n- 🕹️ Minor UI and control quirks hamper smooth gameplay  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n The gameplay of Aliens Dark Descent is built around commanding a squad of Colonial Marines through claustrophobic, hostile environments where every decision can mean the difference between life and death. The game immediately throws you into claustrophobic, hostile environments where every move matters, which is what Aliens is all about. \r\n\r\n The core gameplay loop revolves around turn-based combat that demands careful planning and strategic use of each squad member’s abilities and equipment like Sentries, Hacking Tools, Medpacks, or Extra Ammunition. Positioning is critical, as Marines have varying weapon ranges, movement capabilities, and special skills. You’ll find yourself constantly weighing the risks of advancing too quickly versus holding back to cover choke points or secure advantageous positions. Go too slow though and the enemy density increases, requiring you to pull back and come back another day. \r\n \r\nGo too slow, however, and the enemy density increases, requiring you to pull back and try again another day. You can retreat from missions at any time and come back later. There's an XCOM-like squad management system where you can research, upgrade, and heal teammates with a day-to-day progression system. Just as with the missions, if you take too many days, the overall density and aggressiveness of the enemies increase. Take even longer, and the campaign might just fail.\r\n Resource management plays a significant role, with limited ammo and medkits forcing players to prioritize targets and conserve supplies. The tension created by scarce resources complements the game’s horror tone, making each firefight feel urgent and dangerous. \r\n\r\nThe level layouts often force you on long detours around broken bridges, locked doors, or barricaded hallways, some of which are very ridiculous because it would just be a minor thing to get past through, which can be predictable but also frustrating when objectives are just within sight. This design choice adds tension but occasionally feels like padding.\r\n\r\nThe enemy designs are excellent, with gruesome alien creatures and fearsome demons that look and feel threatening. The gore effects add to the grim sci-fi atmosphere, immersing you in the horror of the environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, the difficulty balance can feel off. Sometimes, even large squads struggle to quickly dispatch enemies, especially human foes who soak damage, while other times the game feels easier. Certain bugs, such as enemies shooting through walls, break immersion and occasionally cause mission frustration.\r\n\r\nCombat mechanics are a blend of old-school tactical shooters and modern turn-based strategy games. Its like a pausable real-time tactic game and unlike anything I have played before. Each action feels weighty, with careful consideration needed for movement, cover, and attack choice. While the interface and controls are mostly intuitive, occasional quirks in the UI hamper smooth gameplay flow especially if you're using controllers.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had fun with the campaign and it was a nice tense experience all throughout. It satisfied my xeno-purging urges and my need for a tactical satisfaction. I played the game via gamepass but the game regularly goes on sale so definitely a mustplay on a sale if you like the premise of the gameplay.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nAliens: Dark Descent is a solid tactical squad game that captures the dark sci-fi horror of the franchise with intense combat and a gripping atmosphere. Though hampered by level design frustrations and some technical issues, it provides a challenging and rewarding tactical experience for fans willing to overlook its flaws.",

    "title": "The Legendary Combat System | Batman Arkham Asylum Review",
    "description": "Batman Arkham Asylum is the origin of the acclaimed Arkham series. Its tight combat, horror vibe, and claustrophobic levels still deliver a thrilling superhero experience years later.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "**Batman Arkham Asylum** remains a cornerstone of superhero gaming. Released over a decade ago, its blend of stealth, combat, and atmospheric horror still resonates today. Set entirely within the confines of Arkham Asylum, this game is less an open-world adventure and more a tightly woven, claustrophobic detective thriller, while also emphasizing Batman’s early encounters with iconic villains. I beat this game a decade ago but i have recently revisited it so I could continue to the sequels, which I had never played yet.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🦇 Tight, fluid combat mechanics that feel rewarding  \r\n- 🎃 Unique horror atmosphere rarely seen in superhero games  \r\n- 🏢 Compact but detailed level design within Arkham Asylum  \r\n- 🎭 Strong narrative focus on Batman and the Joker without origin retreads  \r\n- 🎮 Gameplay balanced between stealth, puzzle-solving, and combat  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🔒 No open world—levels feel restrictive compared to successors  \r\n- 😰 Some players may find the claustrophobic setting limiting  \r\n- 📺 UI and presentation are dated compared to newer entries  \r\n\r\n---\r\nWalking into Arkham Asylum for the first time feels like stepping into a dark, twisted comic book come to life. Unlike many superhero games that try to capture the bustling streets of a city, Arkham Asylum chose lock itself into a confined, eerie space that shapes the entire experience. The facility feels like a living, breathing character—full of shadows, foreboding corridors, and the unsettling sense that something could go wrong at any moment.\r\n\r\nThe developers nailed the tone and atmosphere, delivering a gritty and oppressive horror vibe that sets this game apart from most superhero titles. Even the Halloween-inspired UI, the haunting sound design, and the dimly lit interiors all contribute to a palpable tension that keeps you on edge. It’s not just about punching thugs or solving puzzles; it’s about surviving in an insane place that feels as dangerous as the villains it holds.\r\n\r\nThe story wastes no time plunging you into Batman’s world. This is a Batman who is already fully formed, a dark knight with years of experience behind him. The game bypasses origin stories and goes straight to the confrontation with the Joker, a villain as chaotic as he is charismatic. The cast of characters you meet is rich and varied, featuring many of Batman’s iconic foes, each brought to life with remarkable fidelity to their comic book roots.\r\n\r\nThe combat system is one of the best parts of Arkham Asylum, setting a new standard when it first launched. The “freeflow” combat mechanic is fluid and intuitive, rewarding timing, counters, and creativity. Each encounter feels dynamic, whether you’re facing a single opponent or a group. The addition of gadgets and environmental takedowns adds depth without overwhelming the player. Its a shame that this kind of combat is not being used as much today by the industry, instead pivoting more to the endless Souls-like combat system games that we have today.\r\n\r\nStealth sections are well integrated, giving you the chance to sneak past enemies or take them down silently. This balance between combat and stealth makes the gameplay varied and prevents the experience from feeling repetitive.\r\n\r\nLevel design is tight and purposeful. Without the freedom of an open world, every corridor and room feels meticulously crafted to enhance the story and gameplay. There’s a constant feeling of progression, of peeling back layers of Arkham’s mystery as you advance. Though some players might find the lack of freedom to move restrictive, especially since Batman is known to operate as well in open areas like gliding and swinging through rooftops and buildings. Stil, the level design strengthened the narrative and mood, creating an intense, immersive, claustrophobic experience.\r\n\r\nThe game does show its age in some UI and graphical aspects, but its artistic direction still holds up well. The detailed character models and atmospheric lighting maintain a strong sense of immersion. Especially if you can play on PC which automatically gets you a sort of a \"remastered\" version with an unlocked framerate and resolution.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nEven more than a decade later, **Batman Arkham Asylum** stands as a landmark title that reshaped superhero games. Its compelling blend of tight combat, horror atmosphere, and strong narrative laid the groundwork for an acclaimed series. For anyone interested in Batman or action games with a dark twist, Arkham Asylum remains a must-play classic that rewards patience and skill with a uniquely immersive experience. It has a very different and unique vibe than the rest of games that you will either like it more or like it less than the other games in the series.",

    "title": "Expanding the Dark Knight’s Playground | Batman Arkham City Review",
    "description": "Batman Arkham City expands the series into an open-world setting, delivering more freedom, refined combat, and deep exploration, while maintaining the dark tone and tight gameplay.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "After the success of Arkham Asylum, **Batman Arkham City** took the Dark Knight’s adventures to an open-world playground inside a massive prison district of Gotham. This game was exactly what I hoped for, offering more freedom, diverse environments, and deeper gameplay without losing the series’ signature atmosphere.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🏙️ Open-world design offers more freedom and variety  \r\n- 🦸 Combat refined with new moves and multi-enemy counters  \r\n- 🐱 Playable Catwoman sections add diversity  \r\n- 🔓 Gradual unlocks keep progression engaging and balanced  \r\n- 🎨 Art direction that still looks stunning years later  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🐢 Slow initial pacing before the city opens up  \r\n- 🧩 Riddler collectibles can be tedious and frustrating  \r\n- 🏙️ Still feels like one long continuous mission more than true sandbox \r\n- 📖 Story can be all over the place \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow here is basically what I dreamed the next game should be while I was playing Asylum. Which is to do Open World. It's not the whole Gotham City unlike Open World Spider-Man games getting New York, but Arkham City is a nice compromise nonetheless. The game is now open world, and I feel more free in playing as Batman now. More city street environments, gliding in open world, grappling hook to climb buildings, and jumping rooftop to rooftop. The chance to play as Catwoman from time to time is just icing on the cake. It started slow, probably a factor why I couldn't really get into it, but once the city opens up it becomes loads of fun.\r\n\r\nArkham City’s open-world design lets you truly feel like you’re patrolling Gotham. The city feels dense and alive with its crowded rooftops, streets, and alleys, all bursting with activity and side content. Gliding through the cityscape on Batman’s cape and climbing with the grappling hook are incredibly satisfying, giving you a real sense of power and freedom. \r\n\r\nHowever, it still gives that feeling that the game is very large one continuous quest/mission, and it still felt a little claustrophobic because I was kinda stranded to Arkham City and its momentous event. I hated the now more annoying Riddler collectibles too and never bothered with that, as the sheer volume of collectibles can feel tedious and grindy, pulling you away from the main narrative at times.\r\n\r\nCombat has been polished further and much more fluid and easier to do combats, with new moves and counter mechanics that reward creativity, especially in larger groups. The ability to chain counters and fluidly transition between enemies makes fights feel exhilarating rather than repetitive. Multiple counters being my favorite added feature (similar to how it evolved in Assassin's Creed games). \r\n\r\nThe progression is also super engaging and It was awesome unlocking new stuff and the pace to unlock things are done just right it never really feels grindy. Unlocking new gear feels meaningful and encourages exploration.\r\n\r\nAdding playable Catwoman sections was a great move, offering fresh stealth gameplay with different mechanics and abilities. This variety keeps the experience interesting and adds narrative depth.\r\n\r\nGraphics wise, playing it 11 years later, it really aged exceptionally well especially how the art style is. Playing it on the Steam Deck, it can still go toe to toe with modern titles as far as visuals go (not to mention gameplay too), especially in today's blurry TAA/upscaling infested AAA market. I even beat like the last few hours of the story on my PC on a big monitor at max graphics and it still looked impressive and really aged very well! Arkham Asylum's graphics isn't much different from this so if you're worried about visuals not holding up in 2024 and beyond, don't worry, it still holds up.\r\n\r\nI do have some criticisms about the Story, it was all over the place. The main villain is severely underutilized in favor of yet again a more popular villain, who ends up dominating much of the narrative. All while unnecessarily shoehorning another popular villain as a key player as well, which can feel a bit forced or rushed, as if the game is trying to cram in as many iconic Batman characters as possible.\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n**Batman Arkham City** successfully expands the series’ formula into a vibrant urban playground while maintaining the core strengths of fluid combat, deep storytelling, and immersive stealth. It balances freedom and narrative in a way few superhero games have since. If Arkham Asylum set the stage, Arkham City truly lets you play the Dark Knight on your own terms.",

    "body": "**Batman Arkham Knight** is the pinnacle of the Arkham series, delivering the most expansive Gotham yet, refined combat mechanics, and the long-awaited introduction of the Batmobile as a playable vehicle. This title brings together everything fans loved and adds new dimensions, though it occasionally leans too heavily on vehicle combat segments.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🌆 Vast, detailed Gotham city full of side quests and secrets  \r\n- 🦇 Refined combat system with a broad moveset and gadgets  \r\n- 🚗 Playable Batmobile integrated into both combat and puzzle-solving  \r\n- 🎯 Engaging main story with memorable villains and twists  \r\n- 🎨 Excellent visuals and sound design pushing the series forward  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🚙 Over-reliance on Batmobile sequences and tank battles, to the point that it became annoying  \r\n- 🎮 Some boss fights feel repetitive or frustrating  \r\n- ⚙️ Performance issues, especially on less powerful hardware  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nArkham Knight offers the largest and most detailed open world in the series, packed with diverse environments ranging from gritty industrial zones to towering skyscrapers, as the open world is now a huge chunk of Gothan City itself. Traversing the city, whether gliding over rooftops or driving through the streets, feels exhilarating and immersive.\r\n\r\nThe combat system continues to impress, blending fluid freeflow mechanics with an extensive range of gadgets and combos. Batman’s agility and tactical prowess make each encounter satisfying, whether facing thugs, assassins, or supervillains.\r\n\r\nI found the story compelling and it has mostly kept me hooked from start to finish. It felt like a Hollywood-style high stakes Batman action movie, with enough twists and turns to keep things interesting. The use of villains were much more balanced here and much more detailed. However its seems that towards the tail end of the main story it ran out of fuel to make things interesting for me. Beyond the Main storyline, the side quests feel like they're an integral part of the main story, rather than just optional distractions. This side quests compelled me to actually complete them instead of ignoring most of them.\r\n\r\nAt first, I was actually invested in the Riddler side story now in this one after almost fully ignoring him in Arkham City and Origins (though I did manage to complete it in Asylum). That alone speaks for how compelling quests in general is for me. However after I was done with the main bulk of his side quest, it became annoying once again and we're back to IGNORING him again because of the forced collectibles. Although there is indeed a mod that allows you to skip the trophies to skip to the end part.\r\n\r\nA minor thing I hate though, is the jumpscares, because i hate jumpscares, and it being in this game, instead of a lets say horror where you can expect one every moment, really worsens it.\r\n\r\nAs with the main story, of course the game needs a grandiose event once again to provide that \"gameplay battleground\" just like Arkham City, and in some ways like in Arkham Asylum. It's a little bit disappointing not being able to play as Batman on a regular night in Gotham, like in Batman Arkham Origins, but I guess for the sake of good gameplay and open world level design it has to happen.\r\n\r\nHow they explained the world’s state — the lack of civilians and regular people — it was done decently anyway. My only gripe/pet peeve is that they hired Jonathan Banks to voice commissioner Gordon, and every time I hear his voice, I hear Mike from Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul, and I just can't stop associating his voice from it.\r\n\r\nThe long awaited introduction of a playable Batmobile finally is pretty awesome, as we never got to use it playing the previous three games. However, I couldn’t help but feel that there’s too much reliance on it, perhaps it is forced too much on the player. Tank battles are so frequent that I'm almost playing a tank combat game instead of a Batman game. The heavy tank combat use at certain points detracts from the Batman experience. Almost every point of my annoyance in the gameplay is related to the Batmobile segments or boss fights, especially towards the end of the game like this one specific chase/drill boss fight.\r\n\r\nHowever aside from this, all the other Batmobile aspects are done very well. How it is incorporated to the puzzle solving mechanics is done beautifully, as well as the ability to remote control the car and use it in certain situations. The pathfinding and how you call the batmobile is pretty badass too and done really well. Handling is pretty good for the most part and you can easily drive like Batman throughout Gotham City, barring some minor physics quirkiness especially if you're trying some jumps or high speed maneuvers, which are kinda annoying too but it didn't detract much from the overall experience.\r\n\r\nThe skill progression and challenges in the game = well done. The best in the series, gone are the Origins type of progression where you need specific challenges to unlock stuff, and back are the XP/Skill point based unlocks of Arkham City, albeit done with more both style and substance.\r\n\r\nAs for the combat, it also feels like the peak of the series in terms of mechanics, with a wide range of moves and gadgets that allow for creative gameplay, which are also well integrated with the aforementioned progression system. However, the combat feels a bit too \"arcadey\" now, compared to the more grounded, tactical approach of the earlier games. While it might be easier and feels more video game-y, it’s undeniably fun and offers plenty of variety for players who enjoy experimenting with different combos and strategies.\r\n\r\nOne more criticism I have for this game is the optimization, which can be justified because the game has really good visuals for its time anyway, and can even pass as a game made today. Nowadays though, you can pretty much brute force good performance in this game with new hardware, but I can still feel the stutters sometimes. On the Steam Deck in which I play when I'm out of the house, Arkham Knight is the only game in the Batman Arkham series that failed to have a locked 60fps experience, with dips to the high 30s.\r\n\r\nThis is just simply The peak Batman video game experience. Gameplay wise its the ultimate evolution of what has been done in previous games. Level design-wise, its also the ultimate evolution because you now get a bigger open world that feels much more like a real City. Still not a huge New York city like in the Spider-Man games, but a city that feels like a city nonetheless. It feels detailed and immersive enough to give a real sense of scale.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n**Batman Arkham Knight** stands as a fitting and thrilling conclusion to the Arkham saga, delivering a rich, expansive Batman experience with many memorable moments. While it occasionally stumbles with an overemphasis on Batmobile combat and minor technical issues that has since been mostly bruteforced by modern hardware anyway, it remains a must-play for fans of the series and superhero action games in general.",

    "description": "Batman Arkham Origins is a solid prequel that refines the series’ formula, offering a darker story and a more open Gotham, but it falls short of the polish and impact of its predecessors.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "**Batman Arkham Origins** serves as a worthy prequel to the acclaimed Arkham series, exploring Batman’s early years as a vigilante in Gotham. While it refines many elements of the series’ formula and offers a darker, grittier narrative, it struggles to reach the polish and impact of its predecessors.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🌃 More open and detailed Gotham city to explore  \r\n- 🦸 Familiar, fluid combat with refinements  \r\n- 🎯 Intriguing story focusing on younger Batman’s struggles  \r\n- 🔓 Improved mission variety and side content  \r\n- 🎨 Strong voice acting and atmospheric audio  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🐢 Progression system feels more restrictive and less rewarding  \r\n- 🏙️ Some missions feel repetitive and padded  \r\n- ⚙️ Technical glitches and bugs occasionally break immersion  \r\n\r\n---\r\nI don't really get the hate for Origins, especially in retrospect when newer Batman games have come out. Origins just continued the Batman Arkham series, retained most of the gameplay and refined it, while introducing a new story, a prequel at that. Its sad that this game gets flak even up to now and not even considered as part of the series in some releases, like being omitted from the \"Arkham Trilogy\" release.\r\n\r\nLike other Arkham games though and contrary to the \"Origins\" title, we still get an experienced Batman here, albeit way less than previous games, and still skips right past the actual origin of the character. I feel like the story here is better than City purely because it is paced better and isn't as convoluted. The setup of assassins being hired to take down Batman is actually dope AF in setting him up for these various villains, no overly complicated reason for every one of these villains was needed other than just the \"kill batman contract\". You also get intrigued with what happened in Batman's early years, such has his early interactions with Police, Gordon, Barbara, Alfred, and the Villains.\r\n\r\nThe open world also feels much better for me. It now feels like a regular night in Gotham because there isn't a hellish grandiose event happening, unlike in Arkham Asylum or City where it goes to hell and you're stuck in it. It even reinforces that feeling by allowing you to go back to the Batcave any time and you can fast travel around the city. The game features several interesting side quests and activities, though some can feel repetitive and padded, diminishing the overall pace. \r\n\r\nI still hate the Riddler collectibles. Yet again, similar but not to the same extent as in Arkham City, the main villain is underutilized in favor of THAT villain, who ends up dominating much of the narrative yet again. \r\n\r\nOne additional thing I disliked about it was the progression system which was a huge step back, and how restrictive it felt compared to Arkham City. Upgrades are now locked behind unrelated upgrades, and some upgrades require completing specific challenges instead of being unlocked with the usual skill points gained from leveling up.\r\n\r\nThe graphics look awesome as well and have aged well, but there are diminishing returns from Asylum/City and it doesn't look much significantly better but consumed way more resources than Asylum and City. I like the new Batsuit, although it is more live action-looking instead of comic-book looking. While others may say it breaks immersion by being more advanced than the later Batsuits, you can kinda make sense of it by explaining that Batman needed more protection in his early years, while in the later years he is more confident now of his skills, and prefers to reduce protection for better agility. Or the Batsuit tech has improved that it has less volume for the same amount of protection.\r\n\r\nCombat remains tight and satisfying, closely following the successful freeflow system. The refinements make fights feel smoother, especially with new gadgets and counter moves. However, the progression system is a step back, locking upgrades behind unrelated challenges or missions rather than straightforward skill points, which can feel frustrating.\r\n\r\nTechnical issues, such as bugs and occasional frame drops, sometimes pull you out of the immersive experience, but the strong voice acting and sound design largely compensate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWhile **Batman Arkham Origins** may not reach the heights set by Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, it remains a worthwhile prequel that deepens Batman’s lore and offers a compelling, if rougher, take on the Dark Knight’s early vigilante days. Fans seeking a darker narrative and expanded Gotham will find plenty to enjoy despite its flaws. If you want to play the whole series from start, Definitely don't skip it.",

    "description": "Avowed surprised me with a deep RPG experience, blending strong exploration, tactical combat, and meaningful roleplaying despite some frustrations with loot and scaling.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "I went into **Avowed** with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much the game offered. While it clearly borrows from the Elder Scrolls formula, it carves out its own identity with strong RPG and skill check elements, tactical combat, and a large, immersive world.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🌄 Large and beautifully detailed world with rewarding exploration  \r\n- ⚔️ Tactical, skill-based combat that requires strategy and timing  \r\n- 🎭 Deep dialogue system with impactful skill checks and roleplaying options  \r\n- 📚 Helpful lore and contextual in-game explanations that keep you immersed  \r\n- 🎨 Impressive Unreal Engine 5 visuals that bring the world to life, one of the best utilizations to date\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🎲 Loot can be inconsistent and frustrating, especially for magic builds  \r\n- ⚖️ Combat and progression scaling feel uneven, limiting the sense of power growth  \r\n- 🛠️ Tedious looting and inventory management that can break immersion  \r\n\r\n---\r\n**Avowed** has been getting a lot of undeserved hate lately, like many others that have launched recently (e.g., Veilguard or KCD2) or are upcoming (Intergalactic, AC Shadows, Ghost of Yotei). Many complaints dismiss it as \"woke,\" label it as \"Xbox Game Pass slop,\" or criticize it for not living up to Skyrim's standards, lumping it in with genuine trainwrecks like Concord or Suicide Squad. Honestly, that couldn’t be further from the truth.\r\n\r\nAvowed’s world is vast and varied, ranging from sprawling ruins and ancient temples to dense forests and bustling settlements. The attention to detail is remarkable, with environmental storytelling woven throughout every location. The visuals are impressive, showcasing some of the best uses of Unreal Engine 5 with dynamic lighting, detailed textures, and impressive weather effects that truly enhance the atmosphere. The performance isn't half bad either, compared to other UE5 titles which are mostly bad in terms of optimization, especially regarding stuttering.\r\n\r\nI didn’t go into this expecting a Skyrim clone, nor did I want one. Sure, it doesn’t have the same living, breathing open world or the NPC shenanigans The Elder Scrolls is known for, which most online video comparisons focus on. But where it absolutely shines is in the actual roleplaying: the companions (albeit limited), dialogue choices, exploration, and, without a doubt, the combat. \r\n\r\nThe dialogue system features impactful skill checks that affect how conversations unfold and how you can roleplay your character. What I appreciated too was the in-game lore and explanations provided during dialogue, which helped keep me grounded in the world without needing to consult external sources.\r\n\r\nComing fresh from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, this game feels like a natural extension, with a huge emphasis on exploring ruins and wilds, opening hidden passageways, and using parkour. For its limited open world, the exploration is fantastic. \r\n\r\nCombat in Avowed on the other hand is tactical and engaging. It requires you to pay close attention to positioning, timing, and resource management, especially when using magic or ranged attacks. Unlike many action RPGs that encourage button mashing, Avowed rewards deliberate play and experimentation.\r\n\r\nHowever, the loot is underwhelming. Whether it's my build, RNG, or just bad luck, the rewards rarely feel exciting. For my magic-focused build, I’ve found six shields and not a single wand. This tedium almost negates the fun of exploration. Manually looting every single body for scraps is a chore, especially when they are hard to spot. There should be a more streamlined system for this by now.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade system is simplified, for better or worse. On the plus side, it allows you to carry a favorite early-game weapon through to the end. While the option to respec is welcome, the high cost discourages experimentation. I would have preferred it to be free.\r\n\r\nCombat scaling also feels weird, reminiscent of Skyrim's level-scaling. Despite leveling up, I never felt significantly more powerful, though my resource management did improve. The dialogue includes skill checks, which is a great touch for roleplaying, but their outcomes can feel inconsistent. For example, passing a high-level \"Might\" check might still lead to a fight instead of successfully intimidating an opponent.\r\n\r\nAs for the world, I didn't find it confusing. I haven’t played Pillars, but I watched a few \"Before You Play\" videos, which may have helped. The game also includes a feature I love: a button you can press during dialogue to get context on highlighted lore terms, similar to Final Fantasy XVI and Metaphor. It’s a great way to keep players immersed without resorting to heavy-handed exposition.\r\n\r\nI would give it a 7/10. It's by no means a bad game, but it feels like a \"filler game\" to me. I would recommend getting it on Game Pass or waiting for a deep sale. Despite its flaws, the game succeeds in creating a rich, atmospheric RPG world. The blend of narrative depth, exploration, and tactical combat kept me invested for over 60 hours.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nAvowed is a solid RPG that shines in exploration, combat, RP-ing, and storytelling, even if it stumbles on loot quality and its not the living breathing open world people want it to be. For players craving a deep, immersive RPG experience with meaningful roleplaying and a richly crafted world, Avowed is well worth your time, especially if you can look past its rougher edges.",

    "description": "The series fell hard, but Battlefield 6 has managed to pull off an",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "The *Battlefield* franchise has always been defined by its signature military sandbox - a large-scale, combined arms experience where infantry, vehicles, and aircraft clash across sprawling maps with destructible environments. The goal is mass chaos, but within a framework of team and objective play. After the disastrous launch of *Battlefield 2042*, the pressure on *Battlefield 6* was immense.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n* 🎯 Best-in-Class Gunplay: Excellent, weighty gunfeel with good TTK (Time to Kill)\r\n* 🏃 Fluid Movement and Great implementation of modern movement mechanics (sliding, crouch sprinting) without becoming overly twitchy.\r\n* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Successful return to the classic Class system, correcting the mistakes of its predecessor.\r\n* 💣 Visceral Atmosphere: The \"War Atmosphere\", sound design, and special effects are the most intense DICE has ever delivered.\r\n* ✨ Insanely optimized and achieves high visual fidelity and frame rates with traditional rasterization methods, running smoothly with modest hardware requirements.\r\n* 🎧 War Tapes V.A.L.: Enhanced audio mix creates an unparalleled, gritty soundscape.\r\n\r\nCons\r\n\r\n* 🗺️ Awful Map Design: Maps are too small, poorly balanced, and chaotic, creating constant exposure with no breathing room.\r\n* 🚗 Worst Vehicle Experience: Small maps and missing features severely limit vehicle effectiveness and fun.\r\n* 📅 Broken Challenges: Initially ridiculous and poorly tracking challenges hampered early progression (though being patched).\r\n* 📉 Feature Stagnation: Lacks the evolutionary leap expected, missing popular features like Levolution and dynamic weather from past titles.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was the hardest return I’ve seen in recent years. The series fell hard, but *Battlefield 6* has managed to pull off an undeniable turnaround, leading to one of the biggest selling launches in the franchise's history. It’s a massive comeback, succeeding where its predecessor failed. However, behind that success, *Battlefield 6* still doesn't quite hit the notes required to be considered the ultimate *Battlefield* experience.\r\n\r\nIt took me some time before I was able to write a review for this game. I had to play for 60+hrs of multiplayer in a span of two months, leveling up past 50, playing different classes, weapons, vehicles, as well as reminiscing back the good old Battlefield 3 and 4 days to really get a feel of the game and formulate my thoughts on it.\r\n\r\n## Pinpoint Gunplay and Fluid Movement\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the gunplay is good, amazing even. For me, this entry boasts the best gunplay in the series. Weapons feel weighty and satisfying, and the Time-to-Kill (TTK) balancing is spot on. It hits the perfect sweet spot I haven't felt since the days of *Battlefield 3* and *4*, perhaps even better now because back then I had to play at 100-200ms due to our poor country’s internet services. They’ve made the gunplay just right this time, it’s not so long that you’re frustrated watching enemies escape a continuous stream of bullets, but it’s not so short that you have zero fighting chance in a 1v1 where the enemy got the drop on you.\r\n\r\nCrucially, excellent gunplay is only going to take you so far if the movement feels clunky, and the good news is that the movement is on par. It never feels like you're fighting against the controls. You move exactly as you intend, and the developers have provided modern, well-implemented options: crouch sprinting, sliding, leaning, and mounting guns. They've fine-tuned these mechanics nicely since the beta, ensuring the movement is responsive without ever devolving into the blazing fast, \"boomer shooter\" feel of a *Call of Duty* title. Although there was a little bit of worry in the beta because people were still bunny hopping around too fast, but the devs have patched it out on release.\r\n\r\n## A Well-Defined Class Structure\r\n\r\nThe customization of guns is another very well-implemented feature. While the UI can be initially confusing to navigate - it’s not the most user-friendly (in fact, it sucks) - the depth is impressive. There’s a large number of attachments to unlock, providing a constant sense of progression. Earning a new foregrip, suppressor, scope, or extended mag size all contributes to making your chosen weapons feel slightly more competitive and enjoyable to play. The early grinding to unlock these attachments was atrocious in the first two weeks, but they patched it out soon after, making the progression feel much more natural and rewarding.\r\n\r\nAs for the soldier classes, they are in the best state ever amongst all the *Battlefield* games, thankfully moving away from the disastrous operator systems seen in *Battlefield 2042*. I find myself equally using all four classes because they are all viable and unique:\r\n\r\n* Assault is fun with the crucial spawn beacon, allowing constant, effective flank and capture support. Its signature gadget the Adrenaline Injector sucks, but the spawn beacon and ladder makes up for it.\r\n* Engineer is the competitive choice against the game's heavy armor and air threats, or if you prefer to pilot yourself to get bonuses for your vehicle.\r\n* Support is the backbone of the team, equipped to handle revive, health, ammo, and even cover via a shield. It has everything to keep it going.\r\n* Recon is surprisingly fun, allowing you to dominate the leaderboards with single-digit kills purely through spotting and flanking with the drone, before switching to sniping if the situation demands.\r\n\r\n## Visceral War Atmosphere and Destruction\r\n\r\nOne of the most important parts of the *Battlefield* franchise, especially since its transition to the Frostbite engine, is the \"War Atmosphere\" and the Destructible Environments. I can confidently say they turned it up a notch here this time. The sheer volume of special effects is incredible: more explosions, more camera shake, and more intense particle effects that add a palpable weight to all the chaos. It feels like DICE’s most intense war atmosphere to date among the games it has made.\r\n\r\nThe visuals themselves are nothing short of amazing. The game looks great and achieves its modernity by using traditional raster methods, focusing on a higher level of fidelity, detailed models, crisp textures, and a weighty atmosphere. When that chopper is going down, or when an apartment floor is collapsing, or when a tank is fuming flames ready to explode, that's *Battlefield* looking at its best.\r\n\r\nHowever, the destruction is still quite limited and state-based. It isn’t dynamically freeing like in games where you can level an entire building floor-by-floor, nor does it offer the systemic freedom of *Bad Company 2* where you could essentially wipe the entire map clean. Despite this limitation, *Battlefield 6* is still near the top when it comes to visual destruction spectacles. It still doesn’t beat *The Finals* when it comes to really dynamic and cool looking destructible environments.\r\n\r\n## Audio and Technical Masterclass\r\n\r\nThe sound quality, as usual, is best in class for a war game thanks to the enhanced audio options. Specifically, the game features the enhanced 'War Tapes V.A.L. (Very Aggressive Listening)' setting. This is a special audio mix that compresses the dynamic range and adds distortion to create an incredibly intense, visceral soundscape—tank engines rumbling, explosions ringing in your ears, and heavy gunfire crackling all around you.\r\n\r\nIt delivers a raw, impactful feeling. However, if you need precise directional audio for competitive play or want to hear enemy footsteps clearly, settings like High Dynamics or the default mix are better choices. War Tapes is for immersion first.\r\n\r\nI must also note that the game is ultra-optimized. It achieves this level of fidelity without taxing the hardware, running smoothly on systems far lower than the usual modern AAA requirement. I found I didn't need upscaling technology like DLSS to push my frame rates past 100, which is a rare feat in today's market.\r\n\r\n## The Caveats\r\n\r\nDespite all these triumphs, the game’s score is held back by critical, fundamental flaws in design.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the maps are terribly balanced and too small, even the large Conquest ones. There are simply too many flanks, entry ways, and rooftops, leading to chaotic, unfun mess rather than strategic engagements. There is no breathing room; you see enemies everywhere, in every direction, even if you just try to capture a far away point. The spawns are too close and too easily visible by the enemy on the other side of the maps. The map design has seemingly over-corrected the issues of *2042 (which had the maps too big)*, but the result is that there are no viable play styles other than fast flanking or sitting on an unreachable roof. The objectives are so tiny and lanes are so close that every fight feels identical.\r\n\r\nThis issue is compounded by the fact that for vehicles, this is probably the worst *Battlefield* up to this point. Small maps mean aircraft constantly hit the outside combat zone warning (You’ll be surprised at how small the combat zone for aircraft is, even given the small map size) There are missing features like the Little Bird and a complete absence of jet unlocks. The limited map space simply doesn't allow for the tactical vehicle play the series is known for.\r\n\r\nFinally, while the classes are great, the initial challenge system was a serious failure. The challenges were initially ridiculous, some were broken, and others were poorly worded. Tasks like \"Get 10 takedowns (melee) in a single match\" or \"3000 vehicle repairs in a single life\" seemed impossible in a normal organically game without luck or cheesing. The good news is the developers have acknowledged this and are actively patching them, but it was a frustrating hurdle during the launch window.\r\n\r\n## **Conclusion**\r\n\r\n*Battlefield 6* is a technical marvel in terms of gunplay and optimization, and a successful return to form thanks to its class system. However, it feels like a step backward in some key ways, lacking features like fortification, dynamic weather and *Levolution* (Events that changed the entire map, like a Dam breaking or a Skyscraper collapsing) that made older titles feel evolutionary. More importantly, the core map design actively works against the series' strengths, limiting tactical freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is a game built on the best core mechanics *Battlefield* has ever produced, but those mechanics are frequently suffocated by the environments they are contained within. My score falls short of 8, At 7.8/10, it is an excellent military shooter, but still not the ultimate *Battlefield* experience I had hoped for.",

The narrative layers multiple plot threads, character arcs, and world history that unravels gradually, rewarding players who invest time into exploration and dialogue, and playing with your emotions in ways you cannot even imagine.\r\n\r\nThe combat offers a refreshing twist by combining the deliberate tactics of turn-based battles with bursts of real-time action. This hybrid system keeps fights engaging and unpredictable, requiring both strategic planning and quick reflexes.\r\n\r\n You’ll manage a party with diverse skills, timing your moves and use of skills carefully to maximize effectiveness. Each encounter challenges you to balance offense, defense, and crowd control, and the different resource systems unique to each characters, while positioning and timing (parrying, dodging, etc) remain crucial for success. \r\n\r\nFor the majority of the game, you can freely change your three-person party composition anywhere outside of combat. This allows you to adapt to changing battle conditions, exploit enemy weaknesses, and experiment with different builds without being locked into one role. It adds a layer of strategic depth that is usually seen in turn-based games, encouraging creativity and thoughtful planning. All playable characters are well-balanced and handled in a very unique way. They aren't your typical mage, warrior, or rogue archetypes but something much more special, to the point that you'll need to take time to read their different skills and effects to understand each character's intended playstyle. Although at only 5-6 characters, its a bit on the low side in terms of total party members.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-06-06-clair-obscur-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"2024 Games of The Year\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\nThe voice acting is remarkably polished for an indie title, and its immensely surprising to me that they even managed to land all heavy hitter actors like Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings), Charlie Cox (Daredevil), Ben Starr (Final Fantasy XVI), and Jennifer English (Baldur's Gate 3). All providing emotional depth to characters that elevates the storytelling. Coupled with a haunting soundtrack, the audio design plays a crucial role in setting the tone throughout the adventure.\r\n</div>\r\nOutside of combat, exploration and narrative progression intertwine smoothly. The game really has that \"Expedition\" vibes as they presented with the title. The world is richly detailed with lore and story threads from previous Expeditions that reward attention and curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe actual Exploration in terms of game mechanics in the levels and the grandier overworld, however, is less refined. Moving through the levels and interacting with objects can feel awkward, which sometimes interrupts immersion. Combat initiation mechanics also occasionally disrupt pacing, as battles can be awkward to trigger.\r\n\r\nSemi puzzle elements and a small handful of side quests and interactibles intersperse battles, providing variety and moments of respite, without the game feeling overcrowded. The game’s UI and controls, while generally effective, occasionally feel a bit clunky, but they don’t significantly detract from the overall experience.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-06-06-clair-obscur-5.avif\r\n    alt=\"2024 Games of The Year\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n\\*\\*Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\\*\\* is a living proof that turn-based games still has a place in this world, and a big slap to Final Fantasy for leaving that formula for something more action-focused and real time. While the game isn't that lengthy - story and gameplay wise - compared to other JRPG offerings, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 stands out as an inventive and compelling entry in the turn-based JRPG genre, offering a fresh take that’s sure to captivate fans seeking challenge, narrative, and emotional depth.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-06-06-clair-obscur-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"2024 Games of The Year\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n## Conclusion:\r\n\r\n**Clair Obscur: Expedition 33** is a bold and creative entry in the turn-based RPG genre. Its combination of real-time elements, strong narrative, and impressive voice work create a unique masterclass experience that will appeal to players seeking both strategic combat and immersive storytelling, despite some rough edges in exploration and UI. A very well rounded game that excels in all aspects: Gameplay, Story, Acting, Graphics, and Music. It is clear a forerunner for 2025's Game oF The Year Award.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "description": "The stars finally lined up, and I was able to play Cyberpunk 2077",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "There has been a lot of discourse about Cyberpunk 2077, one of the biggest games to come out in the last five years, and one that has seen its own share of controversies and backlash from its poorly received launch until the developers slowly fixed their game over time to what it is today. \r\n\r\nI waited patiently until the game was adequately patched up, and then waited even more. I wanted to experience it with the hardware ready to run it at full path tracing (something that was only added post-release) and enough free time to give it the attention it deserves.\r\n\r\nThe stars finally lined up, and I was able to play Cyberpunk 2077 almost five years after its release. Honestly, I didn’t even know what to expect. My hype and expectations for the game have been on a rollercoaster these past few years, but I can honestly say the experience of playing it for the first time in 2025 was still beyond what I expected, given its history.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n* 🖋️The storytelling feels premium and really rivals the best books, movies, or games out there.\r\n* 🏙️ The world-building and quest design is incredibly detailed, making Night City feel alive and believable. \r\n* ❤️Side quest content is absolutely on par with the quality of the main quest.\r\n* 🎭 The performances, especially by Keanu Reeves, are breathtaking, adding a lot of depth to the story. \r\n* 🎮 The gameplay offers impressive variety and player choice, making the gameplay even more immersive on top of the story and roleplaying mechanics.\r\n* 🌟  With path tracing on, the visuals are some of the most photorealistic and stunning I’ve ever seen.\r\n### Cons\r\n* 🐞 A few engine quirks and bugs still punctuate an otherwise smooth experience. \r\n* 🚗 Driving in first person is practically unplayable, making third-person a necessity. \r\n\r\n### A Consistently 'Preem' Experience All Around\r\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition includes Phantom Liberty, which is an expansion that adds a sizeable middle chapter to the story. Right from the start, I have to say Phantom Liberty’s content is much better and more refined than the main quest, but the main game still stands strong on its own.\r\n\r\nJumping in, the first thing that stands out is just how consistently premium 'preem' the storytelling feels across the board. The story is crafted at a level you rarely see, the kind of writing and world-building usually reserved for the very best books, movies, or games out there. Night City is truly out of this world. There is so much depth, atmosphere, and detail in every mission and interaction, every single quest, side mission, and even random gig feels like it had real care and attention.\r\n\r\nIn other games, there's the main quest and the side quests, and the side quests are usually filler content, full of padding and often forgettable or boring. In Cyberpunk 2077, though, both the main quest and side quests are on par in terms of quality and design; you’d think that everything is part of the main quest. It compels you to just keep questing and questing, doing every single thing in the game because everything feels genuinely high-quality, from the support character questlines to even simple “Odd Jobs” side quests that you might stumble upon while roaming around. Then there’s the actual “filler content” called Gigs, but even as the third or fourth-rate option, they’re still very compelling and never boring.\r\n\r\nThe developers went far beyond the basics, putting effort into even minor flavor like text messages, emails, video calls, and even dynamic loading screens at the start of every session, that shift depending on your progress and the world’s current events. \r\n\r\n### Breathtaking Performance\r\nThe cast performance is stellar, with performances that are nothing short of breathtaking. Keanu Reeves leads the pack, and it’s insane to think that he has more dialogue here than in most of his movies, especially in his John Wick films, imagine the sheer volume of lines for a role like this, and it shows in the game’s emotional punch. The rest of the cast matches this energy, bringing Night City’s citizens to life in a way that makes even brief encounters memorable.\r\n\r\n### Your Choices REALLY Matter\r\nThe gunplay and overall gameplay surprised me. Compared to many RPG shooter games that can feel floaty or disconnected, Cyberpunk 2077 delivers combat with real weight and variety. You get a ridiculous amount of freedom in how you approach every mission, whether going loud with heavy hitters like a shotgun, ARs, powerful revolver, or using silenced weapons, or even high-tech weaponry with auto-targeting mechanisms. Maybe you don’t want to fight at all and prefer hacking your way through or sneaking past enemies. That said, the progression tree is not the most compelling; some of the most attractive perks, in my opinion, are buried deep behind others you may not care for. Despite the ability to respec, the skill point requirements to access higher-tier perks make experimenting with new playstyles tough unless you commit a lot of points.\r\n\r\nThe game is almost entirely in first person, which adds to the immersion, except for the driving, which is playable in third person. And you know why? It’s because the first person driving sucks, it just doesn’t work. The angle is too low, the FOV is too narrow, there are no functional mirrors to use, and the camera just shakes and deviates too much from what’s ahead of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nRoleplaying-wise,  one of the game’s strongest points is the impact of your choices. Both the main story and Phantom Liberty branch into multiple, truly 100% different outcomes, far more than just a final cutscene or slightly different epilogue scene. Entire late-game sections completely change depending on what you do, which brings a rare sense of consequence and immersion but also means certain characters WILL be underdeveloped depending on your path. To see every layer of the story and the characters, multiple playthroughs are essentially required. \r\n\r\nThat said, when it comes to roleplaying “skill checks”, I felt the game was still lacking. There are only a limited number of meaningful skill checks throughout the whole playthrough, and most of my skills didn’t feel very useful or impactful regardless if I leveled them or not. \r\n\r\n### The Best Of The Best In Graphics\r\nVisually, especially with path tracing mode enabled, Cyberpunk 2077 is about as beautiful as games come, even for a five year old game (path tracing mode was added post release, though). The lighting difference in path tracing versus regular ray tracing or no ray tracing is huge, and especially at night and with the proper HDR/brightness configuration, the visuals transforms into something almost photorealistic. There are quirks, though: for all the impressive environments and lighting, character models can still look plasticky or off at times, breaking a bit of the immersion. \r\n\r\nAnd while performance is far better than at launch, a bit of the signature jank and rough edges from the engine are still around, expect the occasional physics bug or odd questing logic moment that reminds you it’s a sprawling open-world beast.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nAfter almost five years of wild ups and downs, major and minor patches, and a full-blown expansion, Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition delivered for me an experience that feels worthy of its hype five years ago. When everything comes together, it’s a must-play RPG and a technical showcase, filled with moments of storytelling and world-building that live up to the game's ambitions. There are still some rough spots, but the sheer quality of the narrative, the breathtaking city, the performances, and how truly different your story can turn out make this the best time to lose yourself in Night City.",

    "description": "Death Stranding 2 refines the unique, contemplative gameplay of its predecessor with polished mechanics, an epic story, and a bold, niche approach that challenges mainstream gaming norms.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "**Death Stranding 2** picks up the thread of its predecessor, expanding upon the contemplative, atmospheric journey that divided opinion when the first game released back in 2019 but still stands out for its unique vision, even more so now that the sequel has released. It takes everything that worked and refines it, delivering a game that is as much about emotional connection and storytelling as it is about traversal and survival.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🎵 An epic and haunting soundtrack that deeply enhances the emotional impact  \r\n- 🗺️ Vast and meticulously crafted open world that rewards exploration and patience  \r\n- 🚶 A bold design choice to minimize fast travel, emphasizing the journey itself  \r\n- 🕹️ Polished traversal and vehicle mechanics that add depth and variety  \r\n- 🎭 Rich narrative with a star-studded cast and complex character development  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- ⚖️ Gameplay difficulty reduced from the first, less challenging for veterans  \r\n- 🔄 Frequent vehicle use sometimes diminishes the challenge of terrain traversal  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-09-death-stranding-2-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Death Stranding 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\nThe world of Death Stranding 2 is a stunning, somber landscape that invites you to slow down and take it all in. While most open-world games treat traversal as a chore to be skipped with fast travel, Death Stranding 2 once again makes the journey its central pillar. The challenge, the reward, and the true gameplay loop are not found at the destination cities, but out in the vast, unforgiving wilderness. The game is about the meticulous planning of your route, the management of your cargo's weight, and the struggle against the elements.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe core mechanic of Death Stranding 2 is about moving across varied and often treacherous but immensely cathartically beautiful terrain, using a range of vehicles and tools to navigate mountains, rivers, and obstacles. The idea that this game is a \"Walking Simulator\" is a complete and total misnomer that stems from a misunderstanding of its gameplay. While traversal is the main focus, that's precisely what sets this game apart from everything else. It's truly an experience you have to play to believe.\r\n\r\nThe traversal mechanics have seen significant improvements from the first game. Not all of them I liked, but I think its for the better. Players have a variety of vehicles and methodsat their disposal — a tri-cruise, a four wheel truck, a surfboard, and many more that you will discover when playing — allowing more dynamic movement across varied terrain. Yet, the game retains the challenge of negotiating difficult landscapes on foot, requiring thoughtful navigation, balance, and resource management. \r\n\r\nI love the feeling of traveling in this game. Unlike other titles where I would just follow a waypoint and beeline from point A to B without thinking, here the journey itself is the fun. The process is methodical and tactical: constantly scanning the terrain to find the safest path, checking the map for elevation changes, and carefully managing the weight of your cargo along with the equipment you need. It’s all part of a delivering a satisfying gameplay loop.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-09-death-stranding-2-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Death Stranding 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nEven the simple act of moving is a deep mechanic. The constant micromanagement of steadying your stance on uneven ground, and scanning every square foot of terrain for dangers, while also managing cargo weight and stamina, which creates a realistic sense of effort and vulnerability. Planning routes to avoid hazards, conserve resources, or to know which tool to bring becomes a strategic puzzle, rewarding patience and foresight. \r\n</div>\r\nThis philosophy is reinforced by a host of brilliantly weird mechanics that are tailored specifically to this experience. The \"Strand System,\" for example, is a unique form of asymmetric social multiplayer. What other game lets you send \"Likes\" to another player's perfectly placed ladder that helped you, which in turn makes more of their helpful structures appear in your game? This creates a compelling social loop where you are also motivated to build something useful in a clever spot just to earn Likes from others. These mechanics blend seamlessly with the environmental storytelling, making every journey feel personal and reflective.\r\n\r\nThe narrative remains a major selling point and only bolsters the strong quality offering of the game in literally all fronts. Boasting a star-studded cast that brings gravitas and nuance to an already complex script. Sprinkled with that trademark Hideo Kojima weirdness going on that only he can pull off. The story explores themes of connection, isolation, and the human condition in a fragmented world, continuing Kojima’s tradition of cinematic storytelling filled with mystery and emotional depth.\r\n\r\nAlthough some players, especially first game veterans, might find the gameplay easier this time around - which could lessen the sense of accomplishment. However the trade off is the gains in accessibility, the game is now easier and the pacing is better, you get a vehicle pretty early in the story, making it more inviting to newcomers. \r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-09-death-stranding-2-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Death Stranding 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nHowever, vehicle reliance, while expanding and making the traversal options easier, can at times trivialize parts of the exploration, reducing the tactile thrill of on-foot travel. There is a big disconnect between the screenshots or photomade shared on the internet (which are mostly on foot) and the actual gameplay, in which you will be probably using a vehicle or a fast form of travel for the majority of your traversal. I just wish they made more areas inaccessible or harder to drive on that you'd prefer moving on foot, but it's almost never the case for 95% of my experience.\r\n</div>\r\nAnother thing that has significantly improved over the first game is the combat, as combat is now more frequent and intense, relying on a combination of a plethora of firearms, tools, and gadgets. When confronted by hostile entities or supernatural threats, players could rely on stealth, or use brute force firepower. Kinda some ways, it feels similar to MGSV with regards to the combat system, gunplay included. The delivery system is directly tied to the progression system and you get access to more equipment by delivering more cargo.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-09-death-stranding-2-5.avif\r\n    alt=\"Death Stranding 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n\r\nThe overall immersion created by the music, story, and visuals is breathtaking. While playing, I constantly interrupted myself just to enter photo mode, admire the view, and take scenic shots. In fact, I basically paused every few minutes to take pictures, even during the cutscenes. The detailed world design and subtle cues scattered across the map reward curiosity and reflection, inviting players to engage deeply with its themes. The game is that beautiful and its probably the most good looking game I've played this year, excelling on every level with its technical photorealism, stunning visual quality, and masterful artistic direction. Let's me be clear: **Death Stranding 2** is a masterpiece of visual design and technical fidelity. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most stunning games ever created, setting a new benchmark for what is possible in real-time graphics. Not to mention that it is incredible optimized, as it is able to run at 1440p60fps on the base PS5 despite looking as good as it is, while also delivering blazing fast 1-2 second loading times from main menu to gameplay.\r\n</div>\r\nThe game is a feast not just for the eyes, but for the ears as well as the music is absolutely fire. A big part of its unique atmosphere comes from its use of licensed, real-world music rather than a traditional orchestral score composed specifically for the game. This approach grounds the experience in a tangible reality, creating moments of startling beauty and reflection. In my opinion, I think more games and developers should explore using licensed tracks, even if licensing is difficult, as it can forge a powerful and distinct emotional connection that a conventional soundtrack sometimes can't.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-09-death-stranding-2-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Death Stranding 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n\r\n<div> \r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n**Death Stranding 2** is a bold artistic achievement that pushes the boundaries of what games can be. It succeeds by doubling down on the core design philosophy that made the original so unique: the entire game is built around the journey, not the destination. When you combine that philosophy with stunning visuals, perfectly curated soundtrack, an addicting gameplay loop, masterful storytelling, and stellar performances from its star-studded cast, the result is a game experience that is a true masterpiece and one of the most essential titles of the year.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "body": "**Disco Elysium: The Final Cut** is a unique and extraordinary RPG experience that defies many conventions. It delivers an intensely narrative-driven game where dialogue and player choice replace traditional combat mechanics, making it one of the most memorable role-playing games in recent years.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🗣️ Exceptional writing with witty, profound, and often legitimately hilarious dialogue  \r\n- 🧠 Deep character systems including talking skills and Thought Cabinet mechanics  \r\n- 🎭 Rich, immersive world with distinct characters and complex social dynamics  \r\n- 🎨 Distinctive art style that perfectly complements the tone and setting  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 📚 Heavy reliance on text and dialogue may overwhelm players not used to extensive reading  \r\n- 🕹️ Gameplay lacks traditional combat and can feel static to some players  \r\n- 🚪 The game’s ending kind of falls flat\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-08-05-disco-elysium-5.avif\r\n    alt=\"Disco Elysium\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nDisco Elysium puts you in the shoes of a broken, amnesiac detective tasked with solving a murder in the decaying city of Revachol. The game abandons traditional or even any form of combat entirely, instead relying on skill checks and branching dialogue trees that affect both the story and the protagonist’s fractured psyche. The unique mechanic where your skills argue with you adds a rich layer of personality and unpredictability. It's a literal traditional RPG in a sense,  while also being a novel, packaged in video game form.\r\n</div>\r\nThe game immerses you in a rich world filled with an expansive history and lore, unique characters, dark humor, and philosophical musings. The writing is exceptional, witty, profound, and often hilariously absurd—balancing bleak social commentary with moments of genuine human connection. Every conversation feels meaningful, with countless branching dialogue options shaped by your detective’s personality traits and internal conflicts.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-08-05-disco-elysium-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Disco Elysium\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\nWhat I loved the most about the writing was the dark humor, It’s the rare game that can make you laugh out loud while pondering existential themes, and this game does just that regularly. It's been quite a while since I literally laughed out loud so many times playing a single game. \r\n\r\nGameplay centers around skill checks governed by a complex web of 24 distinct character skills, ranging from physical prowess to emotional insight and perception. These skills often \"talk\" to you, creating an internal dialogue that influences your decisions and perspective, making each playthrough feel uniquely personal. Although it does feel quite confusing at first. What does this and what does that, as the names of the character skills aren't as straightforward as typical RPG games where you have Strength, Ailty, Intelligence, etc. Here in Disco Elysium, you have Visual Calculus, Encyclopedia, Savoir Faire, Electrochemistry, etc.\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\nGraphically, the game adopts a painterly style that feels both surreal and grounded. The city of Revachol feels alive and broken, with hand-painted environments that echo the narrative’s themes of decay and despair. This visual aesthetic enhances the game's moody atmosphere and complements its themes of decay and political unrest. It looks particularly good and I would say timeless.\r\n\r\nExploration is rewarding; the world is filled with hidden lore, side quests, and interactive objects that deepen the story and encourage curiosity.  It's a point-and-click game for keyboard and mouse players, but the game adopts a different control scheme for controller users by letting you control character movement directly. However, the experience is quite clunky, especially the pathfinding when interacting with the environment and characters. Its point-and-click nature still shows.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-08-05-disco-elysium-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Disco Elysium\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nThe narrative of Disco Elysium is a rich, layered exploration of identity, memory, and morality set against the backdrop of a decaying post-industrial city in a fictional world or universe sprinkled with bits of both science and fantasy. As a deeply flawed detective grappling with amnesia and personal demons, you unravel a complex murder mystery that combines political intrigue, social commentary, and existential profound questions. The story is told through very dense, evocative dialogue and player-driven choices that shape your character’s personality and the world around you, creating a uniquely immersive and emotionally resonant experience that challenges players to confront both external and internal conflicts. \r\n </div>\r\n\r\nDue  to the sheer volume of text and dialogue even in the most simplest forms of action in the game, the narrative can be overwhelming , which might not appeal to players who prefer faster-paced gameplay. This is even more evident in the original release which was only sparsely voice-acted, requiring players to read most dialogue. However, the 'Final Cut' now features a complete voice-over.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot itself is a conventional murder mystery and not especially unique, the game's true brilliance lies in its execution. The minute-to-minute delivery of the characters' thoughts and dialogue elevates the simple premise into something profound and substantial. This momentum carries through until the ending, which unfortunately falls flat in my opinion (the last five minutes). Nevertheless, it remains a uniquely great experience overall.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-08-05-disco-elysium-5.avif\r\n    alt=\"Disco Elysium\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n**Disco Elysium** is a landmark RPG that challenges traditional notions of gameplay and storytelling. Its masterful writing, innovative mechanics, and distinctive art style create an unforgettable experience that will be forever etched in your memory, even as its protagonist struggles to recall his own. While its very heavy text/dialogue focus may not suit everyone, it remains a must-play for fans of narrative-rich, thought-provoking games (or novels).\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "body": "How is it possible that a short game like **Dispatch** is this jam-packed with absolutely cool, hilarious, and outright epic moments? A lot of “short” narrative games feel like extended demos or proof-of-concept experiments. **Dispatch** feels like a short but fully realized eight-episode season that just happens to be interactive.\r\n\r\n🎬 Pros\r\n\r\n* Relentless pacing from Episode 1–8 with zero filler.\r\n* Legit funny writing where the jokes actually land.\r\n* Stellar cast of YouTubers, streamers, and actors that absolutely sell every scene.\r\n* Great character arcs that flip clichés on their head, or not. It’s unpredictable.\r\n* Engaging choices and “dispatch” gameplay that keep you involved moment to moment.\r\n\r\n💔 Cons\r\n\r\n* The overall 'big-picture' story stays mostly the same no matter what you pick, some choices feel more like flavor than full-on branching paths.\r\n\r\n## **A Short Game That Hits Way Too Hard**\r\n\r\nFrom Episode 1 all the way to Episode 8,  Dispatch just does not miss. The jokes land. The timing is sharp. The action is so fun to watch that you genuinely forget you’re \"playing a game\" and not just binging a wild TV series. Then it reminds you that yes, you actually have some control here (sometimes even forgetting that I need to pick up the controller) - all just enough for your decisions and the “Dispatch” side of things to matter without bogging you down in complicated gameplay mechanics. **Dispatch** hits that sweet spot where gameplay and narrative don’t compete; they feed into each other. Instead of taking you out of the narrative when the gameplay happens and vice versa.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, **Dispatch** is barely a video game in a traditional sense, It often feels more like a highly interactive TV series that borders on being a game. Yet, if its stellar execution earned it a Game of the Year nomination, I wouldn't complain, because it delivers a great gaming experience nonetheless.\r\n\r\n## **The \"Dispatch\" in Dispatch**\r\n\r\nEvery episode, there is a segment wherein you will perform your job as a ‘Dispatcher’. You act as the handler for your squad of misfit superheroes, fielding emergency calls and deciding which hero to deploy based on their specific stats - Combat, Vigor, Intellect, Charisma, and Mobility. it’s about logic and consequences. If you send a hero with max Combat but zero Charisma to a delicate hostage negotiation, they might \"solve\" the problem by punching everyone, causing massive collateral damage. \r\n\r\nYou have to juggle cooldowns as heroes get tied up on missions, forcing you to rely on your other heroes even if there is a mismatch on the stats, when things get hairy. It’s a perfect layer of strategy that makes you feel responsible for the chaos on screen without bogging down the story in spreadsheets.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay loop is surprisingly engaging for what could have been a simple menu screen. After your shift ends, the story continues via cutscenes with the player choosing different dialogue options to progress, the game seamlessly transitions from management sim to an interactive drama.\r\n\r\nThere is also a hacking mini-game for you to personally help the heroes in some instances, that serves as a nice palate cleanser, breaking up the menu-management loop just enough to keep things from feeling repetitive.\r\n\r\n## **A Cast That Shouldn’t Work, But Totally Does**\r\n\r\nOne of Dispatch’s biggest strengths is its cast. On paper, it sounds chaotic: a mix of YouTubers, content creators, and traditional actors all thrown together. In practice, that blend gives the game a weirdly authentic energy. It feels like people you might actually follow online got dropped into a high-stakes narrative.\r\n\r\nSeeing heavy hitters like Aaron Paul (*Breaking Bad*) and Jeffrey Wright (*The Batman*) trade lines with internet icons like MoistCr1TiKaL and Jacksepticeye creates a surreal but perfect dynamic. The unique mix pays off instantly. \r\n\r\nThe performances work because the writing backs them up. Characters are well written and surprisingly relatable, each with their own flaws and quirks. Even with the game’s short runtime, it does a great job of making you feel attached to this weird little team. You only spend a handful of episodes with them, but it’s enough to care.\r\n\r\nThe character development is also surprisingly well done. Some characters start off feeling insufferable or painfully cliché, the kind you think you’ve seen a thousand times before. Then the game slowly peels back layers, and suddenly they’re not so one-note. In several cases, Dispatch sets you up to think, “Oh, this guy is *obviously* going to do X,” and then it completely flips the script. Sometimes you’d think they’d flip the script, but to only end up not doing it. That subversion of expectations keeps the story fresh even when you’re sure you’ve figured it out. It’s not that predictable.\r\n\r\n## **Choices That Matter… Just Not How You Think**\r\n\r\nDispatch does involve choice, but not in the “every decision creates a new universe” kind of way. If you go in expecting a sprawling tree of wildly different endings and outcomes, that’s not what this is.\r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, the overall story path is still quite similar no matter what you do. Core events will still happen. Certain beats are locked in. You are not rewriting the entire narrative from scratch.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn’t mean your decisions are meaningless. Far from it.\r\n\r\n* Many dialogue choices change the immediate tone and content of conversations.\r\n* Bigger “action choices” can trigger more significant, sometimes gameplay-altering outcomes.\r\n* Some major decisions can unlock unique footage or swap a character or two in certain story beats.\r\n\r\nSo while the skeleton of the story stays the same, the meat on the bones changes depending on how you play. And honestly, that approach fits the game’s structure. Not every game needs a hundred endings and flowcharts that look like conspiracy boards. Dispatch focuses on telling one strong story with some meaningful variations, and that’s a valid design choice that pays off with the quality it was delivered in.\r\n\r\nI have just one big personal gripe: the best female hero (in my opinion) on the team is not romanceable, and it stings.\r\n\r\nWhen a game does such a good job making you care about its cast, it’s natural to want more ways to connect with them. Dispatch clearly knows how to write charming, layered characters, so when your favorite female hero ends up being completely off-limits romantically, it feels like a missed opportunity.\r\n\r\nEven without a second playthrough yet, Dispatch has that rare quality where you finish it and immediately think, “Okay, but what if I’d done that other thing instead?” The plan for another run is already brewing, not because the ending felt incomplete, but because it feels like there are more angles worth seeing, not a totally different story, just the different reactions, different combinations of scenes, maybe a few new surprises.\r\n\r\n## **Conclusion**\r\n\r\nFor a short, episode-based game, Dispatch manages to feel surprisingly full. The pacing is tight, the writing is sharp, the performances are on point, and the choices, while not universe-shattering, still feel impactful enough in the moment. It’s the kind of game that respects your time but still gives you plenty to chew on.\r\n\r\nIf you want something that plays like an interactive TV season - with great jokes, strong characters, and just enough agency to make you sweat your choices - Dispatch is absolutely binge-worthy your time. I only clocked in at about 8 or so hours for a single playthrough, so its quite playable in a couple of sittings if not one.",

    "body": "**Doom: Dark Ages** delivers a fast-paced, satisfying shooter experience that captures the spirit of the franchise while streamlining some gameplay elements. It’s the Doom game I enjoyed the most among recent titles, striking a balance between classic intensity and modern design.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- ⚡ Ultra-fast loading times that keep gameplay flowing  \r\n- 🔥 Smooth and polished combat flow reminiscent of classic Doom  \r\n- 🛡️ Strong enemy and level design with tight, compact encounters  \r\n- 🎯 Streamlined weapon management that keeps focus on action  \r\n- 💥 Gore and enemy variety that maintain the series’ brutal charm  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🎨 Graphics are simplified, with some textures feeling low-quality  \r\n- 😐 Human character models and faces look cartoonish, breaking immersion  \r\n- 🕹️ Lack of advanced platforming reduces vertical gameplay complexity  \r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-31-doom-dark-ages-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Doom: Dark Ages\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n\r\n**Doom: Dark Ages** is a return to the franchise’s classic roots but with a medieval twist, delivering fast-paced, brutal shooter gameplay with a focus on smooth flow and intense combat encounters. It strips away much of the complexity found in recent Doom titles, favoring streamlined mechanics that emphasize player skill and raw action.\r\n</div>\r\nFrom the outset, the game wastes no time throwing players into relentless battles against hordes of demons. as you’re greeted with combat that feels fluid and exhilarating. The flow of switching between weapons and engaging enemies is smoother than in Doom Eternal, with less fuss and more immediacy. No more switching to the chainsaw just because you needed more ammo, or having to use the flamethrower to get more armor, or having to use widely different weapon types because enemies have hard weakness or defense to specific types. Here in Dark Ages, the combat feels fast but approachable, without the complexity and weapon juggling that some players find tedious. All weapons are effective against all enemies, with only minor differences in efficiency. Ultimately, it all boils down to how you want to have fun,\r\n\r\nLevel design is tight and semi-open, offering enough exploration without feeling bloated or directionless. The encounters balance large enemy hordes with strategic opportunities to utilize different combat styles and weapon stances. While maps are compact and focused, they’re packed with secrets, alternate paths, and hidden caches that reward thorough exploration that doesn't feel tedious or a chore to do. It just came naturally for me to explore these extra areas.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-31-doom-dark-ages-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Doom: Dark Ages\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nOne of the game’s strongest features is its ultra-fast loading times, which maintain gameplay momentum and reduce downtime. and It always amazes me to click continue only to be in-game in 1-2 seconds, and I'm playing mostly on PC so it didn't have any advantages of any console SSD optimization. This applies to checkpoints, moving over to the next level, or loading a game. This, combined with polished combat animations and visceral gore effects, creates a short but satisfying loop that keeps you engaged from start to finish.\r\n</div>\r\nThe enemy variety is classic Doom, with familiar demons returning alongside some new threats. Each enemy type requires different tactics, but as I've said, are all within killable means with every weapon. and The game's roster of weapons is interesting and fun to use, and I found myself switching between them by choice, not because the game forced me to for a mechanical advantage. The game's pivot to a medieval theme is one of its greatest strengths. Far from being a negative, it serves as a refreshing departure from the series' traditional sci-fi backdrop, while still cleverly integrating the futuristic elements fans expect. And it's not like they shifted to Medieval out of nowhere, as they already have shown some medieval elements in the previous two games anyway.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-31-doom-dark-ages-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Doom: Dark Ages\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nThe game keeps encounters fresh by mixing enemy compositions and terrain challenges, especially by also including segments or levels where you instead mount a cybernetic dragon in third person mode, engaging in high-speed aerial combat. The controls are straightforward: holding the fire button unleashes a continuous barrage of attacks, while a dedicated dodge button allows for swift evasions. Players also have the opportunity to pilot the Atlan mech, a towering war machine equipped with formidable weaponry, emphasizing the mech's massive scale and destructive power. Despite the initial excitement, I found both of these segments to be a bit basic and lacking refinement, but it serves its purpose, which is to be a palette cleanser within the game itself and provide some additional variety.\r\n</div>\r\nWith regards to the platforming, in which I absolutely hated in Doom: Eternal, it is now toned down here and designed way better, they made the the experience feel more straightforward, accessible, and the movements are faster and easier, focusing on pure combat rather than navigation challenges. Overall, the game’s platforming is well tuned, offering challenges that reward mastery without becoming frustrating. \r\n\r\nGraphically, Doom: Dark Ages doesn't look much different but the previous two Doom titles, but it does consume significantly more resources because of the forced RT. Despite of that harsher but still reasonable requirements, some textures and character models still feels dated compared to modern shooters or even contemporaries in the same engine like Wolfenstein II or Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Although, this stylistic choice complements the fast gameplay and nostalgic vibe anyway. While the game maintains Doom’s trademark gore and demon designs, the human characters and faces fall short, giving off a cartoonish vibe that detracts from the otherwise gritty atmosphere. The sound design is punchy and atmospheric, with iconic weapon sounds and the usual heavy metal soundtrack that fuel the game’s intensity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-31-doom-dark-ages-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Doom: Dark Ages\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n**Doom: Dark Ages** stands out as a refined, fast-paced shooter that successfully blends classic Doom gameplay with modern sensibilities. Despite some graphical shortcomings, its combat flow, level design, and pacing deliver an engaging experience that fans of the series should not miss. Out of the three recent Doom games, I would say **Doom: Dark Ages** one is my absolute favorite.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

    "description": "Dragon Age: The Veilguard offers an action-oriented RPG experience with a rich story and character-driven quests, despite some controversy over art style and quest bloat.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "**Dragon Age: The Veilguard** has been at the center of intense discussion since its launch, with much of the controversy stemming from its art style and perceived emphasis on diversity. However, beneath the noise lies a substantial RPG experience that builds on the legacy of the franchise with bold gameplay and storytelling choices.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🎮 Action-oriented combat with God of War-style mechanics  \r\n- 📜 Strong quest structure with clear waypointing and side content  \r\n- 🌆 Clever level design balancing open-world exploration and linear progression  \r\n- 🎙️ Engaging storytelling with notable narration by Varric  \r\n- 🔄 Convenient fast travel system enhancing exploration flow  \r\n- 📜 A surprisingly satisfying ending that is the culmination of all the stories of the previous games\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🎭 Art style and character designs sparked divisive opinions  \r\n- 🗺️ Quest bloat with many filler quests that can feel repetitive  \r\n- 🐞 Some reused maps for multiple quests reducing variety  \r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-11-26-dragon-age-veilguard-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon Age: The Veilguard\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n\r\n**Dragon Age: The Veilguard** is a dark fantasy action RPG developed by BioWare that continues the legacy of the Dragon Age series by combining intense, now fully real-time combat with rich storytelling and expansive world-building. Set in a sprawling, immersive high fantasy world filled with political intrigue, ancient magic, and complex characters, It again invites players to step into the role of a customizable protagonist navigating a fractured land on the brink of war. As a long-time fan, I was too invested in the Dragon Age lore to simply stop playing. This is the fourth entry, the one that’s supposed to tie up all the story threads the series has been building for 15 years, so I just had to play it.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Veilguard adopts a more action-oriented combat system reminiscent of games like God of War or even Bioware's own title: Mass Effect, a notable departure from the real-time pausable tactical angle of earlier Dragon Age titles. \r\n\r\nSure, I miss the Dragon Age: Origins style of tactical play, which is much closer to Baldur's Gate 3 than the current Witcher 3 or God of War-style combat. But then again, the signs that BioWare wanted a more action-packed, real-time game were there as far back as Dragon Age 2. They've just gone all-in now, and I don't mind the change. It's a familiar transition for long-time RPG fans, similar to the shift from Fallout 2 to Fallout 3 or the evolution of the Final Fantasy series.\r\n\r\nThe combat was a lot of fun—action-packed, intense, and truly real-time. However, over the course of a 50+ hour experience, it began to feel repetitive and lacking in options. Having only three skill slots is far too limiting, and the skill tree feels restrictive, lacking variety and impactful abilities. While respecs are free, the entire skill system should have offered more to experiment with.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-11-26-dragon-age-veilguard-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon Age: The Veilguard\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nOne gripe though, is that while there is still a party system, you cannot control other characters anymore and are now stuck to your chosen class. You cannot try other class except for when starting a new savefile and creating a different class. This is very different from the previous games where you could 'sample' other classes by way of playing the characters. For example, in Origins, even though I was playing a Warrior, I could experience what it was like to be a Mage through Morrigan and Wynne. This added a layer of RPG depth in a single playthrough that is now missing.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe game primarily follows a more linear progression compared to previous entries, guiding players through a focused storyline packed with cinematic moments and meaningful choices. However, scattered throughout are pockets of semi-open areas ripe for exploration, where players can hunt for loot, uncover secrets, and complete side quests that deepen world-building and character development.\r\n\r\nThe quest structure, waypointing, and how objectives appear on the map were done very well. You can see other side quests on the map / minimap / compass even if you're not actively tracking them, which is a huge help for multitasking. The level design is probably the best in the series. The environments are a fantastic middle ground between open-world and linear, the locations are incredibly varied, and the smart use of verticality truly shines, especially now that they've finally added a jump button.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-11-26-dragon-age-veilguard-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon Age: The Veilguard\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nAs always, I have a problem with the sheer number of side quests in these games. This is especially true when quests for factions and companions appear to have a direct effect on the ending, creating a pressure to do everything. Games like this can feel bloated, filled with quests that just involve talking to a character or \"investigating\" by pressing a button on obvious glowing spots. The game also suffers from Dragon Age 2's habit of reusing the same maps for multiple quests. If you're a completionist who wants to do everything, you will see the same areas many, many times. Fortunately, Fast travel is implemented thoughtfully, allowing for quick movement without detracting from exploration. This convenience helps manage the sprawling map, making it easier to traverse between distant quest hubs and points of interest. On a minor note, I loved breaking all the destructible crates and vases!\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe art style change was a bit jarring at first. The cartoonish character proportions and faces felt strange, but the effect wasn't as substantial as I expected. The change was likely amplified by the new setting—the culture and architecture in Tevinter are naturally different. I noticed this when I got to the Deep Roads, a location from the first game. Things suddenly started to look familiar, and it proved the style hadn't changed that much after all.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-11-26-dragon-age-veilguard-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon Age: The Veilguard\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nDespite the decent visuals and best-in-class hair technology and regarding the controversies surrounding it, I found the characters weren't particularly attractive. As a straight male character, none of the romance options appealed to me, and they all felt better as friends. Some were initially annoying (especially their faces), like Neve with her stupid hat or Taash, but they grew on me. Speaking of Taash, I was wary because of the online backlash, but story-wise, she was an okay character. As for the game's DEI elements as a whole, I found them to be minimal; it took over 30 hours before I even encountered the first mention of a \"they/them\" pronoun, and it felt like a natural part of a character's personality, not something forced. It's not something that feels forced. It's basically in the same realm as Baldur's Gate 3's pronouns and man-bear romance or Mass Effect's alien and same-sex romances, when it comes to diversity.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nWhere the game takes a massive step back, in my opinion, is the roleplaying. The dialogue system has been heavily toned down, a trend that has continued with each game. There are no more skill checks in conversations, very few alternate outcomes, and no \"evil\" or \"asshole\" choices like in Origins or the Mass Effect games. This is something I hope BioWare improves in the future.\r\n\r\nThe main quest, however, is where the game truly excels. The core story and the major plotlines involving factions and characters (when they aren't filler) are incredibly well-made and will compel you to keep playing. I had goosebumps and hyped moments constantly, especially during the epic boss fights. This was no doubt amplified by my 15-year investment in the series. As for the resolution to the whole saga? I am very satisfied with how the story unfolded. It was an epic experience. The main companion quests were also interesting and larger-than-life, so much so that it often felt like I was playing multiple main quests simultaneously. In fact, if you were that invested in the series starting from the first one up to Dragon Age: Inquisition, playing this one up to the very end is worth it, and the ending absolutely pays off. They pulled off a surprisingly satisfying ending in this one, guys.\r\n\r\nWhile Veilguard does stumble on some fronts — including the art style controversy and quest repetition — it still delivers a compelling, immersive RPG experience with enough depth and charm to satisfy fans.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-11-26-dragon-age-veilguard-5.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon Age: The Veilguard\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nDespite its controversies and some design missteps, **Dragon Age: Veilguard** delivers a robust and engaging RPG experience. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my experience. Narratively, The Veilguard was an awesome and satisfying conclusion that stood on the shoulders of three excellent games. Gameplay-wise, it was fun enough to carry me through, but its lack of depth and variety kept it from being truly great.\r\n</div></div>",

    "title": "Severe Optimization Issues On An Otherwise A Promising Title | Dragon's Dogma II Review",
    "description": "Dragon's Dogma II is a highly anticipated sequel with unique party and combat mechanics but suffers from severe optimization issues, rushed story pacing, and technical drawbacks.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "## A personal favorite finally gets a long awaited sequel\r\nThe first Dragon's Dogma was one of my all-time favorite RPGs, especially for its engaging combat and unique mechanics. So when the second game was announced, I was beyond excited, pre-ordering it without hesitation - a very rare move for me. But unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment due to VERY severe optimization issues that made it nearly unplayable. Even after upgrading my aging CPU, FPS drops and frame spikes persisted, forcing me to set the game aside about halfway through the story. The game was shelved for MONTHS. I tried multiple times to return, even resorting to mods like Frame Gen to improve performance, but the mod was crashing until recently, when I finally managed to get a somewhat steady 100+ FPS with minor drops, allowing a smoother experience overall without crashing. So now, here comes the game.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique mechanics including the pawn system, allowing creation of a secondary character called a pawn  \r\n- Ability to recruit pawns from other players, offering a form of asynchronous multiplayer  \r\n- Lively companion chatter with dialogue for every occasion, making companions feel alive  \r\n- Satisfying combat featuring monster-climbing mechanics and visually striking animations  \r\n- Diverse combat skills spanning across 10 classes, each fun to play  \r\n- Quest setup encourages player independence and creative problem solving  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- Rushed plot with disjointed pacing, underdeveloped characters, and incoherent story arcs  \r\n- Major characters and locations felt underutilized and forgotten mid-story  \r\n- Performance issues with frame drops, clunky animations, and screen-door visual effects  \r\n- Poor shadowing and lighting quality highlight RE Engine limitations in open worlds  \r\n- Hardcore fast travel and checkpoint mechanics causing frustrating progress loss  \r\n- Heavy reliance on mods for improved performance and quality-of-life improvements  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/dragons-dogma-2-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon's Dogma II\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n## 🟩Pros: Mechanics, Party System, and Combat\r\nFirst, the positives: the many unique mechanics including the pawn system, here in this game you create your character in a traditional RPG fashion, create your 'secondary character' called a pawn, and recruit two more pawns which are secondary characters of other players that has travelled to your world.\r\n\r\nIn turn, your secondary character can be recruited by other players too in their own game sessions. Sort of an asymmetric type of multiplayer in the likes of Dark Souls, Death Stranding, etc. There is also the lively, even if repetitive, companion chatter: they respond to the world, have dialogues for every occasion and feel very much alive.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\nCombat is largely satisfying and is probably the best part of this game, with monster-climbing mechanics that add a lot of epicness into the equation, along with intense and visually striking animations and skills that span across 10 classes. Like in Dragon's Dogma 1, each class is fun to play, even magic and archery combat are done right and feels fun to play.\r\n\r\nThe quest setup, too, is refreshingly hands-off, giving players a sense of independence as they figure out solutions or navigate the map on their own terms. Whether it's handling an NPC or finding a new route, the game offers a lot of room for improvisation, which is a really great feeling that gives the players a sense of independence --- being able to think a solution for themselves. How you are given multiple possible paths to solve quests, coming up with a weird workaround to a quest and being genuinely surprised that its actually an option were nice aspects that carried over from the first game.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/dragons-dogma-2-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon's Dogma II\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n## 🟥Rushed Plot and Weak Character Development\r\nHowever, there are some major downsides. First is the story. While echoing the first game’s themes of cycles, prophecy, and destiny, it didn’t hook me in as strongly. The first half of the narrative felt too fast paced and feels disjointed. It just threw characters and plot points in and out of the story left and right. Characters that felt bigger initially were suddenly forgotten and there were some would-be big characters that actually didn't matter at all. It felt like a series wherein I was watching episode 2, stopped at the middle and then booted up episode 6, then started another arc, and then jumped to entirely another adaptation. It lacked proper explanation for many things and the plot just felt incoherent at times. As a side effect, the characters and locations in the game felt heavily underutilized.\r\n</div></div>\r\nThe plot eventually becomes more interesting towards last third of the narrative, but it never quite reaches that level of memorability or impact that I was expecting. At a surface level --- especially once you beat it -- the whole narrative gives the impression of being heartfelt, dramatic, profound, and deep, with a really fantastic soundtrack that will invoke these emotions. But the story never really felt that way to me. The game seemed rushed and unfinished, with some things missing that I can't quite put yet. This was also an issue with the first game, which I’d hoped would be addressed this time around by giving it the time and budget it deserved to avoid a similar fate. There were many signs that this game was building up to something bigger in terms of plot, characters, and locations but it never materialized. Be it due to lack of budget, time, or whatever, we will probably never know.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/dragons-dogma-2-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon's Dogma II\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n## 🟥Technical Drawbacks: Poor Performance and Visuals\r\nPerformance and visual quality also fell short. Despite using a frame generation mod, the game still felt clunky -- animations can be slow, floaty, and sometimes unresponsive. The visuals, even at high settings, are blurry with noticeable screen-door effects, TAA vaseline smeared over the visuals, and poor shadow/lighting quality across the board. This game clearly showcases the limitations of the RE Engine in open-world titles, which is very concerning for other upcoming games like Monster Hunter: Wilds that will use this engine. Oddly, the first game, despite the lower polygon and texture quality, still looks crisper and cleaner in comparison, especially if you add reshade / texture mods, not to mention it will run way better.\r\n</div></div>\r\nAlso the game is a little bit too hardcore when it comes to fast travel and navigation options, even for places that you’ve already visited. Especially when this game involves a lot of back and forth-ing between cities/settlements. At some point of the game, I’ve also found 'checkpoints upon dying' a bit too hardcore. I've lost hours of progress in this game, as an intended part of the game’s mechanics (you’ll know it when you experience it).\r\n\r\nI ended up relying on various mods to ease the experience: one for fast travel, another for balancing the store and armor systems (a huge step down from the first game which I didn't even talk about), and several quality-of-life improvements. But even then I still lost hours of progress due to the mentioned game mechanic above. The aforementioned frame generation mod was also essential. In fact I would say REQUIRED instead of just being a nice bonus performance like in other games.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/dragons-dogma-2-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Dragon's Dogma II\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nDon’t get me wrong - I did enjoy parts of my experience with it. However, much of that enjoyment came from using mods, looking up more of the lore online after I'm done with the game, my fond memories of the first game carrying over, and lastly, a bit of buyer’s remorse/bias for paying full price - making the game better than its deserved in my eyes.\r\n\r\nIn its current state, I can’t, in good conscience, recommend it especially at full price. If you're interested in this title, you might want to wait for a significant discount of 50% or even more. Or maybe wait for a better, more polished, 'Edition' with more content, down the line.\r\n</div></div>",

    "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth continues the saga with a more open world, refined combat, and a story leaning heavily on nostalgia and fan service, delivering a solid experience for longtime fans.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "**Final Fantasy VII Rebirth** takes the story in its own unique direction, moving beyond simply retelling the original. It leans heavily into fan service and nostalgia, clearly targeting longtime fans of Final Fantasy VII while also catering to newcomers. For newcomers who’ve only played the Remake, you’re not missing much story-wise, as the trilogy remains largely standalone.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- Unique story direction that doesn’t simply retread the original  \r\n- Improved combat with smoother animations and better responsiveness  \r\n- Vast open world maps with adventurous tone eclipsing the original remake  \r\n- Numerous engaging minigames adding variety  \r\n- Strong nostalgia and fan service for longtime FF7 fans  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- Combat still divided in identity; can feel stiff or confusing at times  \r\n- Performance issues on console with blurry visuals and inconsistent frame rates  \r\n- Party system limits you to three fighters at once despite larger roaming group  \r\n- Stealth sections feel minor and somewhat annoying  \r\n- Visual downgrade in sharpness compared to FF7 Remake on PS5  \r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/ff7-rebirth-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nThe narrative explores a lot of new territory, I would even go as far as to say it is going off the rails compared to the original Final Fantasy VII, ramping up the stakes and expanding the lore beyond what the first Remake covered. It dives deeper into Cloud’s past, his ties with Shinra, and his complicated relationship with Sephiroth, alongside new and returning characters. The story is far more engaging and paced better than the Remake’s initial glorified tutorial section. In fact, it got me hooked from the get go, as opposed to Final Fantasy VII being a slogfest in the first few hours.\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\nAs for the pivotal moments in the original game, Rebirth takes a cautious and somewhat restrained approach but at the same time, the game diverges from the original by exploring these events through new narrative perspectives and thematic mind bending layers, aiming to give players a fresh experience while respecting the significance of these moments. While some fans might find these portrayals less dramatic or way off from their expectations, it fits well within the game’s more modern tone, adding depth and nuance to a well-known story beat without overshadowing the broader narrative.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/ff7-rebirth-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Gameplay\r\nGameplay builds upon the Remake’s foundation but refines and improves many systems. The introduction of Synergy Abilities, which are powerful combo attacks (there are different sets of combinations by different characters available), fueled by the Active Time Battle gauge—adds fresh strategic depth to combat and one that encourages you to switch up the party composition more. The improved responsiveness and smoother animations make battles more gratifying, though the system’s hybrid nature between real-time and turn-based can still feel uneven at times.\r\n\r\nOne jarring aspect is the party system. While five characters roam the world together, only three participate in combat at any given time, creating a somewhat immersion-breaking disconnect. The game also includes minor stealth sections that are easy and brief but feel somewhat out of place.\r\n</div></div>\r\nThe combat feels improved overall. Animations are smoother, attacks hit with more impact, and responsiveness is significantly better. Yet, the system still struggles with its identity, caught between turn-based and real-time style without really wanting to abandon its turn-based roots fully. This can be jarring or confusing for some players. Stealth sections exist but are small and fairly easy — more of a minor annoyance than a core gameplay feature. Resource gathering and crafting replace the more straightforward “breakable objects” mechanic from the Remake, requiring players to collect materials and ingredients throughout the world. Though this extra step adds engagement and complexity, but it also demands more micromanagement, but its quite managable.\r\n\r\nThe world design in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth marks a significant expansion from the more confined urban spaces of the Remake, embracing a semi-open world structure that encourages exploration and discovery of Midgar. The maps are vast and varied, featuring diverse environments that range from dense forests and sprawling settlements to rugged mountains and ancient ruins. \r\n\r\nNumerous mini-games provide welcome variety although it can get quite tedious if you're a completionist. Overall, the expanded open-world invites thorough exploration with a wealth of side quests and hidden secrets. The campaign offers around 40 hours of content, with over 100 hours available for completionists, making Rebirth a substantial midway point in the Remake saga.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/ff7-rebirth-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Graphics and Sound\r\nGraphically, the game feels like a continuation of the Remake’s visual style. Although some aspects felt like a downgrade, especially in color vibrancy and fidelity (resolution). However, the open-world design eclipses the linearity of the first Remake, offering massive maps that encourage exploration and adventure, which kind of more than makes up for it. However, Performance on PS5 is mixed; the game can be blurry and struggles to maintain a stable 60fps, particularly during exploration. Combat sequences fare better but use aggressive dynamic resolution scaling.\r\n</div></div>\r\nThe soundtrack of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth masterfully blends orchestral grandeur with nostalgic motifs that pay homage to the original game's soundtrack while forging its own identity as well. Composed with a rich, cinematic quality, the music heightens the emotional impact of key story moments and enhances the atmosphere of each unique environment. In fact, many pivotal beats in the narrative are powerfully carried by the soundtrack, which offers a mix of familiar nostalgia and evocative melodies that deeply move and engage the player’s emotions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/ff7-rebirth-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n     <div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is a nostalgic yet fresh continuation of the Remake saga. It shines with an expanded open world, improved combat, and a story that honors longtime fans while exploring new narrative paths. Performance hiccups and some design quirks prevent it from reaching its full potential, especially for console users, but it remains an engaging experience well worth playing especially if you're a long time Final Fantasy fan.\r\n</div></div>",

    "tags": "",
    "body": "**Final Fantasy XVI** delivers a dark, complex story far removed from nostalgia, with strong cinematic action, a dynamic combat system that grows over time, and impressive medieval-themed visuals.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- Intriguing and deeply complex story with mature themes  \r\n- Strong motivation to keep playing beyond nostalgia  \r\n- Impressive and fitting medieval-inspired art style  \r\n- Over-the-top cinematic cutscenes and action sequences  \r\n- Dynamic combat system that evolves with new moves and skills  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- Performance on PS5 is unstable with notable FPS drops  \r\n- Party system feels underdeveloped and barebones, In fact there's no party at all. \r\n- Some combat combos feel repetitive despite variety in skills  \r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/ff16-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nI just played and beat **Final Fantasy XVI** a few weeks ago and strongly agree with my earlier thoughts: as far as storytelling goes, it’s a masterpiece. It’s a far cry from the campy and super cheesy counterpart that is FF7 Rebirth — which I also played and loved, mostly for nostalgic reasons. FFXVI offers mature themes and a depressing yet hopeful tone that hits deeper emotionally.\r\n\r\nThe story of Final Fantasy XVI marks a significant tonal shift for the series, weaving a dark, mature, and politically charged epic that draws more inspiration from medieval history and dark fantasy like Game of Thrones than from its own colorful predecessors. Set in the land of Valisthea, a world blessed by the light of colossal Mothercrystals, the narrative unfolds against a backdrop of encroaching doom. A mysterious Blight is slowly consuming the land, and the nations of Valisthea are locked in wars over the fading crystal resources. \r\n</div></div>\r\nThe medieval tone is definitely an acquired taste, and I understand many longtime FF fans might be put off by this, despite Final Fantasy being Medieval originally. After so many futuristic and sci-fi fantasy themes in recent games — including Final Fantasy 7 — going back to medieval times was a polarizing move. But for me, the story in FF16 felt longer, grander, and more epic than the others. Despite having roughly the same tracked playtime, the game felt more epic and grandier. The characters are memorable, and with more exposure through sales and releases on more platforms, I think it could actually become a cult classic.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I feel people kind of forgot about this game, but it turned out way better than I expected. I liked it more than FF7 Rebirth, which leans heavily on nostalgia and fan service.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/ff16-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Gameplay\r\n**Final Fantasy XVI**’s gameplay is a bold evolution of the series’ combat formula, shifting toward a fast-paced, action-oriented hack-and-slash style that emphasizes fluidity, precision, and spectacle. At its core, combat revolves around chaining together attacks, dodges, and special abilities to create satisfying combos that feel impactful and visually impressive.\r\n\r\nCombat starts slow and repetitive. Early hours focus heavily on story, cutscenes, and tutorials, with little action or depth. The first four-plus hours can feel boring and might discourage some players looking for some action instead of story. However, once you unlock more movesets and skills, the combat opens up with more fluid and dynamic hack-and-slash sequences, complemented by over-the-top cinematic QTEs. It’s like watching a classic anime come to life, and FFXVI absolutely nails this part. That said, some combos remain repetitive despite the variety of skills available.\r\n</div></div>\r\nThe game is very much a solo character experience. The party system feels underdeveloped — almost non-existent — lacking the fleshed-out skills from different characters and classes, combat roles, and character swapping typical of classic Final Fantasy titles or any JRPG game for that matter.\r\n\r\nA key feature is the introduction of the powerful Eikon summons that are woven into the very fabric of the experience, serving as much more than simple summons. Narratively, each of these colossal beings is bound to a human Dominant, grounding their god-like power in personal tragedy and political conflict. This connection is brilliantly integrated into gameplay and story, as the protagonist, Clive, absorbs the abilities of the Eikons he defeats. This system creates a tangible link between story progression and player empowerment, as your combat arsenal directly reflects the dramatic journey you've undertaken and the powerful individuals you've encountered.\r\n\r\nThis synergy culminates in the game's spectacular Eikon-versus-Eikon battles. These are not just cinematic cutscenes or just QTE sequences but playable, awe-inspiring clashes of immense nuclear scale where you take direct control of a towering deity. Because each battle is the explosive climax of a deeply personal story arc, the impact is immense. This seamless fusion of narrative weight, character growth, and epic, hands-on spectacle is what makes the Eikons an unforgettable and foundational pillar of the entire game.\r\n\r\nOutside combat, there is quite a bit of exploration, as the classic Final Fantasy style overworld opens up slowly as you progress the story, unfolding through a series of semi-open areas teeming with secrets, collectibles, and engaging side quests. As said, the game features an overworld that connects these varied regions, allowing players to travel seamlessly between different semi-open zones. This design gives the world a truly expansive feel—large and grand in scale—without ever feeling overcrowded or cramped like in fully open world titles. The deliberate pacing and thoughtful level design create a sense of vastness and freedom, inviting players to immerse themselves in the world’s rich environments at the story's pace.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/ff16-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Graphics and Art Style\r\nVisually, Final Fantasy XVI has a different look compared to other games in the series, using a more muted and medieval style. . The world of Valisthea is rendered in a deliberately muted palette, favoring earthen tones, somber grays, and deep crimsons that evoke the grit and realism of Western medieval fantasy, which is probably an intentional choice to match the game's serious and mature narrative. This art style is meant to reflect the dark fantasy setting and the difficult themes present in the story.\r\n</div></div>\r\nThe game is technically well-made in the graphics department, with detailed character models and large, well-crafted environments that look like one big CGI FMV that you'd only sparingly see in the classic Final Fantasy titles. The world feels believable because of the variety in its locations and the quality of the graphics, helping to set the mood in different scenes and complementing the overall serious tone of the plot.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\nPerformance on the PlayStation 5 is inconsistent. The game targets 60fps, but frequent dips occur and never really maintains it, especially during open-world exploration. Combat sequences typically maintain smoother frame rates but rely on aggressive dynamic resolution scaling. I would highly recommend playing the PC version as it offers better performance and visuals in general, but it isn't the best as well in terms of technical optimization.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/ff16-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n**Final Fantasy XVI**  rekindles my love for Final Fantasy with its top-tier cinematics and intense narrative-driven action sequences that feel cinematic and anime-inspired. The narrative is emotionally impactful, with moments that truly resonate and stand out as some of the best storytelling in the series. While the party system feels underdeveloped and the combat is now real-time, the sum of its parts including the gameplay and story more than make up for it, delivering a compelling single-player experience. The game’s mature themes and absence of campy elements are a welcome change.\r\n</div></div>",

    "description": "Ghost of Tsushima offers an immersive samurai tale with beautiful open world, satisfying combat, and meaningful progression.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "After primarily gaming on PC for most of the past decade, I finally returned to consoles with a PS5 and Xbox Series X. One of the first games I tackled was **Ghost of Tsushima** — a title I’d missed during the PS4 era but heard so much praise about.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- ⚔️ Deep, varied combat styles and stances that keep fights fresh  \r\n- 🌄 Beautiful, handcrafted open world with immersive atmosphere  \r\n- 🧩 Meaningful side activities that reward exploration  \r\n- 🚀 Insanely fast ~3 second fast-travel loading times on PS5  \r\n- 🎭 Storytelling with strong narrative quality and emotional depth  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🐴 No auto-pathing or cinematic horse travel like in RDR2 or recent AC games  \r\n- ⏳ Story pacing is a bit slow at times, unskippable dialogue\r\n- 🤦‍♂️ Some story moments feel unresolved or frustrating (e.g. Ishikawa and Tomoe arc)  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-01-01-ghost-of-tsushima-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Ghost of Tsushima\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n    <div>\r\n\r\nAt its heart, Ghost of Tsushima tells an awesome, classic samurai story.  The narrative follows Jin Sakai, a samurai struggling to defend his home from the Mongol invasion. The story's pacing can feel a little slow at times, especially with the unskippable dialogue, but the quality of the narrative, the commitment to its themes, and the strength of its characters carried me through effortlessly. In fact, it's one of the only games where the inability to skip cutscenes and dialogue wasn't a problem for me; I was completely invested in the world and its tale.\r\n\r\nThe game is set on the beautiful island of Tsushima. With protagonist Jin Sakai finds himself one of the last surviving members of his clan against an overwhelming Mongol army. He faces a profound moral and tactical dilemma: should he stick to the honorable samurai code of facing enemies head-on, or should he embrace the dishonorable but effective path of the \"Ghost\"—using stealth, fear, and unconventional tactics to save his people? This internal and external conflict forms the core of the game's powerful narrative.\r\n        </div> </div>\r\n\r\nWhile the main story is strong, it isn't without its flaws. The plot occasionally relies on tired narrative tropes to move forward, and the motivations of a central figure can feel frustratingly rigid, bound by a code that clashes with the story's more pragmatic themes. Furthermore, some significant side-character arcs build up fascinating moral complexity only to conclude abruptly and fall flat, leaving their compelling questions feeling unresolved. These are minor issues in an otherwise excellent narrative, but they are noticeable blemishes nonetheless.\r\n\r\nThe character progression is excellent. The game masterfully compels you to explore its beautiful world by tying side activities directly to meaningful character upgrades. Clearing out Mongol camps, following foxes to hidden shrines, composing haikus, and slicing bamboo all reward you with techniques and legend that make you tangibly more powerful. Unlocking new skills and armor always feels exciting and worthwhile. It never felt like a chore to me. Even when it might look like a Ubisoft/Assassin's Creed RPG title in terms of formula, there is a subtle quality difference and thats what make Ghost of Tsushima stands out.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-01-01-ghost-of-tsushima-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Ghost of Tsushima\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nThis feeds directly into the combat, which is simply amazing. The core of the swordplay revolves around different stances, each designed to be effective against specific enemy types (e.g., Stone Stance for swordsmen, Water Stance for shieldmen). Switching between them on the fly while parrying, dodging, and looking for an opening feels fluid and strategic. The animations are satisfyingly smooth and great, it never feels clunky or rough. The Standoff mechanic, where you challenge enemies to a one-hit-kill duel, never gets old, because its just like the films. As Jin embraces his \"Ghost\" persona, you also unlock a full suite of stealth tools and abilities, allowing you to play as an honorable samurai, a deadly ninja-like character, or a mix of both. So it's not really just a Samurai game, but a Ninja game too. While the combat is fantastic, there's still room for improvement, perhaps with more enemy variety or more complex boss mechanics in a potential sequel.\r\n</div>\r\nA key feature of the Director's Cut on PS5 (and eventually, PC) is the insane loading times. I remember talking with a friend about this game, and he casually mentioned reading the tips on the loading screens. I was perplexed because I had never seen anything like that, but I eventually found out that the Director's Cut loads in 1-2 seconds, which basically makes the loading screens obsolete. Fast traveling across the vast map takes a mere 2-3 seconds, a technical marvel that completely changes the pace of exploration. Still, I would have loved a cinematic auto-pathing mode for my horse during long journeys, similar to the feature in Red Dead Redemption 2, to better soak in the stunning scenery.\r\n\r\nVisually, the game is renowned for its breathtaking beauty. Colorful, vibrant scenery that showcases the romantic beauty of feudal Japan. At the same time, its art style is heavily inspired by classic samurai cinema, particularly the films of Akira Kurosawa, focusing on picturesque landscapes, vibrant color palettes, and dramatic weather. The game famously includes a \"Kurosawa Mode,\" which renders the entire world in a cinematic black-and-white with film grain and altered audio, perfectly mimicking the look and feel of those iconic movies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-01-01-ghost-of-tsushima-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Ghost of Tsushima\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n     <div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n**Ghost of Tsushima** is a masterclass in blending cinematic storytelling with open-world exploration and nuanced combat. It captures the spirit of samurai films with a heartfelt narrative and breathtaking environments. While not without flaws—such as slow pacing and unresolved story threads—it offers a deeply rewarding experience that few games in the genre can match. For fans of samurai stories and atmospheric adventure games, this title is an essential play. If the series continues, I’d be eager to see Jin embrace his “Ghost” persona fully and maybe even lead a ninja clan, expanding on the fascinating world the game has built.\r\n</div></div>",

    "body": "Ghost of Yotei, the newest installment in the acclaimed feudal Japan action series, shifts the stage to Ezo/Hokkaido Japan, introducing a new protagonist, Atsu, and a razor-sharp revenge narrative. Set during a tumultuous period, the game follows Atsu as she embraces the path of the Ghost to hunt down her targets. While built upon the foundations of its predecessors, Yotei immediately distinguishes itself by prioritizing refined gameplay flow and anti-fatigue design over overwhelming map density, setting it up as a truly modern open-world experience.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n* ⬆️Improves upon the first game in almost every aspect. \r\n* 🧠Open world that flows like a tightly crafted linear experience.\r\n* ⚔️ Combat system is more fun, powerful, and incredibly versatile.\r\n* 🔪 Assassination mechanics are superior, featuring chain assassinations and numerous gadgets.\r\n* 🗺️ Map and quest design are minimalistic and highly anti-fatigue.\r\n* ❤️ Side quest content maintains the quality and depth of the main narrative.\r\n* 📜 Pure, focused revenge story provides a strong, cinematic narrative core.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n* 💬 Still no option to skip dialogue line-by-line, necessitating full scene skips.\r\n* 🐌 Character development starts slowly before truly kicking in.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, ***Ghost of Yotei*** presents a unique paradox: it’s an open-world game that never feels like one, and I'm saying that as a compliment. If you’ve ever played a cinematic, tightly constructed experience like *The Last of Us Part II* or *Uncharted 4*, you’ll recognize that focused, deliberate pacing here. The game manages to achieve a similar sense of momentum, making you feel as though you are constantly being propelled forward by an invisible, masterfully crafted narrative thread.\r\n\r\nIn *Yotei*, nothing seems a chore. This is perhaps in my opinion the greatest compliment that can be paid to a modern open-world title. The experience flows from exploring caves into working out where the hot springs is, and even the weapon unlocks, abilities, and bounties are all tied together into a single, cohesive progression loop. How smoothly everything integrates means you’d think it was a tightly crafted linear experience, yet the entire world of mainland Japan is yours to explore. This highly gameplay-focused approach means the pacing is very well done, focusing on gameplay and progression almost immediately without any boring padding.\r\n\r\n## Anti-Fatigue Design\r\n\r\nA massive contributing factor to this smooth flow is the game’s philosophy on map design and user interface. For once, an open-world game avoids turning its map into a migraine-inducing cluster of meaningless icons. The map and quest design are brilliantly minimalistic and very anti-fatigue.\r\n\r\nThis minimalist presentation extends directly into the gameplay. The UI disappears when not needed, keeping the screen clean and allowing the gorgeous environment to take center stage. You are encouraged to follow environmental cues—the wind, the movement of animals, the texture of the ground—rather than staring at a compass or mini-map. This deliberate approach to pulling the player into the world, rather than pushing them toward objective markers or bombarding them with information, is what makes the questing and progression so rewarding. Everything feels earned, not checked off a list. \r\n\r\nIt also helps that there are multiple ways of finding where points of interests are, perhaps you'd prefer climbing a high spot, looking at your spyglass to spot these from afar. Perhaps you'd just want to buy a map from the cartographer and deduce where it is on the world map, or maybe you want to use your musical instrument Shamisen to let the wind guide you where you want to go, be it a Hot Springs to increase your health, a shrine to unlock new skills, a bamboo strike location to increase your spirit, and more.\r\n\r\nThis respect for player agency in discovery is echoed in the exceptional quality of the content itself. Side quests, 'Tales' quests, and even random encounters are not throwaway filler; instead, they are exceptional content that consistently rival the quality and depth of the main story. By treating every minor narrative with the same cinematic weight, *Ghost of Yotei* ensures that venturing off the beaten path is always a choice of intrigue, never a grind or a nuisance.\r\n\r\n## Powerful Combat and Traversal\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to engaging with the enemy, *Yotei* truly shines. The combat system feels superior to the previous *Ghost of Tsushima*, and it has arguably one of the bestcombat system in the genre right now. You feel the full weight and power of Atsu, the protagonist. She is a versatile engine of destruction, wielding a comprehensive arsenal that makes her feel like AC Shadow's Yasuke and Naoe rolled into one person with all the weapons she can use back and forth seamlessly. From the Katana (or even two of it dual wielded), Kusarigama, Yari, Odachi, Hankyu (Medium Bow), Yumi (Longbow), Tanegashima (Rifle) and multiple types of throwables such as Bombs and Kunais.\r\n\r\nBeyond the straight-up conventional weapons, the tools of the trade are elevated even for Stealth. *Ghost of* *Yotei* does assassinations way better, providing players with satisfying ways to clear out camps using chain assassinations, kunai and kusarigama assassinations, smoke bombs, and blind bombs. The sheer variety ensures that stealth doesn't become monotonous; you always have the right gadget for the job, even if it doesn't all go to plan.\r\n\r\nThis sense of fluid power also defines movement, which retains the grounded, focused style established in the series. While you cannot truly parkour onto every single surface on the map, the traversal is way better due to its smooth, intentional flow. The game avoids the open-world pitfall of excessive clutter, focusing instead on dedicated, well-placed open areas, climbing paths, and grappling points. This style ensures that when Atsu climbs a rooftop or scales a cliff, it feels deliberate and athletic, maintaining the cinematic weight of the action rather than devolving into mere free-climbing. This focused verticality makes exploration not just a means to an end, but an enjoyable part of the game loop.\r\n\r\n## Kill-Yotei-Six: A Revenge Story with Bite\r\n\r\nWhile many players enjoyed Jin Sakai’s personal 'Samurai or Ghost' struggles and the political drama of the previous entry, I love Yotei’s story more because it is a pure revenge story which 100% fits the ‘Ghost’ name. It is a no-nonsense revenge narrative, similar to *Kill Bill*—streamlined and highly focused. This approach creates a strong emotional hook right from the start of Atsu’s \"revenge tour.\"\r\n\r\nInitially, the characters felt underdeveloped as you are immediately thrown into the action, but they are slowly fleshed out through flashbacks and more dialogue as the game progresses. This patience pays off, creating connections that feel earned. I found the characters less insufferable than the companions of the previous game, and the main villain has more of a personal connection to Atsu than simply being a powerful conqueror. This narrative structure—where the tension builds with each step toward the final target—creates a more cinematic and personally engaging experience.\r\n\r\n## World Detail and Against Contemporaries\r\n\r\nThe move to mainland Japan (or rather, Hokkaido/Ezo) has allowed the developers to create a world that is visually spectacular, incredibly lively, and much more familiar looking and relatable. The graphics are crisper this now around, now built for the PS5. The environment feels interactive and grounded, particularly the foliage and grass effects, which are absolutely still best-in-class and unparalleled just like its predecessor. The overall visual design and artistry are exemplary. Furthermore, the cinematic weather system, especially the effect of rain, fog, and lightning, when it is fired up, adds a thick layer of cinematic atmosphere to every confrontation. The world, while vast, is designed for immersion and beauty. All of this is achieved while still being able to provide an option for 60fps gameplay without any noticeable blurriness in the resolution. The game is very well optimized compared to other modern titles.\r\n\r\nNow, we have to address the obvious comparison: *Assassin's Creed Shadows*. It released in a similar timeframe and shares a setting and theme. It is true that *Shadows* offered excellent weather systems, stealth and parkour systems, allowing players to climb nearly anything and explore a similarly lively world with detailed interiors. However, where *Yotei* pulls ahead is in its cohesion. While *Shadows* may have offered robust individual systems, *Ghost of Yotei* succeeds by merging combat, progression, world design, and narrative flow into a single, better made, anti-fatigue experience. The overall package of *Yotei*, when everything is summed together, simply never felt like a chore and proved to be the more satisfying open-world game.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\n*Ghost of Yotei* is a phenomenal achievement that without a doubt improves upon the first game in almost every aspect. It provides a blueprint for how open-world games can respect a player's time while still delivering scope and scale. The side quest content is absolutely on par with the quality of the main quest, sometimes perhaps even better, meaning there is always something worthwhile to do. While I found a small annoyance in the inability to skip dialogue per line, similar to the first game, but that is a minor quality-of-life request that barely diminishes the final product.\r\n\r\nWith its best-in-class combat, masterful art design, and flawless pacing, *Ghost of Yotei* is easily one of the best games of the year and is a mandatory purchase for any fan of the action-adventure genre with even the slightest appreciation for ancient Japanese culture.",

Not just as a list of critically acclaimed titles, but as personal experiences that stuck with me through late nights and memorable moments. These are the games that made me lose track of time, brought out the best in fun, or simply told a story that stayed with me long after the credits rolled.\r\n\r\nThis list isn’t based on technical benchmarks, public reception, awards, or internet hype. It's about what I actually played, completed, and personally enjoyed. It’s shaped by what got installed and stayed installed. What I kept thinking about. What I wanted to talk about. So, while some big hitters like *Astro Bot* or *Balatro* might be missing here, it’s not because they weren’t great, but simply because they weren’t part of my rotation. At least not yet!\r\n\r\nThese five games stood out not just for what they did well, but for how they made me feel—whether it was stress, awe, laughter, or that quiet satisfaction of finally clearing something tough. Some are cinematic and polished, others scrappy but surprising. All are worth your time.\r\n\r\nLet’s get into it.\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"/images/reviews/legacy/2024-07-26-one-of-the-most-naturally-cinematic-games-ive-played-in-recent-years--helldivers-2---late-2.avif\"\r\n    alt=\"Helldivers 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n  <div>\r\n\r\nThis is the only one game that has mostly kept me busy playing throughout sleepness nights and weekends, and you’re probably tired of hearing about it. **Helldivers 2**. A coop shooter with hardcore elements and action-packed cinematic gameplay.\r\n\r\nWhat is **Helldivers 2?** How is the Gameplay? From the onset, it looks like a typical coop shooter like Left 4 Dead 2, GTFO, Deep Rock Galactic, World War Z, which are all stellar games by the way, so you might think this game has nothing special to it. Hell, even Helldivers 1 is very very similar except top down.\r\n\r\nHowever, Helldivers 2 has hit the jackpot on several fronts. It has funny / epic themes, intense cinematic action, addicting progression and mechanics, and fun gameplay overall. There is no better feeling than dropping down with your friends, completing a very hard mission, getting overwhelmed by a mix of either bugs or robots, and making it to the extraction point by the skin of your teeth. It's probably the my most played game of the year, and perhaps, my personal Game Of The Year winner if I ever to award one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Read full review →](/article/2024-07-26-one-of-the-most-naturally-cinematic-games-ive-played-in-recent-years-helldivers-2-late/)\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"/images/reviews/2025-04-02-metaphor-refantazio-2.avif\"\r\n    alt=\"Metaphor: ReFantazio\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n  <div>\r\n\r\nAs soon as I started my playthrough of **Metaphor: ReFantazio**, it becomes clear that this is something different. From the creative minds behind the Persona series, this game leverages a familiar, stylish blueprint but applies it to a fascinating new world full of wonder, creating an experience that is both comfortably recognizable and refreshingly unique, in many aspects.\r\n\r\n**Metaphor: ReFantazio** is a masterful blend of the old and the new. It successfully transplants the beloved, stylish formula of the Persona series into a new high-fantasy world, all while innovating on the turn-based combat formula in truly new meaningful ways. While those looking for a deep life-sim might miss that aspect, the game’s compelling world, addictive combat, and incredible sense of style make it an absolute must-play for JRPG fans and a serious contender for Game of the Year.\r\n\r\nIt’s easily one of the standout games of the year.\r\n\r\n[Read full review →](/article/metaphor)\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"/images/reviews/2024-12-24-indiana-jones-great-circle-3.avif\"\r\n    alt=\"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n  <div>\r\n\r\n**Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** initially raised some skepticism for me because of its first-person perspective, I really thought I wont like it because of the first person view, because i played Uncharted and Tomb Raider and I wanted those kind of games. I thought I knew better.\r\n\r\nWell, the first person view absolutely works! Not only your in tune and more immersed as Indy, you also get upclose and personal with the puzzles and locations, which can now be much more cramped and smaller because of the view. It allows you to lean in and inspect ancient mechanisms, decipher cryptic markings up close, and feel a genuine sense of tension as you peer into a dark, unknown passage. The puzzles are a major highlight; they strike an excellent balance between being challenging enough to make you feel clever and intuitive enough to avoid unfair frustration. This isn’t just watching a hero solve a mystery; you are the hero, you are **Indiana Jones**, and the feeling of discovery is consistently rewarding.\r\n\r\n[Read full review →](/article/indianajonesgreatcircle)\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"/images/reviews/ff7-rebirth-3.avif\"\r\n    alt=\"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n  <div>\r\n\r\n**Final Fantasy VII Rebirth** takes the story in its own unique direction, moving beyond simply retelling the original. It leans heavily into fan service and nostalgia, clearly targeting longtime fans of Final Fantasy VII while also catering to newcomers. For newcomers who’ve only played the Remake, you’re not missing much story-wise, as the trilogy remains largely standalone.\r\n\r\nOverall, **Rebirth** a nostalgic yet fresh continuation of the Remake saga. It shines with an expanded open world, improved combat, and a story that honors longtime fans while exploring new narrative paths. It is an engaging experience well worth playing especially if you're a long time Final Fantasy fan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Read full review →](/article/finalfantasyviirebirth)\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"/images/reviews/2024-11-26-dragon-age-veilguard-2.avif\"\r\n    alt=\"Dragon Age: Veilguard\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n  />\r\n  <div>\r\n\r\n**Dragon Age: The Veilguard** is a dark fantasy action RPG developed by BioWare that continues the legacy of the Dragon Age series by combining intense, now fully real-time combat with rich storytelling and expansive world-building. Set in a sprawling, immersive high fantasy world filled with political intrigue, ancient magic, and complex characters, It again invites players to step into the role of a customizable protagonist navigating a fractured land on the brink of war. As a long-time fan, I was too invested in the Dragon Age lore to simply stop playing. This is the fourth entry, the one that’s supposed to tie up all the story threads the series has been building for 15 years, so I just had to play it.\r\n\r\nDespite its controversies and some design missteps, **Dragon Age: Veilguard** delivers a robust and engaging RPG experience. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my experience. Narratively, The Veilguard was an awesome and satisfying conclusion that stood on the shoulders of three excellent games. \r\n\r\n[Read full review →](/article/dragonageveilguard)\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAnd that wraps it up. Whether it was fighting overwhelming odds, killing aliens or robots in a squad of four, immersing myself in an underappreciate High-Fantasy RPG world, or discovering a whole new world of wonders, each of these titles made this year’s gaming journey feel memorable and worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of a personal GOTY list is that it reflects what stuck with you—not what trended. These were the games I enjoyed the most, the ones I brought up in conversations, and the ones that made me excited to hit “Continue” or \"Load Game\" after a long day.\r\n\r\nUntil then—clear your backlog, follow the fun, and play what makes you excited to pick up the controller again. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

    "description": "\"How do you follow up a game that redefined its genre and was",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "How do you follow up a game that redefined its genre and was universally praised as a modern masterpiece? In *Hades II*, Supergiant Games has answered that impossible question with a resounding success. The original *Hades* perfected the rogue-lite formula with kickass combat, endless procedural mechanics, and clever, character-driven storytelling. Yet, incredibly, *Hades II* has managed to top every single aspect of the first game and made them better. \r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n* 👑 The world and hub area feel larger, featuring two major, distinct procedural routes.\r\n* 🔮 More unique, sophisticated weapon design and the new omega attacks elevate the action.\r\n* ♾️ The Incantation and Gathering system as a progression system is very engaging, surprisingly anti-fatigue, and deeply rewarding.\r\n* 🎨 Art Style is absolutely gorgeous, featuring the studio's signature vibrant 2D character portraits and environments.\r\n* 🎭 Clever storytelling that is in sync with the looping rogue-lite gameplay.\r\n* 🔥 Managed to improve upon the near-perfect rogue-lite formula of the original, in terms of combat, progression, and story.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n* 🗡️Some players may miss the straightforward, archetypical weapons (sword, spear, bow, etc) of the first game.\r\n\r\nFor me, that anticipation was so immense that I painstakingly held off on playing the early access for a whole year, so my experience will be the same as the first game, where i played it after early access. The decision to wait was hard, everybody was playing it when it released on early access, but for me it was necessary: I didn't want to play it incomplete and risk burning out on the game even before its full release, ensuring I could experience the completed narrative for the first time.\r\n\r\nWhile you might still like some parts of *Hades I* due to personal preferences, because the first game is also a masterpiece, the sequel is a clear evolution in ambition, mechanical depth, and scale. You couldn’t go wrong with either game, but Melinoë’s journey feels like a true generational leap for the genre.\r\n\r\n## **The Fun Action-Packed Hack and Slash Combat**\r\n\r\nAt its core, the appeal of *Hades* has always been its fast, deep, engaging hack and slash action, and *Hades II* leans heavily into complexity. The runs are always engaging due to its procedural selection of “Boons” or selection of abilities that Gods will give you randomly per level, and the combat elevates them further. \r\n\r\nThe game also switches it up from its predecessor: the familiar quick dodges from the first game (that was admittedly fun with boons) is now replaced by Melinoë's continuous sprint, fundamentally changing how the player traverses arenas and avoids damage. At first I was not a fan of this move, but after playing a while, I acquired the taste for it and i found really matched with Melinoë's style of combat anyway.\r\n\r\nThe weapons this time around are definitely more unique and sophisticated. Gone are the classic, archetypical fantasy weapons like the sword, spear, shield, bow, etc. that defined the first game. Instead, Melinoë, the Princess of the Underworld and our new protagonist, wields specialized witch tools that encourage specific playstyles. While my first thought was, \"how can it top the *Hades 1* combat, especially when the main character of Hades 2 is a witch and more mage-type, not a warrior like Zagreus?\", the answer lies in the shift to calculated aggression and resource management.\r\n\r\nMelinoë herself has a dedicated resource meter (Magick/Mana) used for her powerful \"Omega\" moves, fundamentally separating her abilities from Zagreus's pure physical attacks. This can create a rhythm of spending, retreating, and recovering that is more engaging than simple physical aggression, depending on the build. The \"Omega\" attack, a powerful, resource-draining move that requires you to hold attack buttons, is unique to each weapon and introduces a crucial layer of tactical decision-making, transforming simple button-mashing into deep, calculated action with a much higher mechanical ceiling. This change immediately makes the combat feel fresh, also adding a resource management aspect alongside aggressive boons from the gods.\r\n\r\n## **The Anti-Fatigue Progression Loop**\r\n\r\nOne of the game's greatest triumphs is the progression system. It is very engaging and very easy to learn. In typical rogue-lite fashion, you accumulate a lot of different ingredients and materials, which might look intimidating at first. The genius of the design, however, is that you truly don't need to stress over it: just keep playing, no need to pay close attention, just keep playing and you’ll get it as you do more runs.\r\n\r\nThis seamless progression is thanks to the central hub, the Crossroads, which acts as the anti-grind engine. Materials gathered during failed runs are used to perform Incantations - permanent unlocks that dramatically change the flow of the game, such as unlocking new weapons and functionalities, forcing your favorite boon provider god to appear, or enabling new powers and bonuses through the Arcana Card Deck system. Every failed escape attempt feels valuable because it inevitably leads to a permanent upgrade, ensuring that your time is always rewarded. The system is entirely anti-fatigue and perfectly complements the addictive nature of the combat loop.\r\n\r\n## **Larger Scope, Beautiful Artistry, and Narrative Depth**\r\n\r\nThe maps and the world feel bigger than ever. The home base where Melinoë retreats after defeat - the aforementioned Crossroads - is significantly larger than the House of Hades, populated by a wonderful new cast including the witch Hecate and several new Olympic gods, all providing services and commentary.\r\n\r\nCrucially, the game features two big procedural areas to run on instead of just one. Melinoë's main task is to journey through the Underworld to face the Titan Chronos (Time), but an entirely separate, brutal route opens up later that I won’t spoil. This route acts as another distinct, high-difficulty challenge, doubling the effective content and vastly increasing replayability as you pursue two separate endgame goals.\r\n\r\nThis storytelling prowess is amplified by Supergiant's unique aesthetic. The art style is absolutely gorgeous, featuring the studio's signature hand-drawn 2D character portraits contrasted with vibrant, dynamic isometric environments.\r\n\r\nThe clever storytelling is the true secret weapon of the franchise. The game leans in hard on the narrative that is entirely time-gated to the gameplay loop, meaning failure is never a full stop, but rather a necessary narrative beat. Every time Melinoë dies, she returns to the Crossroads, where characters react specifically to the progress she made, the items she found, or the bosses she defeated in her last attempt. This continuous, reactive dialogue - of which there are thousands of lines - ensures that the story moves forward relentlessly, even when the player is struggling. If the player dies, struggles, wins, or anything really, the NPCs will comment on that.\r\n\r\nComplementing this ingenious structure is the top-tier voice acting. Every god, minor NPC, and ally is brought to life with emotional depth, perfect comedic timing, and wit. Despite having no animations, cutscenes, mocap, or facial capture. The voice performers elevate the witty, modern script, ensuring that every spoken line whether it's an encouraging word from a friend or a condescending insult from a deity, advances the plot, deepens a relationship, or simply provides a necessary laugh. The way the narrative is implemented into the cyclical/looping nature of the runs remains utterly brilliant. Dialogue shifts and deepens with every interaction, making the character development feel organic and personally earned.\r\n\r\n## **Conclusion**\r\n\r\n*Hades II* is a phenomenal game that, without a doubt, improves upon the first game in every aspect without feeling that its rehashing anything. It takes a formula already considered perfect and somehow manages to expand it without adding bloat or frustrating complexity. The shift to a Magick-focused protagonist is a refreshing take on the formula and the progression system is unmatched in its ability to keep the player engaged. *Hades II* is a mandatory purchase for any rogue-lite or hack and slash fans. It delivers everything fans of the original could have hoped for and then some. It is the new high-water mark for the rogue-lite genre.",

    "description": "Half-Life: Alyx is an immersive VR narrative experience that captures everything fans expect from a Half-Life game with polished gameplay, insane detail, and excellent storytelling.",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "## Half-Life: Alyx\r\nAn immersive single-player narrative experience that looks, feels, and plays exactly like what you would expect from a Half-Life game. From the gunfights, interactable objects, physics engine, brilliant storytelling, memorable characters, to the immersive environments/levels. This game has got it.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- Polished VR Experience  \r\n- Proper Half-Life game  \r\n- Comfortable to play  \r\n- Insane level of detail  \r\n- Excellent Storytelling  \r\n- Immersive Gameplay  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- Lack of melee combat  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📜Level of detail  \r\nWe’re back to City 17. A very familiar place for Half-Life fans, seeing it in VR with Valve’s modern engine and masterful graphics is jaw-dropping. The city is more detailed than ever; more stuff to pick up, and more objects to interact around. Despite that, it still feels a lot like the city we’ve played in more than a decade ago.\r\n\r\nUnlike most VR games, Half-Life: Alyx does not try hard to make itself too realistic when it comes to VR interactions with the environment, especially with the inventory system. Having said that, there is no HUD. Everything is displayed on Alyx’s gloves and weapons instead.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to get every weapon/item from all around your body, instead they’ll mostly come from a few conveniently well-made simple hand gestures and additional slots for each of your wrists. Ammunitions for reloading that you get from over your shoulder are automatically selected based on the weapon you’re holding. Valve really found the right balance of realism and mechanics here and I love their take on it. Everything feels natural.\r\n\r\nAs with your interactions with the environment, it is insanely detailed. It’s like another level of detail comparable from the jump in detail from 3rd person to 1st person. Now this is 1st person going to VR. Everything seems kind of personal and big. NPC’s are big and detailed, just as big or bigger than me. Objects seem like real objects. Enemies feel really threatening.\r\n\r\nAlmost everything can be picked up. Jars, bottles, glasses, crates, boxes, can be broken. TVs thrown around. Cabinets, drawers, opened. You might even find yourself an ammo or two inside these containers. They also solve the VR item pickup conundrum by the use of Alyx’s gravity hands. It’s no gravity gun from HL2; Much, much weaker, only enough for you to fling almost any small object for you to catch it. No need to walk over an item and crouch down to pick it up.\r\n\r\n## ⚔️Combat  \r\nContinuing the trend of balancing realism vs mechanics, the combat is very well done. You can really feel the weight of the guns as well as their power when shooting. Aiming is accurate and the rumble feedback to my controllers are just right. The reload system they’ve implemented is smooth and reliable. Consistent and repeatable. ♥♥♥♥ ups are more on you than on the game’s mechanic.\r\n\r\nYou can also upgrade your guns through the use of ‘resins’ which are scattered and collected throughout the game. Upgrades like reflex sight (which I hated), and extended magazines are available. I wished they included an option to remove the sights though once I upgraded it as personally I was more comfortable using the iron sight.\r\n\r\nThe enemies, ranging from the mindless zombies, headcrabs, to the combine forces are all back and have been improved upon. Zombies and headcrabs are more unpredictable this time, making them harder to hit. Combine forces can now survive more gunshots, some can deploy shields, and can even deploy Manhacks of their own.\r\n\r\nWith it’s reputable physics engine and VR implementation, Valve missed a huge opportunity with the non-existent melee combat. Nothing can be used for melee: Pipes, bars, concrete blocks, barrels, even guns cannot be used for melee. Melee combat is basically null in this game.\r\n\r\nYou cannot even take advantage of the physics engine to kill off people like throwing stuff at or dropping things on them. For a game that has the crowbar as a series staple, the gravity gun as another, this game has none of any of that.\r\n\r\n## 📖Story  \r\nThe story is well written and engaging. It fleshes out Eli and Alyx’s stories even more. It gives you an idea of what their order of business was like before Gordon Freeman came along. Playing Alyx is somewhat a nice change of pace from playing Gordon Freeman again, it retracts that subconscious idea that your character is a total badass and can single-handedly destroy the enemy. A feeling that we have when playing badass FPS characters like Gordon, Masterchief, Doom Guy, etc. It makes for a game that has a character that seem normal, average, “not the chosen one”, and haven’t proven herself yet. That Half-Life vibe is still there though, especially the humor, bleakness, and mysterious nature.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s not just a side-story or a spin-off; other games are referenced in a much more direct and substantial way. To simply explain without spoilers, you definitely need to have played this or at least watched online before you play any future Half-Life games set after Episode 2.\r\n\r\n## 🗺️Level Design/Pacing  \r\nPersonally I used the full locomotion option as I am playing wirelessly. The FPS-like free movement is handled perfectly. I’ve encountered no dizziness whatsoever. As opposed to other VR games where I’m dizzy 15 minutes in, this one I can play for hours. I think it has something to do with the movement speed which is just perfect for me although some may say it’s a bit slow.\r\n\r\nThe level design is perfect for a VR game. Maps are big and spacious, there’s plenty of room to move around and explore while still preserving that linear map design. You will most certainly find yourself to the next area and you won’t get lost all the time trying to find the next corridor or door to open.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for a VR game, loading screens are still a thing, as the classic Half-Life in-between level loading screens are back. Although they are much more bearable now with a holographic city-map view of your progression ala-Metro 2033 instead of just dull frozen moments with a “Loading” text at the center.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of puzzles in the game. One example are the level puzzles where you need to use physics or interactables; maybe you need to stack some crates, activate some levers, press some buttons, or provide power to some contraption. The transition from pressing a button to VR made all the difference. There are also the various mini-game hacking puzzles that are pretty entertaining. Puzzles are not too hard but will still give you a challenge. Some are straightforward, some might require a bit of critical thinking to solve. They get harder and harder as you progress through.\r\n\r\nAnd of course it isn’t Half-Life without a bit of horror and creepiness. Especially in one part, which is my favorite to say the least. I would say this is where I got the most immersion out of HL: Alyx and one of the strongest points. Truly one of the most horror experiences I had with a video game. This one part terrified me to the point that I was jumping around while playing! And they weren’t using jump scares or any cheap tactic. You’ll definitely know it when you see it.\r\n\r\n## 🖥️Technical Performance  \r\nThe game runs smoothly even with the resolution set to 120% on my rig: i7-8700k, 32GB RAM, and GTX 1080. No crashes, game-breaking bugs, or major glitches I've encountered. Using an Oculus Quest with ALVR, I was able to play wirelessly and experience free stick movement scheme to its fullest.\r\n\r\n## ⚖️Conclusion  \r\nWhile Half-Life: Alyx does not directly continue the series (as obvious in the title), It signifies Valve’s return to form when it comes to making singleplayer games, and they certainly deliver. If this is just Valve’s toes in the water into the Half-Life making business again, then I’m excited for what’s to come.",

    "description": "\"Haven is a compelling, highly stylized adventure that excels as a",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "I first started Haven years ago on Game Pass with my partner, but frankly, it didn't click for us, especially as a co-op or 'couple game.' It’s supposedly a very light sci-fi RPG about two lovers, Yu and Kay, who have fled to an alien but beautiful world to escape an oppressive society and are fighting to keep their relationship alive. \r\n\r\nHowever, despite putting the game down, its cozy atmosphere and unique vibe resonated with me and somehow got ingrained in my mind for years.  \r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n* ❤️ The relationship of the two main characters feels genuinely real, setting a new lowkey standard for a romantic, slice-of-life story in a game.\r\n* 🏡 Masterful, unique cozy vibe that compels you to explore everything and live alongside the characters.\r\n* 🎧 Amazing soundtrack that perfectly syncs with the gameplay.\r\n* 📖 Subtle, unique worldbuilding is highly effective, creating an immersive sci-fi exile without heavy exposition.\r\n* 🎨 The art direction is gorgeous and consistent, creating a visually stunning and cohesive anime-like aesthetic.\r\n* 🫂 The game nails the portrayal of an *established* relationship, focusing on mature intimacy, small arguments, and constant mutual support.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n* 🧱 The gliding controls can occasionally work against the player, leading to small, frustrating moments of movement friction.\r\n* 🎮Coop gameplay feels forced/underbaked, its much better to play this as a solo player.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nThe feeling of being stranded in another world, yet carrying your own cozy environment with you (a ship full of life and personality), set in beautiful landscapes, and equipped with impressive gliding technology, all grew in my imagination. I always imagined returning to it someday after putting it down years ago, keeping it listed in my spreadsheet of \"to play eventually\" Well, that day finally came a few weeks ago when I installed it on my Steam Deck, and in my opinion it works better as a solo experience. \r\n\r\nThe game is marketed as coop, but in my opinion the game works better as as solo player experience (perhaps with your partner just watching you play) because the coop gameplay elements feel underbaked or forced.\r\n\r\nI would argue that Haven is far more of a cozier, calming adventure and romantic couple story than it is the RPG survival game it is often described as, perhaps by even the developers themselves in an attempt to reach a wider audience. The core of the gameplay is navigating a planet full of islets connected by \"flow bridges,\" an energy phenomenon that also powers your impressive gliders, allowing you to seamlessly travel the beautiful landscape, fight corrupted enemies, purify the land, and find resources for crafting and cooking. \r\n\r\nThe gliding is the main traversal method and boy it is fun to zip across the land, giving movement a satisfying rhythm that syncs perfectly with the soundtrack. This traversal method is designed for both solo and coop. In **solo play**, you control both characters simultaneously, they follow each other around. In coop play, one player glides while the other (still following the gliding player) can collect resources and activate boosts. My only **gripe** is that the gliding can sometimes work against the player, but those experiences are few and far between.\r\n\r\n### Intimacy, Worldbuilding, and the Slice-of-Life beauty\r\n\r\nThe game’s narrative strength lies in its subtle and unique worldbuilding. The lore uses sci-fi and Orwellian elements, mixed with post-apocalyptic and survival themes, but without the darkness, grittiness, or extreme hardships. This unique tone is supported by the narrative structure: the game inserts you directly into the middle of Yu and Kay’s adventure, without needing to explain every single thing at the get-go. When some exposition does arrive, it feels earned, and you truly appreciate the storytelling and the lore. The result is an experience that is deeply immersive, almost like you’re sitting by a campfire with the characters, living alongside them in that universe. I just love the premise of being stranded in a beautiful paradise with a cozy ship full of life with a partner, that i actually want that to happen to me.\r\n\r\nThis immersive atmosphere is built upon the perfect chemistry between the two leads. Yu and Kay talk and interact like a *real* couple. They sound like a real couple. Not every conversation has to be plot-heavy; some are just happy, playful banter, some involve just looking at the sky gazing at the stars, and some are just glazing at how delicious the food is. It truly feels genuine, achieving a slice-of-life quality, but set in their unique sci-fi exile, not our regular world. That genuine feel is very rarely seen in games involving romantic couples. The game's narrative is very immersive, focusing on the realistic chemistry of the couple through mundane yet intimate dialogue, a feat only made possible by the high-quality, convincing performances from both voice actors.\r\n\r\n### Combat: Simple, Yet Fits The Game nicely\r\n\r\nI was initially afraid that combat would be tedious or detract from the cozy vibe, especially since the first few hours focus solely on the gliding and exploration. Turns out, it wasn't that way, and it complemented the game perfectly. The fighting is best described as a rock-paper-scissors-like system; some enemies are weak to Blast, some to Impact, and often you need to time a guard or stun them with one character before following up with a quick pre-charged attack from the other. You command both characters, using the D-pad for Kay and the face buttons for Yu, with just five commands in total for each. \r\n\r\nWhile the combat isn't very deep, it’s not as basic as I expected, and coordinating these commands gives the system a satisfying tactile feel. Although the fighting will get repetitive a few hours towards the end, especially against weaker enemies, a major saving grace is the \"fast forward auto combat\" option, which takes care of that aspect automatically at five times the speed, as long as the characters are have levelled enough to take care of them on their own. \r\n\r\nYou’ll have to learn to command both characters simultaneously for solo play, but for coop play, you get to focus on your one character's commands, at the expense of having to coordinate your attacks with your coop friend.\r\n\r\nYour characters gain strength over the course of the game by building their relationship meter. You level up this bond by nearly everything you do together, from cooking and sleeping to talking, or fighting enemies.\r\n\r\n### Stylish With A Banger Soundtrack\r\n\r\nThe overall aesthetic is stunning and cohesive, favoring a beautiful mix of anime and watercolor-pastel art style for the alien landscapes, creatures, and characters. This visual care extends to every detail, including the loading screens and menus, which are filled with gorgeous, personalized snapshots of Yu and Kay's relationship. Instead of generic tips, these pieces of art constantly provide intimate flavor and personality, the developers didn't even need to add these loading screen touches, but they understood that such detail is essential to reinforcing the game's central theme of enduring love. Simple things but it added so much to the personality of the game.\r\n\r\nAlso, the amazing banger electro-like soundtrack helped seal the deal for me.  It elevates the gameplay into an relaxing but rhythmic experience that defines the literal flow of exploration. This energetic score is perfectly balanced by softer, intimate pieces in dialogue and romantic moments, effectively amplifying the contrast between external adventure and the cozy domestic life of the couple in their ship.\r\n\r\nAnd I won’t forget about describing the opening sequence, which was nothing short of **stunning** and acts as an immediate emotional investment hook to rapidly tell the story of Yu and Kay's established, passionate love in beautiful colors and animation.\r\n\r\n### The Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe soothing, cozy aspect of the game completely changed my habits: I'm never much of a completionist, but this game made me go out and explore every nook and cranny of the world, purifying everything, finding every ingredient to cook, eating all the dishes, and experiencing all the dialogue it has to offer.\r\n\r\nHaven is overall a very calming, soothing, cozy experience wrongfully disguised as an RPG. It’s actually an adventure game with a heavy focus on a genuine, realistic, romantic story set in a unique sci-fi world. The 10-15 hour experience is definitely one of the best short experiences I’ve had in a while, and I think it’s a type of game that will stick with me for years to come. My only hope is that we get an eventual sequel.",

    "tags": "",
    "body": "**Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** initially raised some skepticism for me because of its first-person perspective, I really thought I wont like it because of the first person view, because i played Uncharted and Tomb Raider and I wanted those kind of games. I thought I knew better. However, I was proven wrong, as the first-person viewpoint here works remarkably well, creating a more immersive and personal experience that brings you closer to Indy’s world. \r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🕵️ Engaging first-person puzzles that feel natural and rewarding  \r\n- 🤜 Combat style that captures the clumsy, scrappy feel of Indiana Jones  \r\n- 🐍 Atmospheric environments that bring the adventure to life  \r\n- 🎮 Phenomenal performance from Troy Baker as Indiana Jones\r\n- 🎵 Strong audio design with thematic music and voice acting  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🐢 Stealth feels rudimentary and underdeveloped compared to other aspects  \r\n- 📉 Some pacing issues early on that slow momentum  \r\n- ⚙️ Occasional technical rough edges and AI glitches  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-12-24-indiana-jones-great-circle-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nI would like to repeat again, that the first person view absolutely works! Not only your in tune and more immersed as Indy, you also get upclose and personal with the puzzles and locations, which can now be much more cramped and smaller because of the view. It allows you to lean in and inspect ancient mechanisms, decipher cryptic markings up close, and feel a genuine sense of tension as you peer into a dark, unknown passage. The puzzles are a major highlight; they strike an excellent balance between being challenging enough to make you feel clever and intuitive enough to avoid unfair frustration. This isn’t just watching a hero solve a mystery; you are the hero, you are Indiana Jones, and the feeling of discovery is consistently rewarding.\r\n\r\n     \r\nCombat is simple but effective. It effectively captures the clumsy, scrappy feel of Indiana Jones. This isn't the slick, high-octane combat of a superspy; it's the desperate brawl of a professor who's in over his head. Punches feel weighty, the iconic bullwhip is both a tool and a weapon, and scarce ammo forces you to be resourceful rather than relying on brute force. This grounded approach is a refreshing change of pace that feels authentic to the character.\r\n\r\nThe stealth mechanics however, being a major part of the gameplay, are more rudimentary. You can sneak past enemies or set up simple ambushes, but these segments feel basic and underdeveloped compared to the rest of the game. They are passable and serve their purpose, but lack the depth to be a true highlight.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-12-24-indiana-jones-great-circle-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nThe game’s greatest success is its atmosphere. The environments are richly detailed and immersive, from the humid air of jungle ruins to the chilling echoes of forgotten tombs. Excellent level design is complemented by masterful lighting and soundscapes that build a palpable sense of tension and excitement. The audio design is strong across the board, with a stirring, thematic musical score and solid voice acting that brings the characters to life, making the world feel authentic and exciting to explore. The game features Troy Baker as Indiana Jones, and he did a phenomenal job as Indy, sounding absolutely like Indy in the films without a doubt. All in all it just feels like you're watching and listening to an Indiana Jones film. I don't think the graphics are aiming for photorealism, more like stylized graphics, but it looks realistic anyway and its very impressive, especially on Path Tracing modes.\r\n  </div>\r\nWhile the game delivers a fantastic adventure, it's not without some rough edges. The narrative suffers from some pacing issues early on, taking a bit of time to find its adventurous rhythm. Especially since the after the tutorial, the game puts you at the heart of the Vatican, and it could take a while before you end up in mountains, jungles, or deserts. I also encountered occasional technical glitches and AI quirks that, while not game-breaking, briefly pulled me out of the experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2024-12-24-indiana-jones-great-circle-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n     <div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n**Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** successfully translates the iconic adventurer’s tale from the big screen into a surprisingly effective first-person perspective in video game form. Its engaging puzzles, distinctive combat, and incredibly atmospheric world, combined with phenomenal performance from Troy Baker as Indy, create an adventure that truly captures the spirit of the films. I would have no problem if someone would say that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the fifth Indiana Jones entry in the series.\r\n  </div>  </div>",

    "body": "**Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (KCD2)** is the ultimate sandbox medieval RPG experience, delivering an unparalleled level of immersion and roleplaying depth. With a sprawling open world, branching questlines, and historically grounded storytelling, it stands as one of the most ambitious RPGs of recent times, maybe even of all times.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- ⚔️ Deep, realistic combat system with authentic medieval mechanics  \r\n- 🌍 Immersive open world rich in historical detail and environmental storytelling  \r\n- 📜 Branching quests with multiple outcomes and player choices  \r\n- 🎭 Strong narrative that respects player agency and roleplaying freedom  \r\n- 🔧 Significant optimization improvements and bug fixes from the first game  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🐞 Some quest bugs and logic issues still disrupt immersion occasionally  \r\n- ⚔️ Combat changes simplify directional inputs, losing some tactical nuance  \r\n- 🐢 Quest pacing can feel slow, especially in early-game segments  \r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-06-27-kcd2-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n\r\n**Kingdom Come: Deliverance II** is a realistic, first-person, open-world RPG and serves as the direct sequel to the first game, the game continues the story of Henry of Skalitz, a common blacksmith's son thrust into the chaos of a 15th-century civil war in Bohemia. Players once again navigate a historically accurate medieval world, but on a much larger scale, featuring the bustling city of Kuttenberg, its surrounding vast countryside, and the region of Trosky. The game is renowned for its commitment to realism, ditching fantasy elements for a grounded experience focused on authentic combat, deep roleplaying systems, sim-like hardcore elements, and a story of revenge, politics, and personal growth.\r\n</div>\r\nThe story is long but beautiful and incredibly rewarding. Its just really well-written, and it makes the whole world feel alive in addition to the already hardcore and sim-like nature. You can see this quality in everything, from Henry's main plot to even the smallest side quests. Because all the characters and situations feel so real and thought-out, the quests are more than just a checklist or a game length padder; they actually connect with you and are so well thought-out. There are so many memorable quests or encounters here, just like the first game. The different branching paths and tough choices get you invested, so you really care about what happens because of your actions. It just makes the game feel like a living world where your decisions truly matter.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note, however, that this is a direct sequel. The narrative picks up right where the first game left off, and while it does a decent job of providing context through occasional exposition in some of the dialogue --- giving you a general idea of prior events, it’s still best experienced after playing the original to fully appreciate the single, continuous story.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-06-27-kcd2-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nThe quest design in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is what makes the game truly exceptional. This is a legitimate role-playing game. Unlike many RPGs with linear objectives, quests here are complex, multi-layered problems that can be solved in numerous ways, encouraging true roleplaying. Nearly every quest has multiple outcomes based on your actions and choices. A simple task to retrieve a stolen item can end with you persuading the thief, intimidating him, stealing it back silently, or engaging in a messy brawl that draws the attention of the city guard. Your choices have real, often unforeseen, consequences that can even alter future quests and character relationships, up to the very end of the game. The game constantly rewards you for thinking like your character. A high Speech skill might allow you to talk your way out of a deadly confrontation, while a skilled Lockpicker can bypass a heavily guarded entrance entirely. Even your current gear or clothing affects the dialogue. Even your current gear or clothing affects the dialogue. For example, wear a knight's armor and you can probably intimidate your way out of conversations. Conversely, dress like a beggar and people will treat you like one.\r\n</div>\r\nSimilar to the quest design, the story is filled with choices and branches that have a real impact, making every playthrough feel personal and unique. The world itself is a marvel, a historically accurate 15th-century Bohemia brought to life with painstaking detail. From a technical standpoint, the game is also a huge leap forward, running far more smoothly and with fewer bugs than the first game did at launch. It’s not 100% perfect, as I still encountered some quest logic bugs from time to time, but the overall experience is polished and stable. I can even run it on my Steam Deck at 30-40 FPS, which is highly impressive.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-06-27-kcd2-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n  <div> \r\nThe game's combat is one of its most unique features, it is quite realistic, methodical, and hardcore. It is far from the usual when it comes to combat systems where you could usually take on many enemies at once, here, even one on one will be difficult enough. The system is a challenging dance of timing, positioning, and weapon choice that makes every encounter feel weighty and earned. \r\n\r\nMy one and only significant gripe in this game is how the combat has devolved from the first game. The unique and quirky system is still there, but it has been simplified. Instead of six directional inputs for your attacks and blocks, the system is now down to four. The center attack was removed, and the lower left and right options were combined into one. While this might make the combat more approachable for newcomers and helped attract a more mainstream audience, I feel it has reduced the tactical depth that made the original’s swordplay so demanding and uniquely satisfying.\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-06-27-kcd2-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n  <div> \r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nKingdom Come: Deliverance II is the ultimate sandbox, the ultimate open-world, and literal role-playing game. It’s a title where the possibilities feel endless, a true medieval simulator that stands as one of the most immersive RPGs I have ever played. The sheer effort the developers invested into creating countless branching paths and quest outcomes is staggering; I can’t even imagine the complexity behind it. For this immersiveness factor alone, part of me wants this game to win Game of the Year, just so more people can recognize and appreciate what an incredible achievement this is.\r\n</div> </div>",

    "body": "**Metaphor: ReFantazio** is a compelling turn-based RPG that combines classic turn-based combat with fresh mechanics and a captivating story.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🎭 Dynamic combat system allowing on-the-fly class changes  \r\n- 📖 Rich, intriguing narrative with immersive cutscenes  \r\n- 🎨 Vibrant and detailed visuals with expressive character animations  \r\n- 🎵 Atmospheric soundtrack enhancing the mood  \r\n- ⚔️ Combat is addictive without feeling repetitive  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 🖱️ Overly sensitive camera and control settings that can frustrate players  \r\n- 🐢 Some pacing issues, especially during story-heavy segments  \r\n- 🚪 Limited slice-of-life moments reduce world immersion  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-04-02-metaphor-refantazio-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Metaphor: ReFantazio Review\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n  <div> \r\n\r\nThe king is dead, the throne is empty, and a deadly curse afflicts the only true heir. This is the world of **Metaphor: ReFantazio**, a high-fantasy epic that immediately throws players into a high-stakes race for power. A grand tournament has been declared to find the next ruler, but for you, the quest is far more personal.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I started my playthrough of **Metaphor: ReFantazio**, it becomes clear that this is something different. From the creative minds behind the Persona series, this game leverages a familiar, stylish blueprint but applies it to a fascinating new world full of wonder, creating an experience that is both comfortably recognizable and refreshingly unique, in many aspects.\r\n\r\n  </div>   </div> \r\nThe Persona footprint is immediately visible everywhere you look. From the slick, high-energy UI and calendar-based progression to the distinct camera angles and movement, fans of the series will feel right at home (I even had to lower the camera sensitivity, just like in Persona!). The presentation is gorgeous, with cutscenes that feel like you're watching a high-budget anime.\r\n\r\nHowever, where Metaphor carves its own path is in its focus. The deep \"slice-of-life\" simulation of the Persona games is largely absent here. Instead of balancing school life with dungeon crawling, this experience is laser-focused on the grand journey and the mission at hand. There are still light social elements, like bonding with your companions by eating at an inn at the end of the day, but the game is fundamentally about the quest, not the daily life between quests. The game's social elements come into play with the follower system, by strengthening your bonds with your Followers, you unlock new abilities and powerful new Archetypes (which are basically the classes in this game), making social progression feel integral to the journey itself, rather than a separate daily activity.\r\n\r\nThe combat system, while it follows a typical Persona or Shin Megami Tensei formula is the game's crowning achievement. At first, it appears to be real-time, but it’s a clever hybrid system. In the overworld, you can dash and attack enemies directly, but once you interact with enemies, you can enter a turn-based combat which is where most of the gameplay is focused on. One good thing that I love is, If you're powerful enough, you can defeat weaker mobs right then and there, completely bypassing the turn-based battle instance. This single feature is a brilliant innovation that dramatically reduces the repetitive \"rinse and repeat\" grind common in many turn-based JRPGs.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-04-02-metaphor-refantazio-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Metaphor: ReFantazio Review\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nWhen you do enter a full battle, the turn-based combat is deep and addictive. The standout feature is the Archetype system, which allows your characters to change their class or job on the fly. This opens up a plethora of build combinations and strategic possibilities, a massive improvement over games where characters are permanently locked into specific skillsets. It encourages experimentation and keeps the combat feeling fresh for dozens of hours. Not to mention you can upgrade archetypes and essentially mix and match them together and come up with some pretty interesting synergy builds.\r\ns.\r\n  </div>\r\nThe presentation is gorgeous, with cutscenes that feel like you're watching an anime, wait, it IS an anime, at some parts. The story, while perhaps a bit uninteresting at the very start, builds momentum beautifully, becoming incredibly compelling by its midway point. The world-building is particularly thought-provoking. The protagonist reads an illustrated storybook that seems to be about our modern world, and even more curiously, the monsters roaming the land are referred to as \"Humans.\" It sparks fascinating theories: what if this is a glimpse into our own world's distant future, and that book is not a fantasy, but a history text? It's these intriguing details that make the world so captivating and the story so unique in my perspective.\r\n\r\nThe narrative unfolds as a political journey across the kingdom. Traveling in your mobile base, you must visit different regions, solve their unique problems, and win the trust and belief of their people to build your support. You'll interact with a rich cast of characters, from the allies who become your loyal Followers to the other charismatic rivals competing for the throne, all while uncovering the deeper mysteries of the world, such as the nature of the monstrous creatures known as \"Humans.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-04-02-metaphor-refantazio-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Metaphor: ReFantazio Review\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nThe game's cel-shaded art style is one of its most unique features. It masterfully blends a classic high-fantasy aesthetic with a distinctly modern and stylish sensibility. It still looks Persona-ish but its medieval now.  A major highlight is the game's UI. Much like in the Persona series, navigating menus is an experience in itself. The UI is incredibly dynamic, using bold typography, energetic transitions, and a striking color palette of gold, black, and red to make every action feel impactful and stylish. This unique visual identity is integral to the game's personality.\r\n</div>\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-04-02-metaphor-refantazio-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Metaphor: ReFantazio Review\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n  <div> \r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n**Metaphor: ReFantazio** is a masterful blend of the old and the new. It successfully transplants the beloved, stylish formula of the Persona series into a new high-fantasy world, all while innovating on the turn-based combat formula in truly new meaningful ways. While those looking for a deep life-sim might miss that aspect, the game's compelling world, addictive combat, and incredible sense of style make it an absolute must-play for JRPG fans and a serious contender for Game of the Year.\r\n</div></div>",

    "description": "\"Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a triumphant action RPG built on a",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "I was a huge fan of the first game, *Shadow of Mordor*. So when *Shadow of War* was announced, promising a bigger scale of the same formula - a third-person action-adventure RPG that felt like a hybrid of the **Batman Arkham** and **Assassin's Creed** series - I was immediately excited. What could possibly go wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n\r\n* ⚔️ The Nemesis, Follower, and Fortress systems all deliver a highly addictive, dynamic cycle of personalized conquest and betrayal. A much expanded system from the first game.\r\n\r\n* 📜 The story takes a bold, compelling \"What If\" approach to *Lord of the Rings* lore, which ultimately works brilliantly as a fresh take.\r\n\r\n* 💥 The combat system remains a satisfying free-flow experience, allowing you to fluidly chain attacks, counters, and diverse abilities.\r\n\r\n* 💍 The addictive gear system constantly rewards you for completing specific challenges to unlock each item's legendary power.\r\n\r\n* 🗺️ Side quests are so well-designed and integrated that their storytelling matches the quality of the main campaign.\r\n\r\n* 📱 The graphics still hold up exceptionally well, and the game is a fantastic fit for the Steam Deck, running great on the go.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n* 🐌 The first few hours can be slow, and could act as a significant barrier, as the game takes too long to ramp up and hook the player.\r\n\r\n* 🔗 The larger scale and multiple maps results in a less tight experience where the different regions can feel disjointed and not connected to each other especially with regards to the Nemesis system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWell, as it turned out, the launch was botched by the inclusion of a pay-to-win system and excessive, grindy elements. I was so put off that I totally lost all the hype and ignore the game on release. Being the patient gamer that I am, I was able to finally try the game in 2021, the microtransactions were gone, but something about the early hours still didn't click for me. i didnt get hooked in enough to play past the the first area. Maybe it was because the cool abilities from the end of the first game were gone because the main character got nerfed in the story (understandably), or maybe the massive scale felt overwhelming. Whatever the reason, the game just didn't hook me. I dropped it, refunded it, and for years, I was content to believe I'd never play it again.\r\n\r\nThat all changed this year when I got a free key of the game thanks to a friends Humble Monthly sub. I activated the game and decided to relegate the game as a Steam Deck “exclusive” to play on the go. And wow, it's absolutely perfect for the handheld. The performance is fantastic, especially with lossless scaling, and playing it on the OLED screen is a phenomenal experience. I had to power through the same initial two-to-three-hour slog that killed my first attempt, but once I did, everything finally clicked. What started as just supposed to be occasional game I'd play on breaks quickly became a staple, and I ended up beating it in just a few days.\r\n\r\nThat slow start is, without a doubt, the worst part of the game. However, once you push through it, the rest of the experience is incredibly rewarding. The game's narrative finds its footing, the **RPG progression** becomes compelling, and the famously patented **Nemesis and Follower systems** become incredibly addictive. The combat remains the same satisfying free-flow style of its predecessor, allowing you to fluidly take on multiple enemies at once with a satisfying mix of attacks, counters, and a plethora of moves without missing the beat. You can chain together **executions** to instantly kill enemies, perform **ground finishers** on downed foes, or unleash a powerful **Elven Light** blast to stun and blind entire groups. Not to mention the ranged combat moves you can perform and how you can mount beasts like Caragors.\r\n\r\nThe story of *Shadow of War* acts as a compelling \"What If\" scenario, feeling more like a high-quality fan fiction than a canonical part of Tolkien's world. It's a plausible tale that explores an alternative path for Middle-earth's heroes, particularly with its focus on Celebrimbor and a new Ring of Power. However, it's so well-integrated with the lore, especially the cinematic versions, that you can almost pretend it's a hidden chapter that inserts itself nicely within, at least the lore of the movies. The events can fit neatly between *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, offering a fresh perspective on the war against Sauron without directly contradicting the films' narrative. It expands on familiar themes and settings, making it feel both fresh and comfortably familiar to fans of the movies. Purist might hate how the game “breaks” the lore and the canon, but personally, I love their take on it. Dare I say, I wish more video game adaptations were this bold and liberated; it’s a creative risk that pays off nicely.\r\n\r\nThe literal patented “Nemesis” system, which is truly the heart of the experience, is what makes the game shine. It procedurally generates a unique army of named Orc captains, each with their own distinct strengths, weaknesses, personalities, and relationships. These captains will remember your previous encounters. If one kills you, he'll level up, grow more powerful, and might even get a new title to commemorate his victory. This creates a genuine sense of rivalry. \r\n\r\nAs you progress, you can dominate these captains and turn them into your own loyal followers. You'll command them to betray their former allies, assassinate rival warlords, or act as your personal bodyguards. You'll also use this system to lay siege to massive fortresses, commanding your orc army to assault the gates and eventually topple the fortress’s overlord.\r\n\r\nThe Nemesis System's addictive nature lies in how it turns every encounter into a strategic puzzle and a personal narrative. It gives you a choice: you can **methodically dismantle the enemy's hierarchy**, systematically targeting captains, dominating them to turn them to your side, or killing them to weaken the fortress's defenses from the ground up. By taking out key captains and their bodyguards, you can reduce the number of enemies you'll face inside and even turn the Warchiefs against their Overlord, making the final assault a breeze. Or, if you're feeling confident, you can **rise to the challenge** and bypass the whole process, taking on the fortress and its Overlord head-on from the very start. Either way, the system creates an endless cycle of betrayal, revenge, and conquest that makes every victory feel uniquely earned. \r\n\r\nEven the quest system is a huge win for the game. The side quests are so well-formatted and thoughtfully designed that their storytelling is on par with the main campaign. They don’t feel like an afterthought; in fact, without the proper icons, you’d have a hard time telling which are part of the main story and which are not. Many are also directly integrated into the progression and item systems, giving you excellent incentives to complete them.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the surprisingly compelling item system. It's so much more than just finding better loot. Every piece of gear you pick up, your sword, dagger, armor, and even your ring, has its own set of stats and unique perks. What makes it so addictive is that you can \"awaken\" each item's true power by completing a specific challenge, like killing a certain type of orc or performing a specific combat move, you can unlock a new perk and upgrade the item to legendary status. This creates a constant loop of discovery and personal challenge, where you're always excited to find new gear and put in the work to make it truly yours. It's a system that consistently rewards your investment and makes you feel powerful.\r\n\r\nMy only minor gripes are the frequent repetition of Orc names and that the Orcs (and your nemesis/followers) can’t really transfer seamlessly between areas/fortresses without jumping  bunch of hoops, the different areas feel disjointed as a result. And it isn’t as tight of an experience as the first game because of the bigger scale. Lastly, while the parkour system is generally smooth, it occasionally has a mind of its own, snapping to ledges or jumping to walls you didn’t intend to, in a way that feels similar to the *Assassin's Creed* titles.\r\n\r\nAside from these gripes, the game is a triumph. While I played most of the campaign on my Steam Deck, I switched to my desktop PC for the final few hours to crank up the visuals and experience it at its full glory. And to my surprise, the graphics hold up exceptionally well. *Shadow of War* looks every bit as good as a modern AAA title and could easily pass as one if it were released today.\r\n\r\nDespite its rocky launch and a frustrating first attempt, *Middle-earth: Shadow of War* ultimately redeemed itself completely for me. A chance encounter was all it took for me to realize that its incredible core gameplay, fueled by the highly addictive **Nemesis, Follower, and Fortress systems**, creates a fantastic experience. Its emergent storytelling, set against the backdrop of the masterpiece that is the *Lord of the Rings* universe, truly makes it a worthy and triumphant sequel to the first one.",

    "title": "The Most Creative, Imaginative, Co-op Game To Date | Split Fiction Review",
    "description": "Split Fiction is an exclusively two-player experience defined by",
    "tags": "",
    "body": "When Hazelight, the studio behind co-op classics like *A Way Out* and *It Takes Two (a GOTY winner, by the way)*, releases a new game, people pay attention. Their latest title, *Split Fiction*, had a lot to live up to when it was revealed at last year’s The Game Awards. Fortunately, the game absolutely delivers: it's an incredible achievement in game design and sets a new bar for couch co-op. However, while the gameplay is brilliant and constantly surprising, the story holding it all together is disappointingly simple.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n* 🧠 One of the most original and inventive level designs and game mechanics ever conceived.\r\n* ❤️ The absolute gold standard for couple's or split-screen gaming experiences.\r\n* 🎢 Constantly jumps between themes, levels, and mechanics, keeping the experience fresh.\r\n* 🤣 Full of fun, comedy, and engaging banter between the two leads.\r\n* 🕹️ Extremely user-friendly controls cater perfectly to casual or new players.\r\n* 🎨 A visually vibrant, coherent world where fantasy and sci-fi mesh beautifully.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n* 📖 The overarching story is basic, forgettable, and lacks the emotional depth of previous titles.\r\n* ⚠️ The high level of accessibility leaves seasoned gamers wanting a difficulty toggle or challenge options.\r\n\r\n*Split Fiction* is an exclusively two-player experience defined by its literal split screen. You cannot play this game in single player mode or with just one screen. It s always split-screen coop for the entirety of the experience. \r\nThe brilliance lies in how the game seamlessly weaves together contrasting worlds of sci-fi and fantasy, switching between Mio's cyberpunk sci-fi worlds and Zoe's magical fantasy realms as the story progresses. This dynamic split-screen design introduces dozens of unique gameplay mechanics every level, constantly reinventing itself with new abilities, powers, and challenges that require precise communication and coordination between both players. It has arguably **one of the most creative level and game mechanic designs for a co-op game, or any video game, ever.**\r\n\r\n## **Constant Gameplay Innovation From Start To Finish**\r\n\r\nThe sheer flow of original ideas in *Split Fiction* is why this game is so essential. It forces you and your partner to constantly invent new ways to interact across the dimensional divide. You’ll be convinced that this is it, this is the peak of the game, the devs must have probably ran out of the ideas, only for **them to go and impress you again on the very next level.** This relentless creativity continues right up to the credits; the game **never runs out of fresh concepts.**\r\n\r\nThe mechanical puzzles are stunningly diverse. In one section, Zoe transforms into a Groot-like being to manipulate deadly flowers and force them to recede, while Mio shapeshifts into an amphibian creature to drag them both across piranha-infested waters. Later, Mio and Zoe find themselves on opposite sides of a room blocked by color-coded force fields, requiring them to shoot grenades at boxes on a conveyor belt and time their blasts perfectly to break through barriers. In another puzzle, Mio uses her ape transformation to push an ice cube while Zoe lifts tiles on the grid in her tree form, creating barriers that guide the cube to its destination.\r\n\r\nThe imaginative scale of these interactions is breathtaking and never runs out until the game ends. Importantly, the game maintains **outstanding pacing that keeps you jumping from multiple different levels, themes, and game mechanics every once in a while.** No puzzle drags on too long, and no single combat style becomes repetitive. You might however, love certain sections so much that you’d want to replay these again in the future, and that’s certainly possible since you can revisit the different levels in the game if you wanted to.\r\n\r\n## **The Ultimate Date Night Game**\r\n\r\nThis exceptional cooperative focus solidifies *Split Fiction*'s reputation as **the best co-op, split-screen, or couple’s game available, probably on par and even surpassing Hazelight’s own *It Takes Two* in some aspects**. It is impossible to succeed without genuine communication and trust, making it a perfect choice for couples or friends who want a deeply shared, problem-solving experience.\r\n\r\nThe tone is another major asset. The experience is **full of fun and comedy, lighthearted but with a touch of seriousness** that grounds the plot when it needs to. The banter between the protagonists – one reserved and pragmatic, and one cheerful and optimistic – is genuinely funny and a good dynamic. The world is a joy to inhabit, and the design frequently encourages players to spend a moment messing around before tackling the next big objective.\r\n\r\n## **A Very Accessible Game**\r\n\r\nConsidering the main selling point is coop, and that coop play is probably with someone who’s not a gamer, the entire game is **very accessible to casual players.** Platforming segments are forgiving, and even the aiming mechanics are simplified with slight assists and magnetized jump ledges. This ensures that players of all skill levels can remain engaged and, crucially, that neither partner feels like they are the anchor slowing the team down.\r\n\r\nHowever, this ease of use is a double-edged sword for the seasoned gamer. The game might come across as a little too easy for veteran players, and there is currently no way to up the challenge, at least for a specific player. There should be \"reverse accessibility\" settings for veterans, allowing them to turn off magnetism, aim assist, platforming assists, and other helpful features for them only. Hazelight has perfected the ability to make players feel clever, but they have yet to master the art of making veterans feel truly tested.\r\n\r\n## **A Beautiful Traditional Game**\r\n\r\nBeyond the mechanics, *Split Fiction* delivers a gorgeous audiovisual experience. The game **runs great and looks great.** It doesn't rely on cutting-edge graphical tricks like ray tracing or frame generation; instead, it uses a **pure, traditional style of graphics.** The vibrant color palette and smooth, highly detailed character models give the impression that you are inside a **highly interactive, top-tier 3D animated movie.**\r\n\r\nThe art direction is magnificent. Despite constantly shifting between fantasy and sci-fi aesthetics, the game **loses no sense of identity.** Everything meshes seamlessly together, from the colors and the environments to the characters themselves, creating one coherent, imaginative world. The atmosphere is further bolstered by a fantastic soundtrack that shifts effortlessly between sweeping orchestral scores for the fantasy side and pulsing synth-wave beats for the futuristic settings.\r\n\r\n## **The Simplistic Narrative**\r\n\r\nThe story, while functional, is easily the game's weakest element. The setup – two writers trapped in a simulation by Rader Publishing's CEO, who plans to harvest their creative ideas—is simple and often predictable. It Takes Two elevated its premise with the emotional complexity of a crumbling marriage, delivering Pixar-caliber storytelling that gave weight to every mechanic. \r\n\r\nSplit Fiction opts for a more straightforward \"tech villain\" narrative that, while serviceable, rarely reaches beyond familiar beats. The corporate antagonist feels more buffoonish than menacing, and the overarching plot lacks the thematic depth that made the previous game's relationship drama so compelling.\r\n\r\nTo its credit, the developers manage to save face with strong character writing. They do a solid job developing the relationship between the two protagonists, making their individual journeys and back-and-forth dialogue interesting enough to sustain the adventure. But the core narrative lacks the emotional weight and thematic complexity that made the studio’s previous work so memorable.\r\n\r\n## **Conclusion**\r\n\r\n*Split Fiction* is an absolutely mandatory purchase for anyone seeking a truly collaborative and awesomely cool gaming experience. It is a masterpiece of game mechanics and level design, constantly surprising, entertaining, and visually stunning. It provides dozens of hours of pure co-op fun. (We clocked in at 20+ hrs beating it). While the overarching story is weak and experienced players will long for a difficulty toggle, these minor flaws are easily forgiven when faced with the overwhelming amount of creativity poured into every scene. Grab a friend and experience some of the most innovative design in modern gaming; you won’t regret it.",

    "body": "**Star Wars Outlaws** offers a decent shooter experience within a richly realized Star Wars universe. While its gunplay and environments shine, the story, gameplay elements, and depth hold it back from greatness.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n- 🔫 Tight, satisfying gunplay mechanics  \r\n- 🌌 Stunning and authentic Star Wars environments  \r\n- 🎨 Impressive lighting and visual effects  \r\n- 🎯 Good pacing in combat sequences  \r\n- 🎮 Decent stealth mechanics when working properly  \r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n- 📖 Story is uninspired with unlikable main characters  \r\n- 🤨 Suspension of disbelief broken by some stealth inconsistencies (e.g., punching armored stormtroopers)  \r\n- ⚠️ Occasional bugs and AI quirks detract from immersion  \r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-04-17-star-wars-outlaws-1.avif\r\n    alt=\"Star Wars Outlaws\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n**Star Wars Outlaws** presents a tantalizing proposition: a gritty, open-world adventure set in the criminal underworld of a galaxy far, far away. That sounds like the recipe for a masterpiece, doesn't it? Unfortunately, a great premise doesn't automatically make a masterpiece—and Star Wars Outlaws is proof. However, don't rule it just yet.\r\n\r\nI dove into Star Wars Outlaws as part of my one-month Ubisoft+ subscription, mainly to make my money's worth after Assassin's Creed Shadows. With that context, and for practically zero additional cost, was it worth my time? Absolutely. In fact, I would say the game is underrated for how it's often perceived online. It's a decent game and a decent Star Wars shooter, delivering moments of genuine brilliance that are unfortunately held back by a few significant flaws.\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\nThe game's strongest asset is its incredible presentation. The graphics are amazing, especially when you're taking in the world itself. The lighting, the environmental detail, and the sweeping landscapes all pay perfect respect to what Star Wars looks and feels like. From the dusty, sun-beaten streets of a desert moon to the neon glow of criminal dens, the atmosphere is simply fantastic. However, this visual excellence is most apparent when you’re not looking at the human character models, which unfortunately don't quite reach the same level of quality as the stunning worlds they inhabit.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-04-17-star-wars-outlaws-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"Star Wars Outlaws\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nGameplay wise, the gunplay in this game also shines. The third-person shooting is tight, responsive, and satisfying, making every firefight an exciting and fluid engagement. This solid combat core is the anchor of the gameplay experience. As with other modern Ubisoft games, the structure will feel very familiar to many players. The open world is broken into distinct planets, each acting as its own large map filled with points of interest, and there's a detailed reputation system that tracks your standing with various criminal syndicates. While some may find this formulaic, it provides a solid foundation for the action.\r\n</div>\r\nThe gameplay loop is built around living the life of an up-and-coming outlaw. The questing sends you across the galaxy on various scoundrel-themed missions—from high-stakes heists and smuggling runs to tracking down valuable bounties. As with the aforementioned reputation system, completing a job for the Pyke Syndicate might earn you their favor and unlock exclusive gear, but it could simultaneously sour your relationship with their rivals on that specific planet. This system adds a welcome layer of choice to your journey through the underworld, making you think carefully about your allegiances.\r\n\r\nYou're also never truly alone, thanks to your loyal companion, Nix. This small, clever creature is a key gameplay tool, capable of distracting enemies, fetching weapons, retrieving distant objects, and activating switches, adding a unique and helpful dynamic to both stealth and combat. And most of all, he's cute.\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-04-17-star-wars-outlaws-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"Star Wars Outlaws\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nUnfortunately, this fantastic setting is home to a story that feels uninspired. I found the main character, Kay Vess, to be not that likeable, which makes it difficult to get invested in her personal journey. The narrative lacks the spark and memorable characters that define the best Star Wars adventures. and I'm not even talking about her appearance, which is usually a point of contention online. I really don't have problems with how she looks, its really just the writing. \r\n</div>\r\nThis is compounded by gameplay choices that can shatter the suspension of disbelief. The stealth system, while functional, has moments that are hard to ignore, most notably the ability to knock out a fully armored stormtrooper—complete with a helmet—with a single punch from your bare hands. It's moments like these that pull you out of an otherwise immersive world.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-04-17-star-wars-outlaws-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"Star Wars Outlaws\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nOverall though, **Star Wars Outlaws** is a decent, often beautiful, and likely underrated shooter set in the Star Wars galaxy that absolutely nails the look and feel of its world. Its excellent gunplay, solid questing loop, and stunning environments make it well worth your time, especially if you can access it through a cheap subscription like Ubisoft+ or on a deep sale. It falls short of being a Star Wars video game classic due to its weak story and some questionable gameplay choices, but it's a fun and action-packed trip through the galaxy nonetheless.</<div></div>",

At first, I didn't know what kind of game it was, aside from some online recommendations and getting the general gist of it from small glances. I initially thought it had similar vibes to Death Stranding, but then came the base-building mechanic similar to Fallout Shelter or XCOM. But then came the social survival and deep, thought-provoking existential themes within the characters and story, which is probably a signature for 11 bit studios, the same studio that made Frostpunk.\r\n</div>\r\nThis is a game that wraps an addictive strategic loop inside a deep, thought-provoking narrative about existence itself, creating one of the most compelling and surprising experiences of the year.\r\n\r\nAt its core, The Alters features a deep and rewarding base-building loop that will hook anyone with a strategic mind. You are Jan Dolski, a simple worker stranded on a hostile alien planet, and your only hope for survival is a massive, mobile wheel base that you must constantly expand and maintain. The gameplay is an intricate dance of resource management; you'll send Alters out on expeditions, refine materials, manage power consumption, and carefully plan the layout of your base.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-16-the-alters-2.avif\r\n    alt=\"The Alters\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nThe building system itself is simple but effective, offering a great deal of freedom in how you construct and connect different modules. This freedom extends outside the base as well, allowing you to strategically place remote mining structures and link them back to your main facility with a network of power pylons. Exploration in The Alters is a another important part of the survival loop, driven by the constant, desperate need for resources to expand your base and keep your Jans alive. You'll need to scan the alien landscape to identify points of interest. These include rich resource deposits—like metals, organic matter, or chemicals. This is where the tension comes in. The planet is bathed in lethal radiation from its star, and your Alters can only survive outside for a limited time before the radiation levels become fatal. As a player, you must manage this time limit carefully.\r\n</div>\r\nThere's a tangible satisfaction, similar to games like Factorio or Satisfactory, that comes from creating a perfectly efficient, self-sustaining system that is safe from radiation, has decent food for everyone, plenty of extra supplies, and has enough power to move the base around. Something in your brain just clicks, compelling you to play for hours more just to optimize one more production line or research one more upgrade.\r\n\r\nThis addictive gameplay is in service of a narrative that is shockingly deep and can pull its own weight, and I would say, the story is so compelling and thought-provoking that it doesn't just pull its own weight, it probably carries the gameplay altogether. This is a signature of 11 bit studios, the same minds behind Frostpunk, and their talent for incorporating heavy themes into gameplay is on full display. The story tackles fascinating topics I had never considered before, all centered around cloning, alternate realities, and existential crises.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-16-the-alters-3.avif\r\n    alt=\"The Alters\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\nThe true genius is in how you get more \"workers\": you create alternate versions of yourself, the Alters. These aren't just generic colonists; they are born from pivotal, life-altering decisions in Jan's past. What if Jan had become a scientist instead of a worker? What if he had pursued his passion for botany? You create these \"what ifs\" as living, breathing people. The narrative forces you to confront the consequences, as these Alters come with their own unique personalities, skills, memories, and traumas from the lives they lived. Managing their conflicting desires and shared existential dread becomes a core part of the social survival mechanics. The thought-provoking story alone would be worth the price of admission, but we're lucky that the addicting gameplay itself is also as strong.\r\n</div>\r\nVisually, the game has a distinct and powerful art style that creates a compelling, lonely atmosphere against the alien landscape. However, the polish is uneven, and you can clearly see some \"UE5 jank\" in places. My experience with performance was also a mixed bag. On a high-end PC (RTX 5080 and Ryzen 7 5700X3D), the game was unfortunately quite stuttery, with inconsistent framerates that broke the immersion. In contrast, the Xbox Series X version, despite having noticeably blurrier visuals, delivered silky-smooth performance. \r\n\r\n---\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6 mb-12 pb-6 border-b border-slate-700\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=/images/reviews/2025-07-16-the-alters-4.avif\r\n    alt=\"The Alters\"\r\n    class=\"w-full md:w-2/5 rounded shadow\"\r\n     />\r\n <div>\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n**The Alters** is a brilliant and unexpected fusion of addictive base-building strategy and compelling existential storytelling that truly makes it a unique experience that caters to your brain's dopamine receptors in more ways than one. Though hampered by the usual UE5 jank, its highly engaging gameplay loop and mature, thought-provoking themes make it a standout release that I simply could not put down until the end. It has firmly cemented its place as my \"surprise game\" of the year and a must-play for anyone seeking a survival game with both brains and a profound, melancholic heart.\r\n</div></div>",

    "body": "**Chained Echoes** is an indie game that will give you a sense of familiarity if you have a broad knowledge on various JRPG franchises, notable references include Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, to name a few. Some cut scenes are familiar to the player because of its references to older games, and it is known to break the fourth wall, especially when it comes to character banter.\r\n\r\nThe game allows you to allocate skills and stats to your liking - and can be restrictive during the early game because of the pacing of the story, however, it will be trivial once you are familiar with the Overdrive mechanic. It is a complement to the turn-based feature that tries to maintain your skill types by not just spamming the same skill all over and the game itself did a great job on handling this.\r\n\r\nThe story emphasizes the motivations of the characters, where you actually get to know the characters behind the scenes. On the other hand, the character banters are the best moments to break the ice when there are certain scenes that are serious.\r\n\r\nThe reward board can feel like a chore if you are planning to maximize the game has to offer. Getting the rest of the classes and its related items can be locked through reward boards - which requires you to do certain gimmicks like killing a certain enemy using only the protagonist.\r\nThe music is a reminiscent of the old school JRPGs, and they were able to keep the music as relaxing as possible, while maintaining the theme of the game. I would say that the cut scenes really match with the music - especially during the heartbreaking scenes. \r\n\r\nOverall, I would still recommend this game for a timeless classic, as someone who loves JRPG, **Chained Echoes** is a must try for people who loves turn based games!",

    "body": "This was the first HD-2D game Square Enix developed along with Acquire. This is a good spiritual successor of Bravely Default but this game can be a huge time sink due to eight characters having different stories. Characters you have recruited during the course of your playthrough will scale accordingly depending on the number of travelers you have recruited after. \r\n\r\nYou start the game by picking the character of your choosing which is a nice touch and a huge upgrade to the JRPG class system based on your class preference. What I liked about the game itself is that it allows you to have interactions with NPCs that allows you to purchase items that are normally missing through the shops and armorer, inquire to gain valuable information and to be more receptive with certain actions in the field, challenge to a battle to gain item drops that are not normally present through other means of acquiring and guide the NPC which allows the said NPC to be summoned during battles.\r\n\r\nThis game has a lot of flexibility in terms of exploring the world since you can go to different regions to your heart's content. You can choose to continue the next chapter of the character's tale or choose to explore the rest of the world. Everything else is up to you.\r\n\r\nSoundtrack is great and there is so much to love for the background music.\r\n\r\nFor completionists, you will need to play the game at a slower pace that requires you to analyse non-one time encounters enemies without missing its entries. Once you recruited travelers, the danger level will increase. Good thing that one-time encounters such as bosses for each chapter are not required. It may be possible to miss enemies and not exploit its weaknesses if you are playing blindly.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty curve of this game makes the game feel like a drag if you are still not familiar with the abilities of the classes of your travelers which can make the battle not just lengthier, but the lack of familiarity of the travelers' ability itself can punish you at times at a later chapter. Utilising support skills can change the tide of the battle as well as purchasing Job Points to learn new abilities for the travelers to use for its related subclass. Not to mention, punishing drop rates just to get certain items can make the game feel like a gacha game. Getting more experience points just to align with the danger level on later chapters can also make your playthrough a bit longer if you're not really focusing on maintaining traveler levels.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Octopath Traveler is a beautiful game that totally nails the old-school JRPG vibe. It doesn't hold your hand, and it can be a serious time sink, but if you're willing to put in the effort to learn its deep systems, the payoff is a seriously rewarding and nostalgic adventure. It’s a game that asks for a lot of your time, but it definitely gives you a rich experience in return.",
